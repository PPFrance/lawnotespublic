It could be put in terms of an express trust for the lender without, in most situations, making any difference except for preventing the beneficiary, if a resulting trust is the preferred reading, from calling in the loan as long as the purpose could be fulfilled.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Competing Analyses</span></span></p><p><ol><li><span class="nl"><span class="lnk caseln">Express Trust</span> <span class="bd">for the third parties</span> &mdash; the conventional view...<br>... and that of Lord Wilberforce in <span class="lnk caseln">Quistclose</span>, the third party beneficiaries being the shareholders of Rolls Razor. The trust failed for inability due to receivership and became replaced by a resulting trust.</span><ul><li><span class="nl">This fails to explain Quistclose cases (see Virgo p.272) where identifiable beneficiaries do <span class="bd">not</span> lie behind the purpose, such trusts (non-charitable <span class="lnk caseln">Purpose Trusts</span>) being generally void.</span><ul><li><span class="nl">N.B., on the <span class="lnk caseln">Beneficiary Principle</span>, a trust purporting to be for a purpose will succeed if those who will benefit can be identified &mdash; <span class="lnk caseln">Re Denley</span>.</span></li></ul><li><span class="nl">As Lord Millett observed in <span class="lnk caseln">Twinsectra</span>, the beneficiaries of a private express trust <span class="bd">are at liberty to terminate</span> the trust and <span class="bd">transfer the property to themselves</span>. The insolvency in <span class="lnk caseln">Quistclose</span>, therefore, ought not have been an obstacle to the third parties&#8217; receiving their dividend &mdash; as the beneficial interest <span class="bd">never lay with Rolls Razor</span> for them subsequently to be prohibited from disbursing to the shareholders.</span></li></ul><li><span class="nl"><span class="lnk caseln">Express Trust</span> <span class="bd">for the lender</span><br>Lord Hoffmann in <span class="lnk caseln">Twinsectra</span> favoured this analysis.

Favoured by Chambers in <span class="it">Resulting Trusts</span>. Used in the Court of Appeal in <span class="lnk caseln">Twinsectra</span>, but rejected in the Lords by Millett on grounds that such a construction &mdash;</span><ul><li><span class="nl">Is inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the borrower &mdash; <span class="lnk caseln">Twinsectra</span>, is inconsistent with the requirement of separation of funds, and fails to explain how the lender can have a proprietary right.</span></li></ul><li><span class="nl"><span class="lnk caseln">Resulting Trusts</span> <span class="bd">from the word go</span>. According to Lord Millett in <span class="lnk caseln">Twinsectra</span>, a Quistclose trust is really a resulting trust in which the borrower, the beneficiary, has a <span class="bd">power to dispose of the beneficial interest for the specific purpose</span>. Should that purpose become frustrated, the settlor can revoke the power and enforce the trust.</span><ul><li><span class="nl">The retention by the settlor of beneficial interest implies, however, that it must be an <span class="lnk caseln">Automatic Resulting Trusts</span>. However, such trusts arise only when an <span class="bd">express trust</span> has failed. But this analysis makes no suggestion of an express trust and ventures no explanation for how an automatic resulting trust can arises in default.</span></li><li><span class="nl">Furthermore, typically in Quistclose cases, the transfer of beneficial interest from X to Z does not fail. So the trust <span class="bd">cannot</span> be said to have failed.</span></li><li><span class="nl">In Virgo&#8217;s opinion (pp.281), either Lord Millett has invented a third category of resulting trusts, or his analysis is incorrect.</span></li></ul></ol></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
