L had abandoned his post and had travelled to another island where his former partner worked in a bar as a waitress. At the bar L opened fire with a police service revolver and H was seriously injured. L pleaded guilty to charges of unlawful and malicious wounding and having a firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm. H brought civil proceedings against L and the Attorney General as the representative of the BVI Government. The Attorney General submitted that the Government owed no duty of care to H in respect of the persons to whom the police entrusted firearms as there was no sufficiently proximate relationship between the police authorities and H.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that (1) the Government was not vicariously liable for L&#8217;s actions. L was &#8220;on a frolic of his own&#8221; having deliberately and consciously abandoned his post and his duties. L&#8217;s wrongful use of the gun was not so closely connected with acts he was authorised to do that, for the purposes of the liability of the Government as his employer, his wrongful use could be regarded as made by him in the ordinary course of his employment; (2) the police authorities had been negligent in permitting L to have access to a revolver. The police authorities knew or ought to have known that L was not a fit and proper person to be entrusted with a gun because, until his domestic problems were resolved, he was volatile and unstable. L&#8217;s deliberate, wrongful conduct did not constitute an intervening event so as to relieve the Government of liability. The case was not one of omission because the alleged duty of care related to entrusting L with access to the gun. The standard of diligence expected of a reasonable person when entrusting another with a gun was high. The police plainly owed a duty to the public at large to take reasonable care to see that police officers to whom they entrusted weapons were suitable. The wide reach of the duty was proportionate to the gravity of the risks. It was reasonably foreseeable that someone like L might take and use the weapon for his own purposes. The police owed a duty of care to H in respect of damage arising in the way it did. Given L&#8217;s previous history the police authorities had failed to exercise the degree of care the situation demanded and were in breach of their duty to H.</div></div> </div>

(2) The relationship between the management of a nightclub and its guests was of sufficient proximity to justify the existence of a duty of care. It was foreseeable that there was some risk that one guest might assault another; that was recognised by C&#8217;s own risk assessment. It was fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the management of a nightclub in respect of injuries caused by a third party, provided that the scope of the duty was appropriately set (paras 31-33). (3) Thus there was a duty on the management of a nightclub in respect of the actions of third parties on the premises but the standard of care imposed or the scope of the duty had also to be fair, just and reasonable. As between the managers of a nightclub and guests, there should not be a higher degree of foreseeability than was required under the common duty of care in the Occupiers&#8217; Liability Act 1957, Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd [1970] A.C. 1004 considered. The degree of proximity, including the economic relationship, between the two was so close that no special rule of foreseeability was required in the interests of fairness, justice and reasonableness. The judge did not misdirect himself when he adopted the Australian case of Chordas v Bryant (Wellington) (1988) 91 A.L.R. 149 as the basis of the duty, Chordas considered (paras 34, 35). (4) In all the circumstances, K had not been in breach of duty. She had realised that there was a possibility of a confrontation between G and one or more of the members of E&#8217;s group. But there was no reason to think that a confrontation was imminent. The incident to which B had taken exception had occurred a considerable time earlier. B had no previous history of causing trouble, either himself or through his associates. K could not have been criticised even if she had done nothing. As it was, she went to speak to her manager. That was a reasonable thing for her to do. There was no apparent urgency; it was not as if a confrontation had begun and the risk of violence was imminent (para.37).</p></div></div> </div>

The ambulance took 38 minutes to arrive, although a crew member had falsely recorded the arrival time. K suffered a respiratory arrest with catastrophic results, including substantial memory impairment, personality change and a miscarriage. K brought an action, inter alia, against the London Ambulance Service, LAS, alleging negligence in failing to respond promptly and in failing to give her oxygen continuously in the ambulance. LAS was found liable in damages, since in the particular circumstances they owed a duty of care to K as an individual patient. The judge held that there was no reasonable excuse for the delay and, because it was a highly probable that K would not have suffered a respiratory arrest but for the delay, LAS was culpable. LAS appealed contending that its situation was analogous to that of the police and fire brigade, who owed no common law duty of care to the public at large.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that an ambulance service could owe a duty of care to an individual member of the public, once an emergency phone call providing the personal details of that person had been accepted by the service and LAS was liable in damages to K. The situation with LAS could be distinguished from that of the police force and fire service, since they served to protect the general public, whereas the service provided by LAS, as part of the health service, was more akin to that which was provided by hospitals to individual patients, Alexandrou v Oxford [1993] 4 All E.R. 328 and Capital and Counties Plc v Hampshire CC [1997] Q.B. 1004 distinguished. In the instant case, only K&#8217;s welfare was at issue and there was no conflict of priorities, therefore the requirement of foreseeability necessary to establish sufficient proximity was made out.</div></div> </div>

The test was that of foreseeability, proximity and fairness, justice and reasonableness, Caparo followed. It was not necessary for a claimant to show that the defendant had assumed any responsibility for some aspect of his or her safety. If the judge thought that assumption of responsibility was a pre-requisite for the existence of a duty of care that would have been an error of law. It was just one aspect of the wider issue of whether it was fair, just and reasonable to impose the duty of care. However, the judge had not fallen into that error (see paras 50-51 of judgment). (2) The judge appeared to have thought that before an assumption of responsibility could arise, something positive to that effect had to have been said or done which clearly indicated such assumption. However, it was possible to infer an assumption of responsibility from circumstances, Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2009] UKHL 11, [2009] 1 A.C. 874 followed and Silva&#8217;s Fishing Corp v Maweza 1957 (2) S.A. 256 considered. The judge had failed to consider whether an assumption of responsibility could be inferred from the protocol or working arrangements between the respondents. The judge had therefore erred in that respect (para.52). (3) Factors relating to foreseeability of harm and proximity of the relationship often also impinged on the question of fairness, justice and reasonableness. Where the defendant was a public authority, there would be important additional factors of public policy to be considered, Van Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire [2008] UKHL 50, [2009] 1 A.C. 225 considered. Nevertheless, there might be some classes of claimant who stood in such a special relationship with the defendant public authority that it would be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care. A defendant would owe the employer&#8217;s duty of care to its employees despite there being a potential conflict of interest between that duty and the defendant&#8217;s duties to the recipients of its core services. If a duty was owed to a limited class of employees for the action of a third party, the force of some of the policy considerations was less than if the duty was said to be owed to the world at large. The judge had failed to consider S&#8217;s special position. Taking the particular relationship between the parties into account, it would be open to a trial judge to conclude that it was fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on R2 and R3 (paras 53-56). (4) It was also arguable that the respondents might have breached S&#8217;s rights under the European Convention on Human Rights art.2. The case was remitted for trial on both issues (paras 57-58).</p></div></div> </div>

Therefore the court had a discretion to decline to hear an application for judicial review of issues that had been, or could have been, the subject of statutory review.</p><p>The appellant asylum seekers (M and G), who had come from Zimbabwe and Iran respectively, appealed against a decision ([2004] EWHC 588, [2004] 1 W.L.R. 2953) that it was an abuse of process for an asylum seeker to apply for judicial review of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal&#8217;s refusal to allow an application under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 s.101(1) . M and G, in separate cases, had had their applications to appeal under s.101(2) refused. M submitted that it was unjust that asylum seekers be restricted to s.101(2), which involved no right to an oral hearing and carried no right, in the event of refusal, of appeal to the Court of Appeal. G submitted that immigration decisions fell within the ambit of the procedural obligations inherent in the Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.2 , Art.3, Art.5, Art.6 and Art.8 and the refusal to grant permission to judicially review decisions of the IAT constituted discrimination against foreign nationals contrary to Art.14.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeals, that (1) the statutory regime, including statutory review under s.101(2) of a refusal of permission to appeal, provided adequate and proportionate protection of an asylum seeker&#8217;s rights. The power of judges to review the legality of administrative decisions was a cornerstone of the rule of law. However, the court had a discretion to decline to hear an application for judicial review of issues that had been, or could have been, the subject of statutory review. The court had been correct to consider whether an alternative remedy was proportionate when deciding whether to exercise its power of judicial review. Parliament&#8217;s wish to process asylum applications expeditiously was a legitimate objective of s.101. Section 101 provided for scrutiny of individual cases on paper. That scrutiny was adequate because judges of the Administrative Court were experienced and understood the importance of the decisions they were making. They were unlikely to overlook an error of law, R. (on the application of Sivasubramaniam) v Wandsworth County Court [2002] EWCA Civ 1738, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 475 and Sengupta v Holmes [2002] EWCA Civ 1104, Times, August 19, 2002 considered. (2) Although it was possible to raise an argument under Art.14 there were two reasons why any potential breach could be justified objectively. Firstly, as Art.5(1)(f) recognised, non nationals seeking entry or asylum stood in a fundamentally different situation from those who could enter or remain by right. The courts would ensure due process for them so far as possible, but due process did not necessarily mean the same process for all. Secondly, whilst different from other available forms of recourse to the courts, s.101 was not deficient or unjust to an extent requiring alternative recourse by way of judicial review.</div></div> </div>

(2) M had pled a relevant common law case against S and were entitled to a proof: the duty cast on S was said to have been to take reasonable care in the performance of their work as environmental consultants for the safety of those whom they knew would occupy the houses to be built on the land, that it was their responsibility to investigate for contamination and to remediate, and in the circumstances of this case, it was not arguable that it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose such a duty of care on S, Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2008] CSIH 19, 2008 S.C. 351, distinguished ; it would not be possible until after proof to determine the precise nature and extent of S&#8217;s duties to M over the entire period of S&#8217;s involvement in the development but M had averred enough to entitle them to an inquiry. (3) M&#8217;s case against L fell to be dismissed: in so far as M&#8217;s case relied on the provisions of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, it was based on a misconstruction of the implied terms on which they founded, statutory and common law made it clear that a landlord&#8217;s obligations related to the repair of the fabric of the let property itself, in respect of which M had averred no defect; thereafter in respect of the alleged breach of statutory duty in the context of the 2001 Act, there was no averment that before the commencement of the Scottish secure tenancy or of when M became joint tenants, that L had failed to ensure that the house was reasonably fit for human habitation. (4) M&#8217;s contention that either C or S were in breach of s.33(1) of the 1990 Act had to be rejected: M had offered to prove, and had relevantly averred, that the ash, slag, volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, and the ground contaminated thereby, in the part of the site where M&#8217;s homes were built was controlled waste for the purposes of Pt II of the Act, but M was specific about the dates when such waste was redistributed, namely the first quarters of 1993 and 1994, following the completion of which, S had issued a certificate of substantial completion in respect of which M contended that an act of deposit continued indefinitely but the contention that s.33(1) applied to a continuing state of affairs was misplaced, Thames Waste Management Ltd v Surrey CC [1997] Env. L.R. 148, considered . (5) M&#8217;s averments of causation were sufficient to entitle them to lead evidence to the effect that they had each suffered injury to their health as a result of the inhalation of solvents which, but for S&#8217;s fault, would have been discovered and removed before their homes were built. (6) On the time bar issue, M&#8217;s position was that neither had been aware until sometime after September 2009 that their injuries were attributable in whole, or in part, to an act or omission thus on the face of it, their right of action had expired and if postponement of the commencement of the triennium were to be put in issue, it would be for M to do so by asserting that it would not have been reasonably practicable to have become aware that their injuries were attributable, in whole or in part, to an act or omission so that the defenders would be given an opportunity to assert the contrary; it might be that all M required to add was a formal averment to the effect that it would not have been reasonably practicable for them to have acquired knowledge that the injuries were caused by an act or omission until a date falling after September 2009, and the case would be put out by order to allow M&#8217;s advisers the opportunity to consider the sufficiency of their pleadings.</p></div></div> </div>

P&#8217;s claims were based on allegations that their children&#8217;s illness or injuries had been negligently misdiagnosed as having a non accidental origin and that as a result of that misdiagnosis P had suffered a recognised form of psychiatric injury and in some cases financial loss. P submitted that the health care professionals&#8217; duty to exercise due skill and care in the investigation of suspected abuse extended to the child&#8217;s parents as primary carers as well as to the child.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeals (Lord Bingham dissenting), that (1) health professionals responsible for investigating suspected child abuse did not owe the person suspected of having committed the abuse a duty sounding in damages if they carried out that investigation in good faith but carelessly. At common law alleged interference with family life did not justify according a suspected parent a higher level of protection than other suspected perpetrators. That was because there was a conflict between the interests of the parents and the child where the parent was the suspected abuser. Health professionals, acting in good faith in what they believed were the best interests of the child, should not be subject to potentially conflicting duties when deciding whether a child might have been abused, or whether their doubts should be communicated to others, or what further investigatory or protective steps should be taken, Sullivan v Moody 207 C.L.R. 562 considered. The appropriate level of protection for a parent suspected of abusing his child was that clinical and other investigations must be conducted in good faith. That afforded suspected parents a similar level of protection to that afforded generally to persons suspected of committing crimes. (2) The respondents did not owe substantially the same duty of care to P as to the children since P were not in sufficient proximity to give rise to a duty of care. As the Court of Appeal held, there were cogent reasons of public policy for holding that no common law duty of care should be owed to P and that it was accordingly not fair, just and reasonable to impose such a duty, Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman [1990] 2 A.C. 605 applied.</div></div> </div>

The public interest in effective and fair investigation and the prevention of criminal behaviour had fashioned the common law to protect those suspected of it from malice or bad faith, but not from a well-intentioned but negligent mistake. The basis for that distinction was the need to provide protection to those who had a duty to enforce the law in good faith from the imposition of a duty in negligence that could or might tend to inhibit them in the effective fulfilment of that duty. The development proposed would fundamentally distort the law of negligence in this area, putting at risk the protection for children which it provided in its present form. Article 8, with its wholly different legal construct of engaging liability without reference to a duty of care, complemented it in facilitating a similar protection through a mechanism for justification. The provision of a discrete Convention remedy through the medium of the Human Rights Act 1998 did not, on that account, necessitate a change of the common law in the manner proposed. The instant court and the House of Lords had recently clarified in East Berkshire the relevant principles of the common law, including the effect or lack of effect in relation to that issue of the impact of the 1998 Act, concluding that they precluded the existence of such a duty to the parent. That reasoning still stood, East Berkshire followed, Brooks v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24, [2005] 1 W.L.R. 1495, Sullivan v Moody 207 C.L.R. 562 and B v Attorney General of New Zealand [2003] UKPC 61, [2003] 4 All E.R. 833 applied, and TP v United Kingdom (28945/95) [2001] 2 F.L.R. 549 and Venema v Netherlands (35731/97) [2003] 1 F.L.R. 552 considered.</p></div></div> </div>

The applicability of the three-stage test in Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman [1990] 2 A.C. 605 to negligence claims against the police was affirmed in Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [2014] EWCA Civ 15, [2014] P.I.Q.R. P14. The requirement of foreseeability was satisfied. M had made credible express threats against police officers. The possibility that he might carry them out was not merely foreseeable, but foreseen. The second requirement, proximity, was also satisfied. The real issue was whether the imposition of a duty was fair, just and reasonable. That was closely connected to the principle of public policy that the police were generally under no duty of care in respect of activities inextricably bound up with the investigation and prevention of crime, Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1989] A.C. 53 followed. In particular, no private law duty was owed to protect individuals against harm caused by criminals. A chief constable owed officers within his force a non-delegable duty to take reasonable care for their safety by ensuring both the provision and operation of a safe system of work, Mullaney v Chief Constable of the West Midlands [2001] EWCA Civ 700, [2001] Po. L.R. 150 applied. That was a different starting point to cases brought by members of the public. The duty as a quasi employer could, however, be excluded as a matter of public policy, or because it would not be fair, just and reasonable for such a duty to exist, Hill followed. That was more likely in cases involving operational decisions taken under pressure. That was a particularly important consideration where there was a risk that imposition of a duty would give rise to &#8220;defensive policing&#8221;, or in circumstances which involved the performance of the &#8220;core functions&#8221; of the police, Robinson applied. In such cases, the important public policy was likely to outweigh the public interest in the performance of the chief constable&#8217;s duty as a quasi employer (see paras 84-108 of judgment).</p><p>(2) It would not be fair, just or reasonable for a duty of care to be owed in the instant circumstances, Caparo and Robinson applied. That was not to say that the superintendent had made the right decision. Rather, it meant that, even if the decision was negligent, the policy decision was that there should be no private law claim for negligence in order to ensure that the police&#8217;s ability to perform their public functions in the interests of the community, fearlessly and with despatch, was not impeded. That policy decision bore harshly on R, but that was a consequence the law was prepared to accept in the overall public interest. That did not mean that the police owed no duty at all or that a victim of police misconduct had no remedy. There might, in appropriate circumstances, be a claim under ECHR art.2 or a private law claim for misconduct in public office. However, the only claim advanced in the instant case was in negligence, for which a private law duty of care was an essential element of the cause of action. On the instant facts, no such duty existed (paras 109-115).</p><p>(3) That was sufficient to dismiss the claim. However, the superintendent&#8217;s decision to await the imminent arrival of cell site analysis and to have the 999 call listened to properly before issuing any warning to officers was reasonable, even if other commanders might have taken a different course. The superintendent had to operate, under pressure, in a complex operation, with no time for full reflection. Stripping away sympathy for R and hindsight knowledge of the imminence of M&#8217;s attack on him, the superintendent had made a decision at which other commanders facing a similar dilemma would also have arrived. Her decision could not be regarded as negligent. The operation was not flawless, but the failings had no bearing on the outcome of the case (paras 117-140).</p><p>(4) The claimants had also not proved, on the balance of probabilities, that a warning would have averted the injuries suffered by R (paras 141-148).</p></div></div> </div>

Under the test, the court had to be satisfied that the authorities knew or ought to have known &#8220;at the time&#8221; of the existence of &#8220;a real and immediate risk to the life&#8221; of an identified individual from the criminal acts of a third party. If they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk, the relevant positive obligation would have been violated. In G&#8217;s case, that test had not been met. The murder had been the action of a seriously disturbed and unpredictable individual, and it could not reasonably be said that R should have anticipated, from the information available to him at the time, that B constituted a risk to G&#8217;s life that was both real and imminent. It had been argued that by involving G in B&#8217;s prosecution, in particular by requesting him to be a witness at B&#8217;s trial, the police had exposed him to a risk to his life, thereby placing him in a special category of witnesses, not shared by all members of the public, to whom a lower threshold applied. However, the test in Osman was invariable and was not intended to impose a standard which might vary from case to case, Osman applied. (2) (Per Lord Hope) As to S&#8217;s claim in negligence, the balance of advantage in this difficult area lay in preserving the principle set out in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1989] A.C. 53 , whereby, in the absence of special circumstances, the police owed no common law duty of care to protect individuals against harm caused by criminals. In Brooks v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24, [2005] 1 W.L.R. 1495 Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said that there might be exceptional cases where the circumstances compelled the conclusion that the absence of a remedy sounding in damages would be an affront to the principles that underlay the common law. That approach was to be respected, but S&#8217;s case did not fall into that category. That was why, if a civil remedy was to be provided, there needed to be a more fundamental departure from the core principle in Hill . That should be resisted, in the interests of the wider community, Hill and Brooks followed. (3) (Per Lord Bingham) The Court of Appeal had been right to decide as it had in S&#8217;s case. If a member of the public (X) furnished a police officer (Y) with apparently credible evidence that a third party whose identity and whereabouts were known presented a specific and imminent threat to his life or physical safety, Y would owe X a duty to take reasonable steps to assess such threat and, if appropriate, take reasonable steps to prevent it being executed.</p></div></div> </div>

However, the Strasbourg jurisprudence showed that such a duty existed to protect persons from a real and immediate risk of suicide where they were under the state&#8217;s control, Osman v United Kingdom (23452/94) [1999] 1 F.L.R. 193, Oneryildiz v Turkey (48939/99) (No.1) (2004) 39 E.H.R.R. 12, Powell v United Kingdom (Admissibility) (45305/99) [2000] Inquest L.R. 19 and Savage v South Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust [2008] UKHL 74, [2009] 1 A.C. 681 considered. In the instant case, P owed an operational duty to M to take reasonable steps to protect her from the real and immediate risk of suicide. She had been admitted to hospital as a real suicide risk. She was extremely vulnerable and P had assumed responsibility for her. She was under its control. If she had insisted on leaving the hospital, the authorities could and should have exercised their powers under the 1983 Act to prevent her. In reality, the difference between M&#8217;s position and that of a hypothetical detained psychiatric patient in similar circumstances was one of form, not substance. M&#8217;s position was far closer to that of such a hypothetical patient than to a patient undergoing treatment in a public hospital for a physical illness. Those factors led to the conclusion that the operational duty existed in M&#8217;s case (see paras 15-34 of judgment). (2) There was a real risk that M would take her life when allowed home. That risk existed when she left hospital and continued and increased during the two days, which was sufficient to make the risk immediate. P were or ought to have been aware of that risk. The standard demanded for the performance of the operational duty was one of reasonableness, which included &#8220;consideration of the circumstances of the case, the ease or difficulty of taking precautions and the resources available&#8221;, Officer L, Re [2007] UKHL 36, [2007] 1 W.L.R. 2135 applied. The decision to allow M two days&#8217; home leave was one that no reasonable psychiatric practitioner would have made. P had failed to do all that could reasonably have been expected to prevent the real and immediate risk of M&#8217;s suicide (paras 35-43). (3) The ECtHR had repeatedly stated that family members could bring claims in their own right in relation to the investigative and substantive obligations under art.2 (paras 44-48). (4) R had not renounced an art.2 claim by settling the negligence claim. No such claim had been made in the negligence proceedings because it was not available in English law. In the absence of an express renunciation, the settlement had no legal effect on R&#8217;s status as victims for the purposes of their art.2 claim. There had been no adequate redress as there had been no compensation at all for the non-pecuniary damage suffered by R as a result of the breach of art.2, Bubbins v United Kingdom (50196/99) (2005) 41 E.H.R.R. 24 considered. Had it been necessary to decide the issue, P had in substance acknowledged its breach of the art.2 duty (paras 49-63, 64-72). (5) The extension of time would be granted. The required extension was short, P had suffered no prejudice by the delay, R had acted reasonably and, most importantly, they had a good claim for breach of art.2 (paras 73-79). (6) R had expressed their anxiety to the hospital about the dangers of allowing M home. That must have made M&#8217;s death all the more distressing. It was a bad breach of the art.2 duty, which merited an award well above the lower end of the range. R would be awarded £5,000 each (paras 80-88).</p></div></div> </div>

However, there were cases where it would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care and the interests of the public at large could outweigh the interests of the individual allegedly wronged (see para.39 of judgment). The Caparo test applied to all claims in the modern law of negligence, and was reflected in all the most recent appellate decisions which addressed in turn, whatever the nature of the harm, the issues of foreseeability, proximity and whether it was just and reasonable to impose a duty, Caparo applied (para.42). The Hill principle was designed to prevent defensive policing and better protect the public. It would fundamentally undermine that objective to make the police liable for direct acts but not indirect acts, and would encourage the police to avoid positive action for fear of being sued (para.44). The general principle was that most claims against the police in negligence for their acts or omissions in the course of investigating and suppressing crime and apprehending offenders would fail the third stage of the Caparo test. It would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty where the courts had concluded that the interests of the public would not be best served by imposing a duty to individuals, Hill, Brooks v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24, [2005] 1 W.L.R. 1495 and Van Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire [2008] UKHL 50, [2009] 1 A.C. 225 applied (para.46). However, the Hill principle did not impose a blanket immunity. While there was no definitive list of possible exceptions, there were exceptional cases in which the police did owe a duty of care even when suppressing and investigating crime, Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [1985] 1 W.L.R. 1242 considered. In principle, although there was sense in exempting cases of outrageous negligence on the basis no one wished to encourage grossly reckless police operations, such claims would be on the margins. A careful analysis of the case law would provide a sufficient degee of certainty. Accordingly, the Caparo test did apply to the instant case. It would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty on police officers doing their best to get a drug dealer off the street safely (paras 48, 50-51, 65-66). The judge recognised that there were a number of exceptions to the Hill principle and only considered whether outrageous negligence was present because the parties had addressed him on it. He did not find that a finding of outrageous negligence was the only way in which the principle could be defeated. The Hill principle did not apply in general to the law of negligence and to the facts of the instant case. The findings that a duty existed and that there was a breach were unsustainable (paras 62-63).</p></div></div> </div>

Nor did they owe such a duty where a member of the public had given them apparently credible evidence that an identifiable third party presented a specific and imminent threat to her life or physical safety.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed, cross-appeal dismissed.<p>(1) (Hale and Kerr JJ.S.C. dissenting) The first issue could be split into two questions. The first was whether the police owed a duty to take reasonable care for the safety of a person where they were aware, or ought reasonably to have been aware, of a threat to her life or physical safety. The answer was no. In general, English law did not impose liability for injury or damage caused by a third party. The courts&#8217; refusal to impose a private law duty on the police to exercise reasonable care to safeguard potential victims of crime, except where there had been a representation and reliance, was consistent with the way in which the common law applied to other authorities vested with powers or duties for the protection of the public. No exception was to be made to the ordinary common law principles so as to cover the facts of the instant case. Although statistics about the incidence of domestic violence were shocking, they were not such as to cause the court to create a new category of duty of care. If the foundation of a duty of care was the police&#8217;s public law duty to preserve the peace, it was hard to see why the duty should be confined to particular potential victims, or to potential victims of a particular kind of breach of the peace. The duty was owed to members of the public at large and did not involve the kind of proximity necessary for the imposition of a private law duty of care. Moreover, it was not clear whether imposing a duty of care in respect of a specific person would improve the police&#8217;s performance in dealing with domestic violence. It would, however, have potentially significant financial implications for the police and the public purse. The development of a private duty of care was not necessary for compliance with art.2 or art.3, and there was no basis for creating a wider duty in negligence than would arise either under common law principles or under the ECHR, Van Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire [2008] UKHL 50, [2009] 1 A.C. 225 followed (see paras 97-100, 114-128 of judgment). The second question was whether, where a member of the public had given the police credible evidence that a third party, whose identity and whereabouts were known, presented an imminent threat to her life or physical safety, the police owed her a duty to take reasonable steps to assess the threat and prevent it being executed. Again, the answer was no. Whether there should be a public compensation scheme for the victims of certain types of crime in cases of pure omission by the police was for Parliament to determine (paras 129-130). (2) The call handler had said nothing to M to give rise to an assumption of responsibility. She had made no promise about how quickly South Wales police would respond, and she had not said anything that amounted to an instruction to stay in the house, Kent v Griffiths (No.3) [2001] Q.B. 36 considered (para.138). (3) The art.2 claim turned on whether the call handler ought to have heard M say that there had been a threat to kill. That was a question of fact, and it would be rare for the instant court to reverse concurrent findings of two lower courts on a question of fact. What the call handler ought to have made of the 999 call was properly a matter for investigation at trial (para.139).</p></div></div> </div>

[1985] A.C. 168, could not be supported. The Supreme Court re-stated the principles concerning the liability of accessories or secondary parties.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeals allowed.<p>The Chan Wing Siu principle could not be supported. The introduction of the principle was based on an incomplete, and in some respects erroneous, reading of the previous case law, coupled with generalised and questionable policy arguments. Reversing a statement of principle which had been made and followed by the Privy Council and the House of Lords on a number of occasions was a big step, but it was right to do so for several reasons. First, the court had had the benefit of a much fuller analysis than on previous occasions when the topic was considered. Second, it could not be said that the law was now well established and working satisfactorily; it remained highly controversial and a continuing source of difficulty for trial judges. Third, secondary liability was an important part of the common law, and if a wrong turn had been taken, it should be corrected. Fourth, in the common law foresight of what might happen was ordinarily no more than evidence from which a jury could infer the presence of a requisite intention. It might be strong evidence, but its adoption as a test for the mental element for murder in the case of a secondary party was a serious and anomalous departure from the basic rule, which resulted in an over-extension of the law of murder and a reduction of the law of manslaughter. Murder already had a relatively low mens rea threshold, as it included an intention to cause serious injury, without intent to kill or to cause risk to life. The Chan Wing Siu principle extended liability for murder to a secondary party on the basis of a still lesser degree of culpability, namely foresight only of the possibility that the principal might commit murder but without there being any need for an intention to assist him to do so. Fifth, the rule had the striking anomaly of requiring a lower mental threshold for guilt in the case of the accessory than in the case of the principal, Chan Wing Siu disapproved. It would not be satisfactory for the court simply to disapprove the Chan Wing Siu principle. Those concerned with criminal justice, including members of the public, were entitled to expect a clear statement of the relevant principles. The proper course was to re-state the principles which had been established over many years before the law took a wrong turn. The error was to equate foresight with intent to assist, as a matter of law; the correct approach was to treat foresight as evidence of intent. The long-standing practice, before Chan Wing Siu , of inferring intent to assist from a common criminal purpose which included the further crime, if the occasion for it were to arise, was always a legitimate one; what was illegitimate was to treat foresight as an inevitable yardstick of common purpose. The court proceeded to re-state the relevant principles. It also addressed the potential impact of the instant decision on past convictions (see paras 79-84, 87-100 of judgment).</p></div></div> </div>

It was quite impractical for parents to keep children under constant supervision and it would not be in the public interest for the law to impose a duty upon them to do so. Some activities however involved an unacceptable risk to children unless they were subject to supervision. The standard of care required in the circumstances was that which a reasonably careful parent would have shown for her own children, or, which was the same thing, to act as would any reasonable provider and supervisor of that kind of inflatable for use by young children. In considering the precautions that should have been taken the judge should have had regard to any information in the hire agreement, which P had read, but wrongly had regard to other documents which P neither saw nor ought to have seen. The judge had erred and the appeal court had to form its own view. (2) The hire agreement recommended that the equipment should be supervised at all times and that boisterous behaviour should be stopped. A reasonable parent could foresee that boisterous behaviour might lead to injury but it was not reasonably foreseeable that such injury would be likely to be serious, let alone as severe as the injury sustained by H. Therefore the standard of care called for on the part of P was that appropriate to protect children against a foreseeable risk of physical harm that fell short of serious injury. (3) If the risk that should have been foreseen by a reasonable parent was injury that was not serious, there could be no justification for holding that the duty of care required children playing on a bouncy castle to be kept under constant surveillance. A responsible adult should have been in the vicinity of the castle to intervene if those playing on it got boisterous, but did not have to watch them continuously to ensure that their behaviour never became boisterous. The judge imposed too high a standard of care in holding that a bouncy castle required uninterrupted supervision. (4) It was doubtful whether P could have prevented the accident if she had been keeping the bouncy castle under constant surveillance. The issue was academic since the accident had occurred during a short period when, without fault, she was concentrating her attention elsewhere. (5) The judge also applied too high a standard of care when concluding that P was in breach of duty in allowing children of different sizes to play on the castle.</p></div></div> </div>

There was nothing in the relevant authorities to suggest that the breach of duty test had been altered in mesothelioma cases so that a claimant only had to demonstrate that the defendant failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the claimant or victim was not exposed to a material increase in the risk of mesothelioma, Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd (t/a GH Dovener &amp; Son) [2002] UKHL 22, [2003] 1 A.C. 32 and Sienkiewicz v Greif (UK) Ltd [2011] UKSC 10, [2011] 2 A.C. 229 considered (paras 39-45). (4) There was just sufficient evidence for the judge properly to make the finding that, on the balance of probability, the lagging was in poor condition in 1974 (para.52). However, on the then state of knowledge it had not been shown that, at the level of exposure to asbestos fibres actually found by the judge, U ought reasonably to have foreseen that W would be exposed to an unacceptable risk of asbestos related injury. Therefore the judge&#8217;s finding of breach of duty could not stand (paras 60-62). (5) The judge had not posed the correct legal test on causation, but she had concluded as a matter of fact that the exposure of W to asbestos fibres in the tunnel was such as materially to increase his risk of contracting mesothelioma so that causation had been proved (para.78).</p></div></div> </div>

The liquidators alleged that the £1.4 million had been paid for the five-year seat commitment and that was sufficient to establish what it was worth. There was no evidential lacuna. There was no lack of nexus between the alleged dishonesty and the alleged assistance. The issue of whether the deposits were a genuine part of the seat sale agreements was plainly put in issue by the pleadings and the judge was justified in allowing the liquidators to assert in the course of the trial that the deposits were not truly intended by the parties to be repayable. The judge had not behaved unfairly. The appeal on the findings of fact failed (see paras 34, 36, 40, 50, 60, 69-70 of judgment).</p><p>(2) The judge had addressed the wrong question when deciding not to reduce G&#8217;s equitable compensation for the recouped £500,000. The question was whether the appellants as dishonest assisters of the director in the misapplication of G&#8217;s monies should be required to compensate G for the loss of the extra £500,000 that G had in fact recovered. The director&#8217;s misapplication of G&#8217;s £500,000 did not cause G any loss because it was repaid.

Everyone accepted that scouting activities were valuable to society and that they often, and properly, carried some elements of risk. However, that did not render every scouting activity, however risky, acceptable. In the instant case, the judge rightly concluded that playing in the dark significantly increased those risks and that the only justification was the additional excitement. Darkness added no other social or educative value. The fact that the judge did not say so explicitly could not undermine his overall conclusion. Whether the social benefit of an activity was such that the degree of risk it entailed was acceptable was a question of fact, degree and judgment which had to be decided on an individual basis. The judge did that and his conclusion should be respected (paras 38, 46-49, 60).</p><p></p></div></div> </div>

(2) The lack of vital signs monitoring by nursing staff did not involve questions of diagnosis and treatment. The risk had been that S might not in fact have had a satisfactory normal pulse, temperature or blood pressure, but the judge had accepted that, at the relevant time, on the evidence they would have been within normal limits. As the risks involved were not of the kind that fell for consideration under the principles set out in Bolitho , they were therefore irrelevant, Bolitho considered. The nurse&#8217;s opinion, that it had been within proper nursing competence to leave S without making those observations, had a logical basis, in that it had been reasonable to decide to let a patient who had had little sleep since his operation continue to sleep. It was plain that the nurse had weighed up the risks and benefits. (3) It was clear that the judge had dealt with degrees of rousability. The judge&#8217;s finding as regards S&#8217;s rousability after 06.00, which was critical to the issue of causation and to his conclusions, had a firm evidential base, and had not been shown to be wrong. The judge had been entitled to accept the expert anaesthetist&#8217;s opinion as (a) the judge had been entitled to regard him as in general the more persuasive of the expert anaesthetists; (b) expert witnesses from other disciplines had deferred to the anaesthetists on the critical issues in the instant case; (c) the preferred expert had experience of the effect of morphine in the quantities taken by S on consciousness and levels of sedation. He was therefore entitled to say, based on his experience and opinion, that the amount of morphine taken by S would not make a patient such as him deeply unconscious; (d) if morphine did suppress the gag and cough reflex, it was not illogical for it to do so when the effect on a patient&#8217;s consciousness was less than profound, because a reflex was an action or function that occurred apart from consciousness; (e) the preferred expert&#8217;s evidence was supported by that of another expert, who had referred to S&#8217;s breathing rate as indicative that his consciousness was not severely depressed.</p></div></div> </div>

It was clear that the judge had applied the relevant tests, and such a conclusion was not inconsistent with the proposition that care proceedings would not necessarily have succeeded following various later incidents. Accordingly, there was evidential support for the judge&#8217;s conclusion. (2) The judge had also held that if P had not been returned home when he was, it was likely that he would have remained in care indefinitely. On the evidence, it was clear that everyone proceeded upon the basis that if the authority ought not to have returned P when it did, there was no realistic scope for a later return. Further, there had been no evidence from the authority that, had P not been returned, there would have been an attempt to return him later. (3) Although the instant case was a case of neglect rather than that of violence or abuse, the foreseeable loss had been injury through bad parenting, and it was impossible to say that the judge&#8217;s award lay outside the bracket properly available to him. (4) The judge had held that P&#8217;s knowledge of the authority&#8217;s breach was through the consideration of his care records, that he had only been able to obtain shortly before he issued the proceedings, and therefore he was within the limitation period. However, P had requested his file several years earlier, and the authority had offered to pay for his train fare for him to go and view them, but he failed to take up the appointments. Accordingly, it was clear that P had had constructive knowledge under s.14(3) of the 1980 Act, and his claim was out of time.

An adult person of sound mind was entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent had to be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity was undertaken. Doctors were under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that patients were aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>(1) Lord Scarman&#8217;s dissenting judgment in Sidaway took as a starting point the patient&#8217;s basic human right to make his own decision. He held that if a patient suffered damage as a result of an undisclosed risk which would have been disclosed by a doctor exercising reasonable care to respect the patient&#8217;s right to decide whether to incur the risk, and the patient would have avoided the injury if the risk had been disclosed, then the patient would have a cause of action based in negligence. In England and Wales, lower courts had tacitly ceased to apply the Bolam test in relation to the advice given by doctors to their patients, and had effectively adopted Lord Scarman&#8217;s approach, Pearce v United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust [1999] E.C.C. 167 approved, Wyatt v Curtis [2003] EWCA Civ 1779 considered. In Chester v Afshar [2004] UKHL 41, [2005] 1 A.C. 134, Lord Walker observed that during the time which had elapsed since Sidaway , the importance of personal autonomy had been more widely recognised, and that, in making a decision which might have a profound effect on her health and wellbeing, a patient was entitled to information and advice about possible alternative or variant treatments, Chester applied. Recent guidance issued by the Department of Health and the General Medical Council had treated Chester as the leading authority. It had become increasingly clear that the paradigm of the doctor-patient relationship implicit in the speeches in Sidaway had ceased to reflect the reality and complexity of the way in which healthcare services were provided, or the way in which the providers and recipients of such services viewed their relationship. Under the stimulus of the Human Rights Act 1998, the courts had become increasingly conscious of the extent to which the common law reflected fundamental values, including the value of self-determination. The analysis of the law by the majority in Sidaway was unsatisfactory, in so far as it treated the doctor&#8217;s duty to advise the patient of the risks of proposed treatment as falling within the scope of the Bolam test, subject to two qualifications of that general principle, neither of which was fundamentally consistent with that test. There was no reason to perpetuate the application of the Bolam test in that context any longer. An adult person of sound mind was entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent had to be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity was undertaken. The doctor was under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient was aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments. The test of materiality was whether, in the circumstances, a reasonable person in the patient&#8217;s position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor was or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it (see paras 39-87 of judgment). (2) There was no doubt that it was incumbent on C to advise M of the substantial risk of shoulder dystocia if a vaginal delivery were attempted, and to discuss with her the alternative of a caesarean section. The Court of Session had erred in focusing upon the consequent risk that the baby might suffer a grave injury, which was relatively small (para.94). (3) There was a compelling reason for concluding that the Court of Session had failed to consider relevant evidence in relation to causation, Thomas v Thomas [1947] A.C. 484 considered. The only conclusion available was that, had C advised M of the risk of shoulder dystocia and discussed with her dispassionately the potential consequences, and the alternative of an elective caesarean, M would probably have opted for the caesarean. It was not in dispute that the baby would then have been born unharmed (paras 96-104).</p></div></div> </div>

The claim was dismissed against the education authority and upheld against R on the basis that she must have appreciated that what she was doing was dangerous, that she had used excessive violence and that it was readily foreseeable that her conduct might cause an eye injury to M. A 50 per cent reduction was made for contributory negligence.

A mere possibility of injury was not enough, Bolton v Stone [1951] A.C. 850 applied. The question of foreseeability must be judged against the evidential background concerning the prevalence of the practice of fencing with plastic rulers, the absence of prohibition, the absence of warning against it or of its dangers and the absence of any evidence of any previous injury. Further there was no evidence to support the judge&#8217;s finding that M and R were guilty of using misdirected and dangerous force over and above that which was inherent in play fencing.

AH argued that such events could properly inform the judgment of whether the offence was serious, while the UNHCR submitted that words should be read into art.1F(b) so that it could be disapplied where to do so would be consistent with the Convention&#8217;s objects and purposes. Both arguments meant that the decision-maker would have to make a series of interlocking evaluations of matters such as the gravity of the offence, the passage of time, the age of the criminal at the time of the offence, the extent to which he posed a danger to the receiving state, any punishment he had suffered, and any atonement he had made. That was a wide-ranging and potentially open-ended exercise which amounted to the kind of proportionality assessment ruled out by the European Court of Justice in the parallel context of Directive 2004/83 art.12. Moreover, the various provisions of art.1 required the decision-maker to decide matters of objective fact and then to apply the exclusion or not, as the case dictated. They did not require him to evaluate the individual&#8217;s merits. The construction favoured by AH and the UNHCR would involve the decision-maker exercising a power retained by the Convention itself, namely judging whether the asylum seeker should obtain protection. The Convention did not authorise an inquiry into the asylum seeker&#8217;s character. Rather, it presumed that to give refugee status to anybody who had committed a crime of the stipulated gravity posed a risk to the systemic integrity and viability of refugee law. The mandatory, defining nature of art.1F(b) was confirmed by the Convention&#8217;s travaux preparatoires, and the Supreme Court had held that the exclusion clauses in the Convention had to be restrictively interpreted and cautiously applied, Al-Sirri v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] UKSC 54, [2013] 1 A.C. 745 followed. The Supreme Court of Canada had, by a majority, rejected identical submissions to those of AH and the UNHCR in Febles [2014] 3 SCR 431, and its reasoning would be adopted by the instant court, Febles considered (see paras 9-10, 14-15, 18-26, 28-33 of judgment). (2) To justify exclusion under art.1F(b), the offence had to be of the stipulated gravity. The phrase &#8220;serious crime&#8221; denoted especially grave offending. The word &#8220;serious&#8221; needed no further qualification, and the draftsman had not intended that it should be qualified by the word &#8220;particularly&#8221;, AH (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 395, [2012] 1 W.L.R. 3469 considered (paras 34-36). (3) There was nothing to suggest that the Upper Tribunal&#8217;s factual conclusions did not properly reflect the findings of the French court, or that the French court was not entitled to make the findings it did. The Upper Tribunal had properly accorded a significant degree of respect to the French court&#8217;s decision, but had also recognised that it alone had to decide whether AH&#8217;s conduct was sufficiently serious to justify exclusion. It concluded that he had knowingly been giving succour to a terrorist cause and had been doing so as a senior participant in the conspiracy. Although its findings lacked particularity, it was entitled to reach the conclusion it did.

Observed , per Lord Drummond Young, (1) that a distinction might properly be drawn between injury to the person and damage to property, consequently, it was hoped that in an appropriate case the law might develop in such a way that, at least in clear cases where action could be taken without danger to the rescuer, the officers of a public service such as the fire service or the police were obliged to take action to rescue persons in danger; (2) that the law had moved in the direction of attaching greater significance to the more traditional categorisation of distinct and recognisable situations as guides to the existence, scope and limits of the varied duties of care which the law imposed but rules derived from existing case law ought not to be applied mechanically to new situations, instead it should be asked whether, as a matter of policy directed to the specific situation under consideration, a new analysis was required, which would result in a law of negligence that was less unified than in the past but which dealt more fairly with individual cases.</p></div></div> </div>

C suffered repeated episodes of low back pain and had been referred for surgery to X, who was experienced in disc surgery. C underwent the surgery and suffered a rare complication known as cauda equina syndrome, a risk in respect of which X had failed to warn her in advance. The judge had not found that X had been negligent in the actual performance of the surgery. However, he had found that X had failed to warn C of the small risk that the operation could adversely affect her, and that had she been warned of the risk, she would not have undergone the surgery at the time she did.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal (Lords Bingham and Hoffmann dissenting), that a judgment in C&#8217;s favour could not be based on conventional causation principles.

But the risk of which she should have been warned was not created by the failure to warn. It was already there, as an inevitable risk of the operative procedure itself, however skillfully and carefully it was carried out. The risk was not increased, nor were the chances of avoiding it lessened, by what X had failed to say about it. However, the duty of a surgeon to warn of the dangers inherent in an operation was intended to help minimise the risk to the patient and was also intended to enable the patient to make an informed choice whether to undergo the treatment recommended and, if so, at whose hands and when. X had violated C&#8217;s right to choose for herself, even if he had not increased the risk to her. The function of the law was to enable rights to be vindicated and to provide remedies when duties had been breached. Unless that was done, the duty to warn would be a hollow one. On policy grounds the test of causation was satisfied in the instant case.

Med. 105) that his medical negligence claim against the defendant doctor (S) failed. G had visited S because he had a lump under his arm. S negligently misdiagnosed G&#8217;s condition as benign. A year later another general practitioner referred G to hospital for an examination and it was discovered that G had cancer of a lymph gland. By that time the tumour had spread to G&#8217;s chest. G suffered pain and had to undergo a course of chemotherapy. He was left with poor prospects of survival. G sued S, alleging that S should have referred him to hospital and that if S had done so his condition would have been diagnosed earlier and there would have been a high likelihood of a cure. The judge held that on the expert evidence the delay in diagnosis had reduced G&#8217;s chances of surviving for more than 10 years from 42 per cent to 25 per cent. He therefore dismissed G&#8217;s action because the delay had not deprived G of the prospect of a cure, meaning surviving more than 10 years, because, at the time of his misdiagnosis, G had less than a 50 per cent chance of surviving more than 10 years anyway. The Court of Appeal dismissed G&#8217;s appeal. G submitted that (1) the delay in diagnosis and treatment had caused physical injury, in the shape of the spread of the cancer before his therapy began, and the losses he had suffered were consequential on that physical damage; (2) apart from any other injury, the reduction in his chances of survival was itself a compensatable head of damage.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal (Lord Nicholls and Lord Hope dissenting), that (1) even if the quantification of future losses was conventionally decided on the evaluation of risks and chances, G had to show that the loss was consequential on injury caused by S&#8217;s negligence. Causation had to be shown on the balance of probabilities. On the judge&#8217;s findings it had not been shown that on the balance of probabilities the delay in commencing G&#8217;s treatment that was attributable to S&#8217;s negligence had affected the course of his illness or his prospects of survival, which had never been as good as even. (2) Liability for the loss of a chance of a more favourable outcome should not be introduced into personal injury claims. (3) (Per Lord Nicholls and Lord Hope) The significant reduction in the prospects of a successful outcome for G which S&#8217;s negligence caused was a loss for which G was entitled to be compensated. The fact that G was already suffering from illness at the date of S&#8217;s negligence, from which G had at that date significant prospects of recovery, provided him with a cause of action for the reduction in those prospects that resulted from the negligence. What had to be valued was what G had lost, and the principle on which that loss had to be calculated was the same, irrespective of whether the prospects were better or less than 50 per cent.</div></div> </div>

(3) It was enough for B to establish that, on the balance of probabilities, a lack of care made a material contribution, namely something greater than negligible, to the weakness of her condition, although that was not an application of the &#8220;but for&#8221; test.

(on the application of Edwards) v Environment Agency (No.2) [2008] UKHL 22, [2008] 1 W.L.R. 1587 considered. (2) Great caution was required before any development of the exception to the &#8220;but for&#8221; test of causation should be allowed, Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd (t/a GH Dovener &amp; Son) [2002] UKHL 22, [2003] 1 A.C. 32 and Barker v Corus UK Ltd [2006] UKHL 20, [2006] 2 A.C. 572 considered. However, the conditions set out in Fairchild in relation to mesothelioma, which might justify the relaxation of the test, were not intended to exclude the application of the exception to other diseases and circumstances. An essential element for the extension of the exception was to be the impossibility for the claimant to prove enough to satisfy the &#8220;but for&#8221; test: mere difficulty of proof would not be enough, Fairchild considered. In the instant case, the recorder had not properly analysed the facts relating to negligence and causation. The recorder&#8217;s difficulties in reaching a conclusion on causation were created not by any impossibility of proof but by his failure to make crucial findings of fact. If the necessary findings of fact had been made, he would have been able to make a decision on the usual &#8220;but for&#8221; basis. If he had held that, if properly warned, H would have been careful not to touch her face whilst working, he might then have been able to say that she would probably not have done so although he might have recognised that a small risk remained that she would do so. If he had accepted that, if warned, H would not have discarded the gloves, he could then have held that it was unlikely that her hands would have been infected. Finally, he would have had to recognise that there was some risk of contact from door handles and other places that could not have been reduced or avoided by any amount of warning. If findings of that kind had been made, it would have been open to the recorder to hold that, on the balance of probabilities, H would not have been infected. Therefore, the instant case was not one in which it was impossible for H to prove causation. The crucial issues were not incapable of proof, which was a necessary feature if a case was to be brought within the Fairchild exception. Accordingly, the recorder was wrong to hold that the case fell within the Fairchild exception.</p></div></div> </div>

W had not switched from one oral contraceptive to another over the space of one or more cycles. She had merely reduced the level of one of the two hormones supplied, progesterone, by 100mcg or, at most, 200mcg. None of the medical studies, which were referred to, covered that situation. Added to that was the absence of any biological explanation as to why the reduction in the level of progesterone to a level, which was found to be adequate to prevent ovulation, should have caused pregnancy in the instant case. No reasons were advanced by W for substituting a different conclusion to that of the judge either to the efficacy of Microgynon over Logynon or as to the consequences of taking what was described as two wrong pills. The judge was entitled, on analysis of the material available and on the basis of the evidence of experts relied on by X, to reject J&#8217;s views about the increase in risk. There was no basis for challenging the judge&#8217;s findings of fact. That was sufficient to dispose of the appeal. (2) W had failed to establish that the erroneous intake of two Logynon pills materially increased the risk of contraceptive failure. She could not invoke any principle identified in Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd (t/a GH Dovener &amp; Son) [2002] UKHL 22, [2003] 1 A.C. 32 or Barker v Corus UK Ltd [2006] UKHL 20, [2006] 2 A.C. 572 to overcome the judge&#8217;s finding that the reduction of 100mcg or 200mcg or progesterone did not increase, let alone materially increase, the risk of contraceptive failure, Fairchild and Barker considered. Whether the instant case was to be regarded as a case in which W had to satisfy the &#8220;but for&#8221; test for causation or whether the principle in Fairchild and Barker could be extended and applied to the instant case was immaterial. The judge had not found as a fact that the intake of two Logynon pills gave rise to additional risk. Whether the risk due to the reduced intake of progesterone was to be regarded as a risk distinct from the inherent risk of contraceptive failure or merely a risk which increased the inherent risk, W had failed to establish any risk, attributable to so limited a reduction of progesterone, at all.</p></div></div> </div>

The respondent in the first case (B) had died of asbestos related mesothelioma. During his working career he had had three material exposures to asbestos. The first two exposures were in consequence of breaches of duty by the employers, the second employer being the first appellant (C). The third exposure was while B was working as a self-employed plasterer and involved a failure by B to take reasonable care for his own safety. The judge and Court of Appeal held that C was jointly and severally liable with the first employer, but subject to a 20 per cent reduction for B&#8217;s contributory negligence while he was self-employed. In the second case the respondent (P), who had died of mesothelioma, had been during his working life regularly exposed to asbestos in breach of duty by four employers, although the periods of exposure were of different lengths. In the third case the respondent (M) had been exposed to asbestos in shipyards by a number of employers. In the cases of P and M the judges and Court of Appeal followed the decision in B&#8217;s case in holding that the solvent employers were jointly and severally liable for the full damage. C submitted that it should not be liable at all as a matter of causation, since there had been a period when B and no one else had been responsible for his exposure to asbestos dust; and the appellants submitted, amongst other things, that they should be severally liable only according to the share of the risk created by their breach of duty.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeals (Lord Rodger of Earlsferry dissenting on the issue of apportionment), that (1) as an exception to the usual rule of causation, a worker who had contracted mesothelioma after being wrongfully exposed to asbestos at different times by more than one employer or occupier could sue any of them notwithstanding that he could not prove which exposure had caused the disease, Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd (t/a GH Dovener &amp; Son) [2002] UKHL 22, [2003] 1 A.C. 32 applied. The Fairchild exception could operate even though not all the potential causes of damage were tortious, and a non-tortious source of risk did not have to have been created by someone who was also a tortfeasor, McGhee v National Coal Board [1973] 1 W.L.R. 1 considered. However it was an essential condition for the operation of the exception that the impossibility of proving that the defendant caused the damage arose out of the existence of another potential causative agent that operated in the same way, Wilsher v Essex AHA [1988] A.C. 1074 distinguished. (2) The decision of the majority in Fairchild proceeded on the basis that the creation of a material risk of mesothelioma was sufficient for liability. If the basis of liability was the wrongful creation of a risk or chance of causing the disease, the damage that the defendant should be regarded as having caused was the creation of such a risk or chance. If that was the right way to characterise the damage, then it did not matter that the disease as such would be indivisible damage, Associated Newspapers Ltd v Dingle [1961] 2 Q.B. 162 distinguished. Treating the creation of the risk as the damage caused by the defendant involved quantifying the likelihood that the damage that was known to have materialised was caused by that particular defendant. It would then be possible to determine the share of the damage that should be attributed to him. The attribution of liability according to the relative degree of contribution to the chance of the disease being contracted would also be fair. On that approach questions of contributory negligence and contribution would not normally arise. The instant cases would be remitted to redetermine the damages by reference to the proportion of the risk attributable to the breaches of duty by the appellants.</div></div> </div>

Accordingly, in cases of both single and multiple defendants, a claimant would succeed if he proved, on the balance of probability, that a defendant&#8217;s breach of duty had materially increased the risk that he would develop the disease and there was no need for him to show that the breach had doubled the risk.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeals dismissed.<p>(1) The Compensation Act 2006 s.3 had grafted a special rule onto the principle in Fairchild and Barker that applied only to mesothelioma. That had draconian consequences for an employer who had been responsible for only a small proportion of the overall exposure of a claimant to asbestos dust. However, it would be wrong to have regard to those consequences because that position had been laid down by Parliament. Section 3 applied where the responsible person was liable in tort for materially increasing the risk of a victim contracting mesothelioma. Whether and in what circumstances liability in tort attached to one who had materially increased the risk of a victim contracting mesothelioma remained a question of common law which was capable of further development. The rule in Fairchild and Barker had been adopted to cater for the ignorance that had existed at the time of those decisions about the causes of mesothelioma. Section 3 therefore did not preclude the courts from reverting to the conventional approach of balance of probabilities should advances in medical science in relation to the disease make such a step appropriate (see paras 58, 70, 142 of judgment). (2) Knowledge about mesothelioma was based partly on medical science and partly on statistical analysis or epidemiology. Uncertainty about the biological cause of the disease made it impossible for a claimant to prove causation according to the conventional &#8220;but for&#8221; test and that was why the special rules of causation in Fairchild and Barker had been devised. There were special features and knowledge gaps in relation to mesothelioma which meant that it was inappropriate to decide causation on epidemiological data relating incidence to exposure. The &#8220;double the risk&#8221; test was therefore not appropriate in cases of single or multiple defendants and the adoption of the special rule of causation set out in Fairchild and Barker was justified in cases where there was one defendant. Even if it was possible to postulate with confidence that the extent of a defendant&#8217;s contribution to a victim&#8217;s exposure to asbestos precisely reflected the likelihood that his breach of duty had caused the victim&#8217;s disease, there would still be justification for the application of the Fairchild rule where all the exposure was wrongful, Fairchild and Barker followed (paras 11, 19-20, 97-106, 113, 160-162). (3) Liability for mesothelioma fell on anyone who had materially increased the risk of the victim contracting the disease. The insertion of the word &#8220;material&#8221; was intended to exclude an increase of risk that was so insignificant that the court would properly disregard it on the de minimis principle. There was no justification for adopting the &#8220;double the risk&#8221; test as the benchmark of what constituted a material increase of risk. What was de minimis was a question for the judge on the facts of any particular case. In the case of mesothelioma, a stage had to be reached at which, even allowing for the possibility that exposure to asbestos could have a cumulative effect, a particular exposure was too insignificant to be taken into account, having regard to the overall exposure that had taken place (paras 107-108).</p></div></div> </div>

On leaving the flat his wife and brother-in-law secured the door but he set off down the steep stairs with his small daughter; the stairs had no handrail.

A notice giving 13 months&#8217; notice and placing the member on garden leave had breached the agreement and the member had not affirmed the agreement. The doctrine of repudiatory breach did not apply where there was a multi-party agreement governing the rights and duties of members within the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 s.5.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Judgment accordingly.<p>(1) There was no ambiguity in the language of the agreement and side letter; the notice period was precisely six months. Even if there had been ambiguity, commercial common sense considerations meant that it had been reasonable to stipulate a fixed period, Arnold v Britton [2015] UKSC 36, [2015] A.C. 1619 applied (see paras 136-137, 139 of judgment). (2) The provisions could not reasonably be construed as permitting service of a premature notice which by effluxion of time might mature into a valid notice (para.144). (3) Giving effect to all the words in the agreement, there was a dual condition requiring a decision by LIS to require a member to retire, then consideration by the management committee as a reserved matter. That construction accorded with business common sense (para.153). (4) Service of a valid termination notice was a condition precedent to any exercise of the power to place a member on garden leave, which was conferred on the committee not LIS (para.157). (5) P had a right and duty to play a full role in the LLP&#8217;s business for at least the first 18 months of his initial term. His complete exclusion without prior warning had left him wholly unable to fulfill his role as an active member and was a breach of contract (paras 173-174, 181). (6) A reasonable person in P&#8217;s position would have concluded that the LLP had decided to terminate his active involvement in its affairs with immediate effect, and was prepared to disregard the clear provisions of the agreement where they conflicted with that aim, Eminence Property Developments Ltd v Heaney [2010] EWCA Civ 1168, [2011] 2 All E.R. (Comm) 223 applied. Those matters went to the root of the contract and amounted to immediate renunciation of the agreement (para.197). (7) It would not be right to treat P as having unequivocally elected to affirm the agreement merely because he continued to accept monthly payments. He had taken no positive steps to procure their continuation, and his continued acceptance of them was broadly consistent with his contention that he remained a member of the LLP (para.216). (8) The doctrine of repudiatory breach was excluded in relation to multi-party s.5 agreements. Once a s.5 agreement had been made, it was binding until terminated by agreement, or varied in accordance with an agreed procedure. Only in such circumstances could there be &#8220;an absence of agreement as to any matter&#8221; within the meaning of s.5(1)(b) in relation to a matter previously covered by a s.5 agreement, so as to allow the matter to be governed by the default rules. Only in that way could the possibility of mutually inconsistent rules applying to the same subject matter be avoided. It would be offensive to common sense, and contrary to the parties&#8217; reasonable commercial expectations, if the doctrine permitted P to share in the LLP&#8217;s capital profits when the agreement entitled him to a fixed income not capital. Accordingly, P&#8217;s purported acceptance of the repudiatory breach was of no legal effect and his relationship with the LLP continued to be governed by the agreement (paras 235, 237-241, 243-244). (9) P was entitled to damages for breach of contract, but it was difficult to see how he could have suffered any substantial loss beyond the non-payment of his fixed income. There was no basis for implying a term that the fund was to be marketed and promoted (paras 244, 247).</p></div></div> </div>

The employee&#8217;s contributory conduct towards the second accident had been below the standard of unreasonableness required to break the chain of causation following McKew v Holland &amp; Hannen &amp; Cubitts (Scotland) Ltd [1969] 3 All E.R. 1621.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>The formulation in McKew was problematic in that &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; covered a wide range of meanings, McKew considered. The word&#8217;s purpose in the instant context was to determine the point at which the law regarded a consequence as being too remote; that could help find its correct meaning. Although remoteness had been explained in terms of foreseeability in the past, that was problematic; if anything, it was foreseeability that had to be explained in terms of remoteness, Simmons v British Steel Plc [2004] UKHL 20, 2004 S.C. (H.L.) 94 considered. The rationale of the principle that an intervening event broke the chain of causation was fairness, Corr v IBC Vehicles Ltd [2008] UKHL 13, [2008] 1 A.C. 884 applied, and the question of remoteness involved a value judgment, Kuwait Airways Corp v Iraqi Airways Co (No.6) [2002] UKHL 19, [2002] 2 A.C. 883 applied. The degree of unreasonable conduct required by the McKew test was very high, Emeh v Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster AHA [1985] Q.B. 1012 applied. However, it was unhelpful to describe the later conduct required by the test as reckless or deliberate. The judge had found that S&#8217;s conduct had fallen far below McKew unreasonableness, and there was no good reason to go behind his judgment. If he had found S principally to blame, the case might have been closer to McKew . The apportionment of blame spoke clearly against a finding either that S had acted recklessly or that it was unfair to treat the chain of causation as surviving the second accident. Like the amputation, the second accident had been an unexpected but real consequence of the first accident, albeit one to which S&#8217;s own misjudgement had contributed.</p></div></div> </div>

The judge had found that the police officers present had owed a duty to L, as a known suicide risk, to take reasonable care to prevent him committing suicide whilst in custody, and that the officers had been negligent in leaving open the hatch of L&#8217;s cell door, as it was reasonably foreseeable that he would take the opportunity to tie his shirt to it and thus strangle himself. The judge held that the duty of care had been breached but a causative link had not been established between the officers&#8217; negligence and L&#8217;s death because the defences of volenti non fit injuria and novus actus interveniens applied and he assessed L&#8217;s contributory negligence at 100 per cent. That decision was reversed on appeal ([1999] Q.B. 169, [1997] C.L.Y. 3817), where it was held that the defences could not be relied upon where the intervening act contended for was the very same act that the defendant had a duty to prevent and damages of GBP 8,690 were awarded in full. The Commissioner appealed.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal (Lord Hobhouse dissenting on causation), that the amount of damages was reduced. A deliberate act of suicide was not a novus actus interveniens negating the causal connection between the breach of duty and the death. To hold as such would lead to the absurd result that the very act which the duty sought to prevent would be fatal to establishing a causative link. Although persons of sound mind were generally taken to be responsible for their own actions, in rare situations a duty could be owed to such persons to prevent them from self harm. That had occurred in the instant case, owing to the complete control that the police exercised over prisoners in custody and the stresses inherent in the custodial situation. The duty represented an exception to the rule that a deliberate act by a person of sound mind taking advantage of the defendant&#8217;s negligent act would destroy the causative link. Furthermore, the principle of human autonomy was not destroyed by the acts of police officers in ensuring that the prisoner&#8217;s environment was monitored to prevent suicide attempts. However, on the issue of causation, both the police, who had been negligent in leaving the hatch open, and L, who had responsibility for his own life, were the causes of L&#8217;s death. L was held contributorily negligent and damages were reduced by 50 per cent to apportion fault equally.</div></div> </div>

A claimant who had committed manslaughter as a result of psychological problems caused by the negligence of a third party was therefore precluded from recovering from that third party general damages and loss of earnings flowing from his crime.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed, cross-appeal dismissed.<p>(1) The narrow expression of the rule, that a person could not recover for damage that was the consequence of a sentence imposed on him for a criminal act was well-established, Clunis applied. The Court of Appeal had been right to hold that it was bound by Clunis to reject G&#8217;s claim for damages suffered in consequence of the sentence of detention. However, it had not been right to go on to hold, despite its finding that the rule applied, that G was entitled to compensation for loss of earnings after his arrest. He had been unable to earn because he was detained after having committed manslaughter. While it was true that even if he had not committed manslaughter, his earning capacity would still have been impaired by the PTSD, liability was precluded by the decision in Jobling v Associated Dairies [1982] A.C. 794, Jobling followed. G&#8217;s claim for loss of earnings after his arrest and his claim for general damages were claims for damage caused by the lawful sentence imposed upon him for manslaughter. They fell within the narrower version of the rule and were not recoverable. (2) Neither the claim for general damages for feelings of guilt and remorse consequent upon the killing nor the claim for an indemnity against any claims which might be brought by dependants of the dead pedestrian was a consequence of the sentence of the criminal court. However, the wider version of the rule, applied by the judge at first instance, covered those heads of damage. G&#8217;s liability to compensate the dependants of the dead pedestrian was an immediate, inextricable consequence of his having intentionally killed him. The same was true of his feelings of guilt and remorse. The judge at first instance was therefore right and his judgment was restored. (3) (Per Lord Phillips) It was not necessarily right to make no distinction between a sentence of imprisonment and a hospital order. While a conviction for an offence punishable with imprisonment was necessary to confer jurisdiction for the imposition of a hospital order, the offence leading to that conviction might have no relevance to the decision to make the order. Where the sentencing judge made it clear that the defendant&#8217;s offending behaviour played no part in the decision to impose the hospital order, it was strongly arguable that the order should be treated as being a consequence of the defendant&#8217;s mental condition and not of his criminal act. In that event ex turpi causa would not apply.</p></div></div> </div>

Its breach caused D injury of both kinds. While D was not, at the time of his death, insane in M&#8217;Naghten terms, nor was he fully responsible. He acted in a way which he would not have done but for the injury from which V&#8217;s breach caused him to suffer. That being so, his conduct in taking his own life could not be said to fall outside the scope of the duty which V owed him. (2) Depression, possibly very severe, was a foreseeable consequence of V&#8217;s breach. It was not incumbent on C to show that suicide itself was foreseeable. A tortfeasor who reasonably foresaw the occurrence of some damage need not foresee the precise form which the damage might take, Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] A.C. 837 applied. Some manifestations of severe depression could properly be held to be so unusual and unpredictable as to be outside the bounds of what was reasonably foreseeable, but suicide could not be so regarded. It was not a usual manifestation, but it was not uncommon. Further, in the circumstances suicide was reasonably foreseeable by V, considering the possible effect of such an accident on a hypothetical employee. (3) Suicide could be a novus actus if a person took his own life as a conscious decision in the absence of any disabling mental illness, Wright v Davidson (1992) 88 DLR (4th) 698 considered. However, D&#8217;s suicide was not a voluntary, informed decision taken by him as an adult of sound mind making and giving effect to a personal decision about his future. It was the response of a man suffering from a severely depressive illness which impaired his capacity to make reasoned and informed judgments about his future, such illness being a consequence of V&#8217;s tort. It was not unfair to hold V responsible for that consequence of its breach of duty. In order for C to be able to recover, it was not necessary to show that D was insane in M&#8217;Naghten terms. (4) Since the suicide was not a novus actus it was impossible to hold that the damages attributable to the death were rendered too remote because the deceased&#8217;s conduct was unreasonable. (5) D had not consented to the accident and injury which befell him. Nor did he consent to his suicide which was the result of a psychological condition induced by V&#8217;s breach of duty. (6) It was not appropriate for the court to decide the contributory negligence issue on which the courts below had made no findings. (Per Lords Scott, Mance and Neuberger) A deduction for contributory negligence could be appropriate in circumstances of deliberate suicide committed in a state of depression induced by an accident, Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2000] 1 A.C. 360 considered.</p></div></div> </div>

The injury was due to the negligence of the defendants, the husband&#8217;s employers.

In an action by the plaintiff against the defendants under the Fatal Accidents Acts 1846-1908, and the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934, held that as the defendants could have foreseen injury by burning they were liable in damages for the resulting death.

Except for the broken finger, the injuries would probably have been prevented by the wearing of a seat belt. The plaintiff stated in evidence that he did not like wearing the belt because of the danger of being trapped in the vehicle after the crash and because he did not drive at more than normal speed. Nield J. had held that the omission to wear the seat belt did not amount to contributory negligence upon the basis, inter alia, that to find otherwise would constitute an unjustified invasion of the freedom of choice of the motorist; if he was wrong, he would have reduced the damages by twenty per cent.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>A reduction of twenty per cent would be made. It was held that that the prudent man should guard against the possibility of negligence by others by wearing a seat belt; that the chances of injury are four times as great when a seat belt is not worn; that in determining whether contributory negligence is made out the proper question is not what or who caused the accident but what was the cause of the damage.

R had died of lung cancer at the age of 63. He had previously been employed by the MOD as a boiler maker, during the course of which employment he was exposed to asbestos fibres, which were causative of the lung cancer that killed him. R had smoked for the majority of his life, which was also causative of his cancer. R had received numerous warnings about the damage that his continued smoking was causing to his health and the government had issued the first health warnings about smoking in the 1970s. Despite the warnings that he received he did not stop smoking. The MOD admitted primary liability for B&#8217;s claim. The MOD submitted that B&#8217;s claim should be reduced by 25 per cent on account of R&#8217;s contributory negligence, as he had continued to smoke when he knew or should have known that in doing so he was liable to damage his health.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; assessing damages, that R&#8217;s continued smoking constituted contributory negligence. When the first health warnings were put on cigarette packets, it was reasonably foreseeable by a reasonably prudent man that if he smoked he risked damaging his health. In addition, R had been specifically advised about the damaging effects of smoking on his health. He had been advised to stop smoking on numerous occasions. However, R could not be criticised for starting to smoke. When he began smoking the connection between smoking and serious ill health was not widely accepted. R&#8217;s fault was in failing to give up smoking. There was no evidence that R was so addicted to tobacco that he could not reasonably have been expected to have stopped smoking: R could have given up smoking. R had been guilty of a fault that was partly responsible for his death. A reasonably prudent man, warned that there was a substantial risk that smoking would seriously damage his health, would stop smoking, Froom v Butcher [1976] Q.B. 286, Jones v Livox Quarries Ltd [1952] 2 Q.B. 608 and Stapley v Gypsum Mines Ltd [1953] A.C. 663 considered. The principle of contributory negligence was that a person had responsibility for his actions. The reduction in damages that was just and equitable had to take account of the relative blameworthiness of the parties&#8217; conduct, Boothman v British Northrop (1972) 13 K.I.R. 112 and O&#8217;Connell v Jackson [1972] 1 Q.B. 270 applied. The MOD accepted that it was guilty of breaches of statutory duty at a time when the dangers of asbestos were known. Therefore, R&#8217;s contributory negligence was less than 50 per cent. The contribution to his combined risk of his continued smoking when he should have stopped was in the region of a half of his ultimate risk. The appropriate reduction in damages attributable to R&#8217;s continued smoking after he should have stopped was 20 per cent and the damages recoverable by B were reduced by that amount.</div></div> </div>

C was only entitled to assert that P was contributorily negligent so that any damages to which she was entitled had to be reduced if, at common law, there was a defence of contributory negligence to a claim against a defendant for damages for the torts of assault or battery. There was no case before the Act which held that there was such a defence in the case of an intentional tort such as assault and battery. Insofar as there were cases since the Act that suggested that it could be used to reduce damages awarded for the torts of assault or battery in a case where it was found that the claimant was contributorily negligent, they were unsatisfactory and could not stand with statements of principle made in two subsequent House of Lords decisions, Lane v Holloway [1968] 1 Q.B. 379 and Murphy v Culhane [1977] Q.B. 94 considered, Reeves v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2000] 1 A.C. 360 and Standard Chartered Bank followed. As a matter of law, therefore, C could not rely on contributory negligence to defeat P&#8217;s claim or to reduce the damages otherwise to be awarded to her (see paras 31, 48-49, 61-63 of judgment). (2) The judge was not entitled to reach the conclusion that he had as to the cause of P&#8217;s agoraphobia. Having rejected entirely the evidence of B and generally accepted X&#8217;s evidence, he had to have given a good reason to reject a particular view of X on the effect of the assault on the psychiatric condition of P, given her medical history to date. He had not done so. The judge should have accepted X&#8217;s opinion and concluded that the effect of the assault was to accelerate a psychiatric state, including agoraphobia, that P would have reached in any event. The damages awarded had, accordingly, to be reduced (paras 72-74).</p><p></p></div></div> </div>

[1985] A.C. 168, could not be supported. The Supreme Court re-stated the principles concerning the liability of accessories or secondary parties.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeals allowed.<p>The Chan Wing Siu principle could not be supported. The introduction of the principle was based on an incomplete, and in some respects erroneous, reading of the previous case law, coupled with generalised and questionable policy arguments. Reversing a statement of principle which had been made and followed by the Privy Council and the House of Lords on a number of occasions was a big step, but it was right to do so for several reasons. First, the court had had the benefit of a much fuller analysis than on previous occasions when the topic was considered. Second, it could not be said that the law was now well established and working satisfactorily; it remained highly controversial and a continuing source of difficulty for trial judges. Third, secondary liability was an important part of the common law, and if a wrong turn had been taken, it should be corrected. Fourth, in the common law foresight of what might happen was ordinarily no more than evidence from which a jury could infer the presence of a requisite intention. It might be strong evidence, but its adoption as a test for the mental element for murder in the case of a secondary party was a serious and anomalous departure from the basic rule, which resulted in an over-extension of the law of murder and a reduction of the law of manslaughter. Murder already had a relatively low mens rea threshold, as it included an intention to cause serious injury, without intent to kill or to cause risk to life. The Chan Wing Siu principle extended liability for murder to a secondary party on the basis of a still lesser degree of culpability, namely foresight only of the possibility that the principal might commit murder but without there being any need for an intention to assist him to do so. Fifth, the rule had the striking anomaly of requiring a lower mental threshold for guilt in the case of the accessory than in the case of the principal, Chan Wing Siu disapproved. It would not be satisfactory for the court simply to disapprove the Chan Wing Siu principle. Those concerned with criminal justice, including members of the public, were entitled to expect a clear statement of the relevant principles. The proper course was to re-state the principles which had been established over many years before the law took a wrong turn. The error was to equate foresight with intent to assist, as a matter of law; the correct approach was to treat foresight as evidence of intent. The long-standing practice, before Chan Wing Siu , of inferring intent to assist from a common criminal purpose which included the further crime, if the occasion for it were to arise, was always a legitimate one; what was illegitimate was to treat foresight as an inevitable yardstick of common purpose. The court proceeded to re-state the relevant principles. It also addressed the potential impact of the instant decision on past convictions (see paras 79-84, 87-100 of judgment).</p></div></div> </div>

The act of escaping from custody was a criminal offence at common law but did not give rise to any liability in tort, National Coal Board v England [1954] A.C. 403 considered. Moreover, the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 did not apply in circumstances where a claimant&#8217;s action constituted a common law crime which did not give rise to tortious liability. V&#8217;s criminal conduct had been sufficiently serious to merit the application of the principle of ex turpi causa.

There was no doubt that S was the persona of R and it was common ground that he was the directing mind and will of the corporation. (2) The &#8220;sole actor&#8221; exception applied so as to disapply the Hampshire Land principle, Hampshire Land considered. S&#8217;s fraudulent conduct was to be treated as the conduct of R, and the principle of ex turpi causa defeated R&#8217;s claim. In the case of a &#8220;one-man company&#8221; that had deliberately engaged in serious fraud, awareness of that fraud was to be imputed to the company, Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan [1995] 2 A.C. 378 considered. In particular, the &#8220;sole actor&#8221; principle was to be applied to a claim made by a company in liquidation against its former auditors where the company was a one-man company engaged in fraud and where the auditors were accused of negligence in failing to call a halt to that fraud. R&#8217;s submission that a claim against auditors was a context in which it should not be treated as primarily liable for its fraud could not be accepted. On the assumption that M did owe a duty of care to R, it was a duty to the company as a whole and not to individual shareholders or creditors. If the only human embodiment of the company already knew about its fraudulent activities there was realistically no protection that its auditors could give it. Moreover, if the company was primarily liable because of the sole actor rule there was no innocent participator within the company who did not share the guilty knowledge. Therefore, one or more individuals who for fraudulent purposes ran a one-man company could not obtain an advantage by claiming that the company was not a fraudster but a secondary victim. (3) In arguing that ex turpi causa did not provide a defence where the claimant&#8217;s illegal conduct was the very thing that the defendant was under a duty to prevent, R was relying on a principle of causation. A principle of causation could not trump ex turpi causa where that latter principle applied, however short of merits the defendant might be. (4) R had also argued that the public policy defence ought not to bar claims brought by a company in insolvent liquidation where the creditors were innocent parties who had been defrauded by S. If that were right it would create a large gap in the public policy defence. Moreover, had S carried out his frauds directly, neither he nor his trustee in bankruptcy could have resisted the public policy defence. There was no good reason to apply a different rule to a company in liquidation. Apart from special statutory claims in respect of misfeasance, wrong trading and so on, it could not assert any cause of action which it could not have asserted before the commencement of its liquidation, and that was especially true in the context of the duties of an auditor, which were not owed to a company&#8217;s creditors. (5) (Per Lord Phillips) The essential issue was whether, in applying ex turpi causa to the instant case, one should look behind the company at those whose interests the relevant duty was intended to protect. Those for whose benefit the claim was brought fell outside the scope of any duty owed by M. The sole person for whose benefit such duty was owed was S, who was responsible for the fraud. In those circumstances ex turpi causa provided a defence to the claim. (6) The reasoning of the majority had the effect of relieving from all responsibility auditors who had negligently failed in their duty to check and report on the activities of one-man companies operating Ponzi schemes. That was questionable policy and it was not required by the law.</p></div></div> </div>

He had therefore proceeded on a correct factual basis when considering ex turpi causa and the MIB Agreement issue (see paras 62-63, 72 of judgment). (2) The judge had been wrong to uphold the ex turpi causa defence. The damage suffered by D had not been caused by his, or his and P&#8217;s, criminal activity. It had been caused by P&#8217;s tortious act in the negligent way in which he drove his car. In those circumstances the illegal acts were incidental and D was entitled to recover his loss from P, Gray v Thames Trains Ltd [2009] UKHL 33, [2009] 1 A.C. 1339 and Pitts v Hunt [1991] 1 Q.B. 24 followed (paras 37, 64, 73). (3) Although the MIB Agreement was intended to give effect to Directive 2009/103, the Directive gave only limited assistance in the interpretation of cl.6(1)(e) as it contained nothing corresponding to the clause. The most that could be derived was that a restrictive interpretation of the clause was required by the fact that it was an exclusion from the general principle of compensation set out in the Directive. It was obvious on the facts that the vehicle was being used in the furtherance and in the course of a crime within the meaning of the clause. &#8220;Crime&#8221; could not be read as being restricted to &#8220;serious crime&#8221;; that would leave the clause with little practical purpose. In any event, possession of a commercial quantity of cannabis with intent to supply was a serious crime to which the clause applied; given the finding that the very purpose of the journey had been the transportation of the drugs, the situation fell squarely within the wording of the clause. Use of the vehicle did not have to constitute an ingredient of the offence for the exclusion to apply; in any event, the vehicle had been an essential element in the crime, as D and P would not have wanted to carry so large a packet of drugs on public transport (paras 67-68, 77). (4) (Per Ward L.J.) The MIB Agreement had to be construed restrictively as it was an exception to the purpose of the Directive. Clause 6(1)(e)(iii) could not mean that compensation was excluded if the vehicle was being used for any crime, as that could be disproportionate; &#8220;crime&#8221; had to mean serious crime. The crime in the instant case had not been heinous enough to be the kind of crime covered by the clause (paras 48-51).</p></div></div> </div>

The test for determining liability had focused on causation, whereas the principle developed in joint enterprise cases had focused on the existence of a duty of care. However, the same causation principle should apply whether the criminal was acting alone or as part of a joint enterprise, Delaney v Pickett [2011] EWCA Civ 1532, [2012] 1 W.L.R. 2149 applied. When applying the causation principle developed in Gray v Thames Trains Ltd [2009] UKHL 33, [2009] 1 A.C. 1339, the courts should recognise the wider public policy considerations which had led them to deny joint liability in joint enterprise cases. The earlier authorities on joint enterprise provided valuable assistance in answering the question as to when the claimant&#8217;s injury would be treated as having been caused by his own conduct, notwithstanding that the immediate cause was the act of a partner in crime. They reflected what seemed to be the underlying policy, even if the rationale for denying liability had to be cast in terms of causation rather than duty. The injury would be caused by, rather than occasioned by, the criminal activity of the claimant where the joint criminal illegality affected the standard of care the claimant was reasonably entitled to expect from his partner in crime, Ashton v Turner [1981] Q.B. 137 and Pitts v Hunt [1991] 1 Q.B. 24 applied. The principle was to be formulated as: where the character of the joint criminal enterprise was such that it was foreseeable that a party or parties could be subject to unusual or increased risks of harm as a consequence of the activities of the parties in pursuance of their criminal activities, and the risk materialised, the injury could properly be said to be caused by the criminal act of the claimant even if it resulted from the negligent or intentional act of another party to the illegal enterprise, Gray applied. That did not necessarily exhaust situations where the ex turpi causa principle would apply in joint enterprise cases, but would cater for the overwhelming majority of cases (see paras 21-29 of judgment). (2) In the instant case, the judge had been entitled to conclude that although the damage might not have occurred but for O&#8217;s negligent driving, it was caused by the criminal activity in which J was engaged. The injury resulted from his personal conduct in placing himself in such a dangerous position, and because he had accepted the heightened risk of O&#8217;s dangerous driving and that risk had materialised, Gray applied. Active encouragement would not be necessary in all cases; it would be enough that the claimant and negligent driver were involved in the criminal enterprise together, and that the accident had arisen from activity which it could be foreseen might be committed in the course of that enterprise. Active encouragement could constitute the evidence of joint enterprise which would otherwise be lacking, but in the instant case the evidence of joint enterprise and of the implicit encouragement to bad driving was plain even in the absence of active encouragement (paras 46-48). (3) As the doctrine was one of public policy, there should be some flexibility in its operation. It would not apply, for example, to minor traffic offences. In most joint criminal liability cases, the nature and characteristics of the principal offence would in practice determine which acts of a co-conspirator would attract the application of the doctrine, and for relatively trivial offences the range of such acts was likely to be very limited. Nonetheless, there could be a problem in determining in certain cases whether the offences attracted the application of the doctrine. However, wherever the precise line was to be drawn, the theft of the ladders in the instant case clearly fell on the side where the doctrine applied. Theft was not merely an imprisonable offence, it carried a maximum sentence of seven years. It was also not a strict liability offence which could be committed without any real moral culpability (paras 49-52).</p></div></div> </div>

The defendant&#8217;s car driven by him but out of control crashed into the others, killing the husband and injuring most of the children.

P had all suffered post traumatic stress disorder as a result of their involvement in the aftermath of the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster in which many spectators had been killed and injured. The Chief Constable admitted that the disaster had been caused by police negligence in allowing overcrowding to occur, but disputed P&#8217;s entitlement to recover damages in tort for the psychiatric injury they had suffered. P contended that justice demanded that they be compensated for the harm they had suffered as a result of a tort and that there was no justification for treating physical and psychiatric injury as different kinds of damage. P further argued that they were entitled to recover damages either on the basis of an employer&#8217;s duty to protect employees from harm through work or by virtue of their status as rescuers.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, (Lord Goff dissenting and Lord Griffiths dissenting in part) that a chief constable owed officers under him a duty analogous to that of an employer to care for the safety of employees and to take reasonable steps to protect them from physical harm, but there was no extension of that duty to protect from psychiatric injury where there was no breach of the duty to protect from physical injury. As a result, the employment relationship did not create a liability on the Chief Constable for psychiatric injury sustained by P who had not been involved in the disaster as rescuers and it was not possible to classify P as primary victims, since none of them were at any time exposed to personal danger nor reasonably believed themselves to be so, Page v Smith [1996] A.C. 155 considered. Recognition of P&#8217;s claims would significantly widen the established categories of cases for which damages could be recovered for pure psychiatric harm and to allow the claims would not fit easily with the decision in Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1992] 1 A.C. 310 to deny compensation to bereaved relatives of victims of the disaster who had not witnessed events at first hand or acted as rescuers. The fact that P&#8217;s injuries were sustained in the course of discharging their duties as police officers did not of itself justify extending the law so as to allow their claims.</div></div> </div>

There was no arguable case that publication of the book would constitute the requisite conduct element of the tort or that the father had the requisite mental element.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>In Wilkinson v Downton , Wright J. recognised that wilful infringement of the right to personal safety was a tort. It had three elements: a conduct element, a mental element and a consequence element. The issues in this case related to the first and second elements. The conduct element required words or conduct directed towards the claimant for which there was no justification or reasonable excuse. The Court of Appeal treated the publication of the book as conduct directed towards O and considered that the question of justification had therefore to be judged vis-a-vis him. That was wrong. The book was for a wide audience and the question of justification had to be considered accordingly, not in relation to O in isolation. There was every justification for the publication. A person who had suffered in the way that R had, and had struggled to cope with the consequences of his suffering in the way that he had, had the right to tell the world about it. And there was a corresponding public interest in others being able to listen to his life story in all its searing detail. Of course vulnerable children had to be protected as far as reasonably practicable from exposure to material which would harm them, but the right way of doing so was not to expand Wilkinson v Downton to ban the publication of a work of general interest. Freedom to report the truth was a basic right to which the law gave a very high level of protection. It was difficult to envisage any circumstances in which speech which was not deceptive, threatening or possibly abusive could give rise to liability in tort for wilful infringement of another&#8217;s right to personal safety. The right to report the truth was justification in itself. As to the mental element, the Court of Appeal found that the necessary intention could be imputed to R. There was a critical difference between imputing the existence of an intention as a matter of law and inferring the existence of an intention as a matter of fact. The former was a vestige of a previous age and had no proper role in the modern law of tort. The abolition of imputed intent cleared the way to proper consideration of two important questions about the mental element of the tort. The first was whether, where a recognised psychiatric illness was the product of severe mental or emotional distress, it was necessary that the defendant should have intended to cause illness or whether it was sufficient that he intended to cause severe distress which in fact resulted in recognisable illness. The second was whether recklessness was sufficient. The answer to the first question was to choose the second option. Recklessness should not be included in the definition of the mental element. To hold that the necessary mental element was intention to cause physical harm or severe mental or emotional distress struck a just balance. It meant that a person who actually intended to cause another to suffer severe mental or emotional distress bore the risk of legal liability if the deliberately inflicted severe distress caused the other to suffer a recognised psychiatric illness. It would be possible to limit liability for the tort to cases in which the defendant&#8217;s conduct was &#8220;extreme, flagrant or outrageous&#8221;, as in Canada. That argument had not so far been advanced in this country. The instant court was inclined to the view, which was necessarily obiter, that the tort was sufficiently contained by the combination of (a) the conduct element requiring words or conduct directed at the claimant for which there was no justification or excuse, (b) the mental element requiring an intention to cause at least severe mental or emotional distress, and (c) the consequence element requiring physical harm or recognised psychiatric illness. In this case, there was no basis for supposing that R had an actual intention to cause psychiatric harm or severe mental or emotional distress to O. There was no arguable case that publication of the book would constitute the requisite conduct element of the tort or that R had the requisite mental element, Wilkinson v Downton considered (see paras 73-77, 80-84, 87-90 of judgment).</p></div></div> </div>

W brought claims against ECC for damages for psychiatric injury suffered upon learning of the abuse to their children and originating from a sense of responsibility for G&#8217;s actions. They alleged that ECC was in breach of its duty of care in placing G with them contrary to their express wishes. The judge at first instance struck out W&#8217;s claim and W&#8217;s appeal was dismissed ([1999] Fam. 90) on the grounds that the claims were unarguable and therefore had no prospect of success. W appealed.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that (1) on the facts alleged, regardless of whether they were ultimately found to be right or wrong, it was impossible to say that the claim would so clearly not succeed that it ought not to be pursued to trial.

The categorisation of those claiming to be included as either primary or secondary victims was not conclusive. It depended on the facts of each case and there was insufficient information at this stage to rule that these circumstances were outside the range of psychiatric injury currently recognised by the law. The pleadings indicated that the injury was more than &#8220;acute grief&#8221; but a detailed investigation of the facts was required to ascertain whether the necessary temporal and spatial limitations were satisfied, White v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1999] 2 A.C. 455 considered.</div></div> </div>

The distinction between the arrangements as made by the operator and others&#8217; perception of the arrangements was artificial and unrealistic. The judge had been entitled to find that the understandings of the investors had conformed to what was intended by the operator. He had not been required to give special weight to documents without regard to their context. The judge had concluded that arrangements within s.235 had been made when plots were marketed and investors paid their deposits, the object of the arrangements being that the company should achieve a sale of the site after seeking to enhance its value by improving the prospects for housing development, the price to be shared between the owners. That conclusion was amply supported by the evidence and disclosed no error of law (see paras 54-55, 92 of judgment).</p><p>(2) The &#8220;property&#8221; for the purposes of s.235(1) was each of the company&#8217;s sites taken as a whole, not the individual plots. The distinction between the &#8220;property&#8221; being the site and it being the aggregate of the plots was not one of substance. The property for the purposes of s.235(1) was the whole site. That definition remained the same in principle throughout the section. However, management control under s.235(2) and s.235(3) could be achieved in different ways. It was necessary to consider the mechanisms by which the participants on the one hand or the operator on the other managed, or had management control of, the property. &#8220;Control&#8221; within s.235(2) was not confined to legal control; it had to refer to the reality of how the arrangements were to be operated, which could or could not involve rights or powers enforceable in law, Sky Land Consultants Plc, Re [2010] EWHC 399 (Ch) applied. The judge had found that the facts of the instant case meant that in substance each investor got rights under a scheme that provided for someone else to manage the property. He had clearly been entitled to do so. The management of the property had comprised the steps necessary to obtain planning permission and secure a sale. The investors had no part in or control over those activities. Even if attention was directed to the rights attached to individual units, there was no parallel with individual lessees in a block of flats. They had control over the management of both their own flats and the common parts. The investors&#8217; ownership of the individual units was not linked to any exercise of management control. Control of the management activities for the property as a whole had been with the company. Although its control had not been underpinned by legal rights over the units, that did not affect the substance of the arrangements (paras 56-63, 93, 96-102). The judge had considered that s.235(2) required that investors had not actually exercised control. &#8220;Control&#8221; of property meant the ability to decide what was to happen to it. Either the arrangements conferred control on the investors or they did not. That was necessarily to be viewed from the time the arrangements were made. The test could not depend on what happened afterwards. The question was in whom control would be vested were control to be required, Brown v InnovatorOne Plc [2012] EWHC 1321 (Comm) doubted (para.94).</p></div></div> </div>

(2) The judge had found that, if he were to disregard T&#8217;s willingness to engage in negotiations on a one property basis and if he were to look at the matter as if there were no Part 36 payment, he would have awarded S two-thirds to three-quarters of his costs. In so finding the judge must have been of the view that the running of a case in relation to external funds being available so as to be able to buy two properties merited a discount of one-quarter or one-third of the costs that S as the successful party would have been entitled to absent any payment in. He had then reduced any award down to nil on the basis that S&#8217;s failure to engage in negotiations was a failure to comply with the pre-action protocol. However he had failed to take into account the extent to which that factor had already in his reasoning reduced S&#8217;s entitlement by one-third or one-quarter. No further reduction should have been made for the fact that S had not engaged in negotiations in accordance with the protocol. In the circumstances, to reduce the recovery of costs to nil for failure to comply with the protocol was so seriously wrong as to be outside the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement was possible. The judge had misdirected himself as to the applicability of the general rule and had failed to appreciate that the reduction he had first made reflected the appropriate discount for the running of a case that failed. (3) It was necessary for the court to exercise the discretion afresh. Guidance could be obtained from the judge&#8217;s view as to the way he would have treated S as the successful party without T&#8217;s willingness to negotiate and in the absence of a Part 36 offer, with a further discount for non-compliance with the protocol. On that basis S should have 60 per cent of his costs from the date of the Part 36 offer. The judge&#8217;s order for the period up until that date was not disturbed.</p></div></div> </div>

One of M&#8217;s children was killed and her husband and other two children were severely injured in a road accident. The incident was reported to M while she was at her home, some two miles from the scene.

If it was reasonably foreseeable that M would suffer nervous shock, even though nowhere near the scene of the accident, she was entitled to recover. In considering the question of reasonable foreseeability there are no legal limitations of time, space, distance, nature of injuries, or the relationship of victim to plaintiff, although these are all factors to be considered (Bourhill v Young [1943] A.C. 92 and Hambrook v Stokes Bros [1925] 1 K.B. 141 applied; King v Phillips [1953] 1 Q.B. 429 dictum approved).</div></div> </div>

T had to show that there was a relationship of proximity between N and herself in the legal sense. Unfortunately, proximity depended more on the court&#8217;s perception of what was the reasonable area for the imposition of liability than any process of logic. In the instant case, N&#8217;s negligence had two consequences separated by three weeks in time: there was the accident which caused M&#8217;s injuries, and then there was her death. There was clearly a relationship between N and M, but to allow T to recover as a secondary victim on the instant facts was going too far. Had the judge been correct then T would, subject to proving causation, have been able to recover damages had M&#8217;s death occurred months, possibly years later. However, had she died at the time of the accident and T suffered shock coming onto the scene shortly afterwards, T would not have been able to recover damages because she would have failed to satisfy the physical proximity control mechanism. That T could recover in the first situation but not in the latter would strike the ordinary reasonable person as incomprehensible. Therefore, it was not reasonable to impose liability on N for T&#8217;s psychiatric illness. The judge&#8217;s approach potentially extended the scope of liability to secondary victims considerably further than had been done before. The court had for policy reasons confined the rights of secondary victims by means of strict control mechanisms. Those same reasons militated against any further substantial extension unless done by Parliament. The judge was wrong to hold that M&#8217;s death was the relevant event for the purpose of deciding the proximity question, Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1992] 1 A.C. 310 followed, White v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1999] 2 A.C. 455, Taylor v Somerset HA [1993] P.I.Q.R.

He claimed that he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of seeing his wife&#8217;s state during two specific episodes. However, the necessary element of suddenness did not exist. Further, his wife&#8217;s appearance was not exceptional for a person in hospital in such circumstances and was not &#8220;horrifying&#8221; in the sense used in the authorities.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>(1) The circumstances fell far short of those which had been recognised as founding secondary victim liability. The judge had been wrong to treat as one event the period of about 36 hours beginning with the sight of W before surgery, through to the moment when he saw her in her post-operative swollen state. Unlike the situation in Walters v North Glamorgan NHS Trust [2002] EWCA Civ 1792, [2003] P.I.Q.R. P16, there was no &#8220;seamless tale with an obvious beginning and an equally obvious end&#8221;. Instead, there was a series of events over a period of time. R&#8217;s perception of what he saw on the two specific occasions was in each case informed by information which he had received in advance. Before the operation, he already knew that abnormalities had been found and he knew before seeing W that she was about to go to theatre for surgery. It was artificial to regard the sight of her in her pre-operative condition as the beginning of an event distinct from what had gone before. It was equally artificial to describe the sight of W in her post-operative condition as the end of a distinct event. It had been explained to R, before he saw her, that W&#8217;s life was in danger and he knew that the 24 hours following the operation would be critical. It was all part of a continuum. The necessary element of suddenness did not exist. Further, what R saw on those two occasions was not horrifying by objective standards, Shorter v Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust [2015] EWHC 614 (QB), (2015) 144 B.M.L.R. 136 applied. Walters was the only known reported case in which a claimant had succeeded as a secondary victim after observing the consequences of clinical negligence in a hospital setting. That was unsurprising. In hospital, one had to expect to see patients attached to machines and drips and to see things that one might not like to see. W&#8217;s appearance was as would ordinarily be expected of a person in hospital in such circumstances. It was not exceptional or &#8220;horrifying&#8221; in the sense in which that word was used in the authorities. It did not lead to a sudden violent agitation of the mind because R had been prepared to witness a person in a desperate condition and was, moreover, already extremely angry, Walters distinguished, White v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1999] 2 A.C. 455 and Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1992] 1 A.C. 310 followed (see paras 17, 33-42 of judgment). (2) The claim failed because the events had not been&#8221; horrifying&#8221; in the necessary sense. It was therefore unnecessary to determine whether the judge had been justified in finding that R&#8217;s adjustment disorder had been caused by W&#8217;s appearance on the two distinct occasions concerned, as opposed to being caused by her ill health. However, it seemed that the judge had given insufficient weight to the circumstance that R was already extremely angry before he saw W after her operation. Further, having found none of the persistent recurrent flashbacks or nightmares which characterise PTSD, the judge should have been far less ready to attribute causative potency to the two visual images rather than to the whole set of circumstances (paras 43-48).</p></div></div> </div>

W, who was responsible for four teams of social services fieldworkers employed by the NCC, suffered a mental breakdown in November 1986 and was forced to spend four months away from work. This breakdown followed a lengthy period over which W&#8217;s work pressures increased significantly and, despite repeated attempts to do so, he had not persuaded the NCC either to increase staff or provide guidance as to work distribution or prioritisation. Upon his return he was offered no additional support from the NCC and by September 16, 1987 he was advised to go on sick leave and suffered a second mental breakdown. He was dismissed on the grounds of permanent ill-health in February 1988 and brought an action for damages against the NCC for breach of their duty of care to take reasonable steps to avoid exposing him to a health-endangering workload.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; upholding W&#8217;s claim for damages, that (1) there is no logical reason why the risk of psychiatric damage should be excluded from the scope of an employer&#8217;s duty to provide his employee with a reasonably safe system of work and to take reasonable steps to protect him from risks which are reasonably foreseeable, Bolton v Stone [1947-51] C.L.Y. 6789 considered. Once a duty of care has been established the standard of care required for the performance of that duty must be measured against the yardstick of reasonable conduct on the part of a person in the position of that person who owes the duty, Glasgow Corp v Muir [1943] A.C. 448 , Paris v Stepney BC [1951] A.C. 367 considered, and the practicability of the remedial measures must clearly take into account the resources and facilities of the person or body owing the duty of care, British Railways Board v Herrington [1972] A.C. 877 considered. The duty does not extend to negligible risks but only to materially substantial risks. Although the evidence established that prior to W&#8217;s first breakdown it was reasonably foreseeable that W might sustain a mental breakdown of some sort in consequence of his work, it was not reasonably foreseeable to the NCC that the workload to which he was exposed gave rise to a material risk of mental illness, in the sense that the risk to which W was exposed was higher than that which would ordinarily affect a social services middle manager in his position; (2) when W returned to work after his first illness it was reasonably foreseeable to the NCC that if he was again exposed to the same workload as he had been handling at the time of his first breakdown without substantial back-up there was a sizeable risk that he would again succumb to mental illness and that such illness would be likely to end his career; and (3) in deciding whether it was reasonable for the NCC to take action to alleviate that risk regard must be had to the acute staffing problems then experienced by the NCC. However, it was wrong to say that, in the context of a contract of employment between a statutory body and an employee, the statutory body could rely on considerations of policy both to justify a decision which caused damage or injury to the employee, and to prevent the court from evaluating the reasonableness of the body&#8217;s conduct, Anns v Merton LBC [1978] A.C. 728 , Lavis v Kent CC 90 L.G.R. 416 considered. Having regard to the size of the risk of a repetition of W&#8217;s mental illness and the likely gravity of that illness, the standard of care expected of a reasonable local authority required that the NCC take measures to ensure that W&#8217;s workload was permanently reduced, either through additional assistance or restructuring of the social services.</div></div> </div>

B had been employed by the local authority as a teacher. In September 1995 there was a restructuring of staffing at the school at which B was employed, and B was told that in order to maintain his salary level he would have to take on further responsibilities. B worked between 61 and 70 hours per week, and often had to work in the evenings and at weekends. In February 1996 B spoke of &#8220;work overload&#8221; to the school&#8217;s deputy headteacher, and made enquiries about taking early retirement. In May B was absent from work for three weeks, his absence certified by his GP as being due to stress and depression. On his return to work B met with members of the school&#8217;s senior management team and said that he was not coping with his workload and that the situation was becoming detrimental to his health. He was not met with an entirely sympathetic response and no steps were taken to assist him. B contacted his GP on a number of occasions about work related stress and in November 1996, after losing control and shaking a pupil, he left the school and did not return. Since that time B had been unable to work as a teacher, or to do any work other than undemanding part time work. The issue was whether the Court of Appeal had been right to conclude that the evidence before the trial judge did not sustain a finding that the school authorities ought to have foreseen that, if B continued with his existing workload, he was liable to develop a psychiatric illness.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal (Lord Scott dissenting), that the issue of the breach of the local authority&#8217;s duty of care to B was borderline. The trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, had concluded that the local authority had been in breach and there was insufficient reason for the Court of Appeal to set aside that finding. The test was whether the local authority had fallen below the standard properly to be expected of a reasonable and prudent employer taking positive steps for the safety of his workers in the light of what he knew or ought to have known, Stokes v Guest Keen &amp; Nettlefold (Bolt &amp; Nuts) Ltd [1968] 1 W.L.R. 1776 applied. The Court of Appeal had failed to give adequate weight to the fact that B, an experienced and conscientious teacher, had been absent for three weeks with no physical ailment, such absence having been certified by his GP as being due to stress and depression. The duty to take some action had arisen in June or July 1996 when B had seen members of the school&#8217;s senior management team, and had continued so long as nothing had been done to help him. The senior management team should have made enquiries about B&#8217;s problems and discovered what they could have done to ease them, and the fact that the school as a whole was facing severe problems, with all the teachers stressed and overworked, did not mean that there was nothing that could have been done to help B, Cross v Highlands &amp; Islands Enterprise 2001 S.L.T. 1060 considered. The trial judge had been entitled to form the view that the school&#8217;s senior management team were in a position of continuing breach of the employer&#8217;s duty of care, and that had caused B&#8217;s breakdown in November 1996. (Per Lord Scott) The Court of Appeal had accurately expressed the principles that ought to be applied where a complaint was made of psychiatric illness brought about by stress at work, and these principles were to be preferred to the decision in Stokes , which addressed the question of whether the employer had provided a safe system of work, rather than the problems of psychiatric illness caused by stress.</div></div> </div>

In response to health concerns expressed by the workforce following a new lubricant paint being introduced G had provided protective equipment for use when spraying. However, despite the availability of this equipment, C should not have worked with the new paint because he suffered from a mild constitutional predisposition to asthma. Initially, neither C nor his employer were aware of this. C was seen by the works doctor complaining of severe headaches and giddiness. The doctor sent a memo to the business team manager stating that in his opinion C should not work with the new paint. The memo was not received by the team leader and in the result C remained at work as a paint and line operator. A few weeks later, after having been taken to hospital following a fall, C was formally diagnosed as suffering from occupational asthma caused by exposure to irritant fumes at work. The judge found that whilst G had taken all reasonable precautions up to the date C was seen by the works doctor, thereafter G had been under a duty to remove him from a dangerous work situation and that a reasonable employer would have acted within a few days of the doctor&#8217;s memo having been sent.

G contended that in cases such as the present one, it was for the employee to decide whether or not to take the risk of continuing in his job, there being no duty upon the employer to remove the employee from safe work, still less to dismiss him because he was not suited to the work.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that whether or not an employer in a particular case was under a duty to remove an employee from employment which exposed him to a risk of physical danger was dependant upon the magnitude of the risk involved, Withers v Perry Chain Co Ltd [1961] 1 W.L.R. 1314 distinguished. In the instant case, the trial judge had been correct in concluding that G had been negligent in failing to follow the advice of their works doctor by moving C to alternative work or by dismissing him.</div></div> </div>

Where a diplomat was not in the post or discharging the functions of the post, the policy considerations justifying immunity did not establish a proportional restriction of the implied ECHR art.6 right of access to a court.</p><p></p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Application refused.<p>(1) An individual was required to be discharging the functions of the diplomatic post to benefit from immunity, Empson v Smith [1966] 1 Q.B. 426 applied. A balance had evolved to protect the functionality of a mission while recognising the need to minimise abuse of diplomatic immunity and protect the implied right of access to a court in ECHR art.6. That balance underlaid the policy considerations regarding immunity and established the proportionality of the restriction in ECHR terms. If the diplomat was not in the post discharging functions, what remained was only unjustified privilege or immunity linked solely to an individual&#8217;s private actions. In that case the policy considerations and proportionality of the restriction could not be justified, and could not pursue a legitimate claim sufficient to eclipse the wife&#8217;s right of access to court, Al-Malki v Reyes [2015] EWCA Civ 32, [2016] 2 All E.R. 136 followed, Fogarty v United Kingdom (37112/97) [2002] I.R.L.R. 148 considered. The husband had no pre-existing connection to St Lucia, no evident knowledge or experience of maritime matters, and had not undertaken any duties of any kind since his appointment, which had coincided with the emergent relationship with his third wife. The court was satisfied that the husband had obtained a diplomatic appointment with the sole aim of defeating the wife&#8217;s claims. The appointment was an entirely artificial construct. International comity could not be weighed in the balance when the post was an empty husk. The court would not accede to the husband&#8217;s request to strike out the wife&#8217;s Part III claim (see paras 19-20, 34-36, 40 of judgment).</p><p>(2) If to the contrary the husband had acquired diplomatic immunity, the extent of the immunity was governed by the 2002 Order. Pursuant to that order and the VCDR art.31, the husband could enjoy full diplomatic immunity from civil action if he was not permanently resident in the UK, none of the VCDR exceptions applied and immunity was compatible with ECHR art.6 and art.8. Neither the 2002 Order nor the VCDR definitively defined permanent residence for that purpose and the facts surrounding it required careful evaluation. A &#8220;balance sheet&#8221; approach to the factors pointing to and against the status was not very helpful, F (A Child) (International Relocation Cases), Re [2015] EWCA Civ 882 considered. Relevant factors included that the husband was an international businessman, his limited UK visa, and that in his three marriages the family home had always been in the UK and the children brought up in the UK. The person&#8217;s intention was highly relevant but not determinative, and a qualitative rather than quantitative assessment of the intention was more accurate. The most important factor was that each of the husband&#8217;s family units and family homes had been based in the UK, by choice. That signalled an intention which was &#8220;unlimited in period&#8221; and therefore qualified as permanent, Gulbenkian v Gulbenkian [1937] 4 All E.R. 618 applied. He could therefore claim immunity only when exercising official functions; that did not apply to his defence to the wife&#8217;s claim (paras 41-44, 50-51, 64-67).</p><p>(3) Although not necessary to decide, the claim would not have met the &#8220;real action exemption&#8221; test in the VCDR art.31(1)(a). Applications for orders transferring title to property in financial disputes on the breakdown of marriages did not fall within the exception, Intpro Properties (UK) v Sauvel [1983] Q.B. 1019, Laverty v Laverty [1994] CPC (3d) 91 and De Andrade v De Andrade [1984] 118 ILR 299 applied (paras 73-74).</p></div></div> </div>

It also considered the issue of jurisdiction under the Lugano Convention 2007 art.5(3) in the context of a conspiracy implemented in England to wrongfully deal with assets located abroad in breach of a worldwide freezing order.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Application refused.<p>(1) The bank relied on Surzur Overseas Ltd v Koros [1999] 2 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep. 611. However, that case simply suggested, but did not decide, that breaches of a freezing order could amount to unlawful means, Surzur considered (see paras 8-10 of judgment). It was necessary to consider whether there was a positive common law rule preventing the court from awarding damages to one party following another&#8217;s breach of a court order. The law of contempt was concerned with maintaining the authority of the court in the public interest. Since it was not focussed on compensating litigants who had suffered loss, principle suggested that it did not confer a power to award damages. While some authorities suggested that there was jurisdiction to award damages for contempt, none expressly decided the point and none grappled with the principle that the contempt jurisdiction was concerned with the public interest rather than private redress. Even Chapman v Honig [1963] 2 Q.B. 502, which was often referred to as having decided the issue, simply identified the opposing arguments without resolving them, Chapman considered. The observations of the House of Lords in Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank Plc [2006] UKHL 28, [2007] 1 A.C. 181 were a very clear indication that damages could not be awarded for contempt, and the instant court had to apply them. The argument from principle was compelling: the court had no power to order damages for contempt, Hudson, Re [1966] Ch. 209 considered and Barclays Bank applied (paras 16-21, 72-77). However, that simply meant that damages could not be awarded where contempt was the only basis for the claim. Where the claim was based on a conspiracy to injure by unlawful means, namely a contempt, the contempt was not the only basis of the claim. Barclays Bank did not preclude the court from regarding a contempt as unlawful means: while a third party with knowledge of a freezing order was not liable in negligence for damages caused by his failure to obey its terms, that did not mean that a third party who conspired to breach the terms of a freezing order was not liable in the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means. Moreover, the reasoning in Customs and Excise Commissioners v Total Network SL [2008] UKHL 19, [2008] 1 A.C. 1174 provided strong support for the conclusion that a contempt could amount to unlawful means, Total Network applied. Although the court in Digicel (St Lucia) Ltd v Cable &amp; Wireless Plc [2010] EWHC 774 (Ch) had refused to extend unlawful means to non-criminal breaches of Regulations, contempts of court were sufficiently reprehensible to justify treating them as unlawful means, Digicel considered. The bank had a good arguable case that D2 had committed the tort of conspiracy to injure by unlawful means (paras 22-26).</p><p>(2)(a) The bank&#8217;s art.6(1) argument on jurisdiction was that when the proceedings were issued against D2, D1 was domiciled in England, which meant that D2 could be sued in England. However, at that time, D1 had abandoned England as his country of residence and hence domicile. Although he had been domiciled in England until his flight to France, he was in custody in France fighting extradition to Russia when the proceedings against D2 were issued. It was unlikely that he would return to England were he not extradited to Russia: he had fled England once, had no connections there, and was liable to arrest and detention there (paras 28-30, 33-36).</p><p>(2)(b) The court did, however, have jurisdiction under art.5(3), England being the place &#8220;where the harmful event occurred&#8221;. That phrase encompassed the place where the damage occurred and the place of the event giving rise to the damage, Handelswekerij GJ Bier BV and Stichtung Reinwater (The Reinwater Foundation) v Mines de Potasse d&#8217;Alsace SA (4320/74) [1979] E.C.C. 206 applied. The damage did not occur in England, because the assets were held abroad and bank&#8217;s loss was the receivers&#8217; inability to realise those assets, AMT Futures Ltd v Marzillier, Dr Meier &amp; Dr Guntner Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH [2015] EWCA Civ 143, [2015] Q.B. 699 applied (paras 38-44). However, the bank had much the better argument that England was the place of the event giving rise to the damage in respect of part of the claim. That event was the implementation, rather than the hatching,of the conspiracy, Domicrest Ltd v Swiss Bank Corp [1999] Q.B. 548 considered. Up until February 2012, the conspiracy had been implemented by instructions given by D1 in London (paras 45-54).</p></div></div> </div>

The claimant (C) had engaged the first defendant (D1) to install air conditioning in C&#8217;s factory. D1 had subcontracted ducting work to the second defendant (D2) and D2 had contracted with D3 to provide fitters and fitters&#8217; mates on a labour only basis. A fitter&#8217;s mate supplied by D3, who was working with a fitter supplied by D3, both under the supervision of a fitter contracted to D2, negligently caused a flood. The judge determined that D3 and not D2 was vicariously liable for the negligence of the fitter&#8217;s mate. The issue on appeal was whether both D2 and D3, rather than only one of them, could be vicariously liable for the negligence of the fitter&#8217;s mate. D3 submitted that dual vicarious liability was not a legal possibility and that D2 alone should be liable. D2 submitted that D3 alone should be liable but that dual vicarious liability was a legal possibility.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that (1) correctly formulated, the question to determine vicarious liability was who was entitled to exercise control over the relevant act or operation of the fitter&#8217;s mate. To look for a transfer of a contract of employment was distracting and misleading. The fitter&#8217;s mate&#8217;s employment was not transferred. The inquiry should concentrate on the relevant negligent act and then ask whose responsibility it was to prevent it: who was entitled and obliged to give orders as to how the work should or should not be done. Entire and absolute control was not a necessary precondition of vicarious liability, Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins &amp; Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd [1947] A.C. 1 and Denham v Midland Employers Mutual Assurance [1955] 2 Q.B. 437 considered. (2) On the facts of the instant case both D2&#8217;s fitter and D3&#8217;s fitter had been entitled, and if they had had the opportunity obliged, to prevent the mate&#8217;s negligence. (3) It had been assumed since the early 19th century to be the law that where an employee who was lent by one employer to work for another was negligent, liability had to rest on one employer or the other, but not both. But the foundation on which that rested was a slender one and the contrary had never been properly argued. There was no authority binding the court to hold that dual vicarious liability was legally impossible, Donovan v Laing Wharton and Down Construction Syndicate Ltd [1893] 1 Q.B. 629 and Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Hall Russell &amp; Co Ltd (The Esso Bernicia) [1989] A.C. 643 considered. (4) Dual vicarious liability was legally possible and both D2 and D3 were vicariously liable for the mate&#8217;s negligence. (5) If the relevant relationships led to the conclusion of dual control over the employee, it was likely that the measure of control was equal. That was so in the instant case and, applying the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 , the just and equitable division of responsibility between D2 and D3 was equal. D2 and D3 should contribute 50 per cent of their several liabilities to C.</div></div> </div>

An assault by the doorman on a member of the public caused an &#8220;accidental&#8221; bodily injury for the purposes of the employer&#8217;s public liability insurance.</p><p>The appellants (L and F) appealed against a decision ([2005] EWHC 5, [2005] Lloyd&#8217;s Rep. I.R. 275) that a doorman supplied to a nightclub was deemed to be a temporary employee of the nightclub for the purposes of vicarious liability. L operated a nightclub and contracted with a supplier (S) for the provision of security services including doormen. A doorman (W) supplied to the club under that agreement assaulted a member of the public (C) and was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm. C sued S as W&#8217;s employer and L as his &#8220;temporary deemed employer&#8221;. C claimed that S and L had been negligent and were liable for W&#8217;s tortious act. S had gone into liquidation and C obtained judgment in default against it. S was covered by insurance issued by F but F declined to indemnify S. The judge held that L was vicariously liable because it had had sufficient control over W to make him a temporary deemed employee. He also found that C&#8217;s bodily injury was &#8220;accidental&#8221; within the meaning of F&#8217;s policy even though W had deliberately punched C intending to do him serious harm. He gave judgment against L and declared that F was liable to indemnify S. On L&#8217;s claim against S for a contribution under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 he assessed S&#8217;s contribution at nil. He declined to consider setting aside the default judgment. L submitted that the judge had been wrong to find that W was a deemed temporary employee of L; alternatively that both L and S were vicariously liable for W&#8217;s act; and that the judge had been wrong to find a nil contribution against S under the 1978 Act since S&#8217;s fault was more than negligible. F submitted that S&#8217;s contribution was rightly set at nil, that the default judgment should be set aside and that C&#8217;s injury was not within the policy wording.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeals, that (1) it had been open to the judge on the facts to find that L had become W&#8217;s deemed employer. Vicarious liability required no fault on the part of the employer or, in the instant case, the deemed employer. The contract between S and L was for the provision of labour only. By using S&#8217;s services L did not gain access to a team of trained specialists on whose skill and expertise it depended. L had no need to rely on S&#8217;s staff but merely chose to do so. L exercised detailed control not only over what the doormen did but how they were to do it. Effective control of the doormen had vested in L. L had control of and responsibility for S&#8217;s employees in fact and by virtue of the contractual provisions, Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins &amp; Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd [1947] A.C. 1 applied. (2) In the circumstances it would not be appropriate to attribute vicarious liability to both S and L, since there had been effectively and substantially a transfer of control and responsibility from S to L, Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern) Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 1151, [2006] Q.B. 510 considered. (3) The lack of fault of a person vicariously liable for the wrongful act of his employee was not relevant for the purposes of determining contribution proceedings between that person and another wrongdoer, Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2002] UKHL 48, [2003] 2 A.C. 366 applied. It had been open to the judge to find that, as between the defendants, S&#8217;s negligence had a negligible causative effect and to assess S&#8217;s contribution at nil. (4) It was not appropriate or in the interests of justice to permit F to reopen the issue of the default judgment. (5) The judge had been right to hold that the question whether the injury caused to C was accidental or fortuitous had to be judged from the perspective of the assured, S, rather than that of the individual perpetrator, W, and that the injury was indeed accidental or fortuitous within the meaning of the policy. S and W were to be treated as separate from the perspective of the policy, so that the intention of W in causing the bodily injury should not be attributed to S. The judge reached the right conclusion that the cover afforded to S by the policy did extend to the liability of S to C in respect of damages for the serious bodily injury inflicted on him by W.</div></div> </div>

Nor had P&#8217;s workers become part of O&#8217;s business; their work had been very temporary, taking place over a couple of days. The judge had also failed to address the fact that four men had been supplied instead of two. O could not be liable for employees whose work they had not contracted, but there was no basis on which to distinguish between the two for which they might be liable and the two for which they were not liable. The court had been wrong to equate supervision with control. The right to supervise did not, without more, carry with it the entitlement to instruct how to do the work, particularly in the context of skilled labour, Hawley v Luminar Leisure Ltd [2006] EWCA Civ 18, [2006] I.R.L.R. 817 considered and Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern) Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 1151, [2006] Q.B. 510 distinguished on the basis that both defendants&#8217; employees had been present when the negligent act took place, whereas in the instant case, M&#8217;s employees were present but O&#8217;s were not. The court had also failed to acknowledge that the burden on a party seeking to show a transfer of liability for an employee was a heavy one. Exceptional facts were required for a contractor to be vicariously liable for the negligence of his sub-contractor and those facts were not present in the instant case, Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins &amp; Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd [1947] A.C. 1, Smith v Blandford Gee Cementation Co [1970] 3 All E.R. 154 and Denham v Midland Employers Mutual Assurance [1955] 2 Q.B. 437 considered. (2) Regarding liability for ultra-hazardous acts, the principle in Honeywill was anomalous and so unsatisfactory that its application should be kept as narrow as possible and should be truly exceptional.

It was also difficult to reconcile the principle in Honeywill with the decision in Read v J Lyons &amp; Co Ltd [1947] A.C. 156, Read considered. Honeywill was to be applied only to activities that were exceptionally dangerous whatever precautions were taken, Honeywill distinguished.

However, it was wrong to conclude that the relationship between the tortfeasor and the person against whom liability was sought had to be sufficiently close. If there was a close connection test, it was that the relationship between the defendant and the tortfeasor had to be so close to a relationship of employer and employee that for vicarious liability purposes it could fairly be said to be akin to employment, Doe v Bennett considered. The test was whether the relationship of the bishop and B was so close in character to one of employer and employee that it was just and fair to hold the employer vicariously liable (see paras 61-63 of judgment). Applying the control test, a priest was subject to no direct control in the sense of the bishop checking what he did every single day, but there was a level of control in the sense that if certain things did not happen then action could be taken. Moreover, under canon law, priests were bound by special obligation to show reverence and obedience to their ordinary. Abuse of a child was a gross breach of ecclesiastical law and if it came to the bishop&#8217;s knowledge, he would be bound to dismiss the priest from his office. A priest also operated within a pre-existing framework of rights and obligations set out in the Code of Canon Law and was ultimately subject to the sanctions and control of his bishop to whom he was accountable, Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern) Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 1151, [2006] Q.B. 510 applied, Bazley v Curry (1999) 174 D.L.R. (4th) 45 considered (paras 74-76). The problem in relation to the organisation test was in identifying the employer&#8217;s business. However, the Roman Catholic Church looked like a business and operated like one. The Pope was in the head office; there were &#8220;regional offices&#8221; with appointed bishops; and the &#8220;local branches&#8221; were parishes with their appointed priests (para.77). In relation to the integration test, the role of the parish priest was wholly integrated into the organisational structure of the Church&#8217;s enterprise. He was part and parcel of the organisation, not only accessory to it, Viasystems and Stevenson Jordan &amp; Harrison v MacDonald &amp; Evans [1952] 1 T.L.R. 101 applied (para.78). The question in relation to the entrepreneur test was whether the priest was more like an independent contractor than an employee. He was not paid a salary directly, but was dependent on what he could take from collections given at Mass. However, any surplus formed part of the parish funds. His situation was akin to being paid a wage and certainly did not resonate with being an entrepreneur (para.79). B did not match every facet of being an employee, but the result of each test led to the conclusion that he was more like an employee than an independent contractor. The relationship was akin to employment within the meaning which an ordinary person would give the words, Cassidy v Ministry of Health [1951] 2 K.B. 343 applied. He was in a relationship with his bishop which was close enough and sufficiently akin to that of employer and employee to make it just and fair to impose vicarious liability. Justice and fairness was used as a salutary check on the conclusion, but was not a stand-alone test (paras 80-84).</p></div></div> </div>

The relationship between the teaching brothers and the Institute was sufficiently akin to that of employer and employees to satisfy the first stage of the test: the Institute was subdivided into a hierarchical structure and conducted its activities as if it were a corporate body; the teaching activity of the brothers was undertaken because the Provincial directed them to undertake it; although the brothers entered into contracts of employment with those managing the school, they did so because the Provincial required them to do so; the teaching activity undertaken by the brothers was in furtherance of the objective, or mission, of the Institute; further, the manner in which the brother teachers were obliged to conduct themselves as teachers was dictated by the Institute&#8217;s rules (see paras 21, 56, 60 of judgment). As to the second stage of the test, the precise criteria for imposing vicarious liability for sexual abuse were still in the course of refinement by judicial decision, but a common theme arose from the authorities. Vicarious liability was imposed where a defendant, whose relationship with the abuser put it in a position to use the abuser to carry on its business or to further its own interests, had done so in a manner which had created or significantly enhanced the risk that the victim or victims would suffer the relevant abuse. The essential closeness of connection between the relationship between the defendant and the tortfeasor and the acts of abuse thus involved a strong causative link. Those were the criteria that established the necessary &#8220;close connection&#8221; between relationship and abuse. It was not right to say that creation of risk was simply a policy consideration and not one of the criteria. It was not enough, of itself, to give rise to vicarious liability for abuse but it was always likely to be an important element in the facts that gave rise to such liability. Here, both the necessary relationship between the brothers and the Institute and the close connection between that relationship and the abuse committed at the school had been made out. As to the former, the relationship between the Institute and the brothers enabled the Institute to place the brothers in teaching positions and, in particular, in the position of headmaster at the school. The standing that the brothers enjoyed as members of the Institute led the managers of that school to comply with the decisions of the Institute as to who should fill that key position. It was particularly significant that the Institute provided the headmasters, for the running of the school was largely carried out by the headmasters. The brother headmaster was almost always the Director of the Institute&#8217;s community, living on the school premises. There was thus a very close connection between the relationship between the brothers and the Institute and the employment of the brothers as teachers in the school. There was also a very close connection between the brother teachers&#8217; employment in the school and the sexual abuse that they committed or must be assumed to have committed. There was no Criminal Records Bureau at the time, but the risk of sexual abuse was recognised, as demonstrated by the prohibition in the Institute&#8217;s rules on touching children. The placement of brother teachers at the school, a residential school in the precincts of which they also resided, greatly enhanced the risk of abuse by them if they had a propensity for such misconduct (paras 85-88, 91, 93).</p></div></div> </div>

The Ministry of Justice was vicariously liable for injury caused by a negligent act of a prisoner undertaking paid kitchen work.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>(1) The Christian Brothers approach extended the scope of vicarious liability beyond an employer&#8217;s responsibility for the acts of its employees, but did not impose liability where a tortfeasor&#8217;s activities were entirely attributable to an independent business. The defendant did not have to carry on commercial activities, nor did it need to derive a profit from the tortfeasor&#8217;s activities. It was sufficient that there was a defendant carrying on activities in furtherance of its own interests. Defendants could not avoid liability by technical arguments about the employment status of the tortfeasor, Christian Brothers explained, Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Thermal Transfer (Northern) Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 1151, [2006] Q.B. 510 and E v English Province of Our Lady of Charity [2012] EWCA Civ 938, [2013] Q.B. 722 applied (see paras 29-31 of judgment).</p><p>(2) The Christian Brothers requirements were met and the ministry was vicariously liable, Christian Brothers applied. The Prison Service carried on activities in furtherance of its aims. The fact that the aims were not commercially motivated, but served the public interest, was no bar to imposing vicarious liability. Prisoners working in the kitchens were integrated into the operation of the prison, so that the activities assigned to them by the Prison Service formed an integral part of the activities it carried on, in particular the activity of providing meals for prisoners. The prisoners were placed in a position where there was a risk that they could commit a variety of negligent acts within the field of activities assigned to them. Further, they worked under the direction of prison staff. C had been injured as a result of negligence by the prisoner in carrying on the activities assigned to him (para.32). The fact that setting prisoners to work was one means by which the Prison Service sought to rehabilitate prisoners did not alter that conclusion. Rehabilitation was not the only objective: the Prison Service also intended that prisoners should contribute to the cost of their upkeep by providing services. The prisoners&#8217; activities formed part of the operation of the prison and were of benefit to the Prison Service itself. It was not essential to the imposition of vicarious liability that the defendant should seek to make a profit. Nor did it depend on alignment of the objectives of the defendant and the tortfeasor. The fact that prisoners were required to serve part of their sentence in prison and to undertake work there for nominal wages, bound them into a closer relationship with the Prison Service than would be the case for an employee. The fact that payments were below commercial level reflected the context in which prisoners worked, but did not mean that vicarious liability should not be imposed. Payment of a wage was not essential, Christian Brothers applied. The fact that prison operators were under a statutory duty to provide prisoners with useful work was not incompatible with vicarious liability. The Christian Brothers criteria were designed to ensure that vicarious liability was imposed where it was fair, just and reasonable to do so; where the criteria were satisfied, it would not generally be necessary to reassess the fairness of the result. However, where a case concerned circumstances which had not previously been the subject of authoritative judicial decision, it could be valuable to consider fairness. The instant appeal was such a case; however, for the Prison Service to be liable to compensate for negligence by the prison catering team appeared just and reasonable whether the tortfeasor was a civilian or a prisoner. The court rejected arguments based on the risk of further claims being brought (paras 34-45).</p></div></div> </div>

The matter had proceeded before the Court of Appeal, upon the basis that HH was liable for D&#8217;s failure to report the risk of or actual harm caused to the children since, bound by the decision in T v North Yorkshire CC [1999] I.R.L.R. 98 , it had not been open to the court to consider whether HH had been vicariously liable for the actual abuse. T challenged the validity of the decision in T v North Yorkshire CC submitting that employers might be vicariously liable for the sexual torts of an employee even though the sexual abuse could not be considered as an unauthorised mode of carrying out an authorised act.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that the line of authority relating to vicarious liability for intentional torts as exemplified by Morris v CW Martin &amp; Sons Ltd [1966] 1 Q.B. 716 was of general application and was not restricted to bailment cases, T v North Yorkshire CC overruled. When applying the test laid down in Salmond and Heutson on Torts, 21st edition (1996) p.443 in respect of whether a wrongful act was outside the scope of employment, the Court of Appeal in T v North Yorkshire CC had wrongly categorised the sexual assaults which took place as far removed from an unauthorised mode of carrying out a teacher&#8217;s duty and failed to acknowledge the close connection between the employment and the tort, Bazley v Curry (1999) 174 D.L.R. (4th) 45 and Jacobi v Griffiths (1999) 174 D.L.R. (4th) 71 considered. In applying the Salmond test it was crucial to focus on the right act of the employee and its connection with the tortious act Rose v Plenty [1976] 1 W.L.R. 141 considered. The court must not simply consider whether the acts of sexual abuse were modes of doing an authorised act but must also consider whether there existed a close connection between the tort and the employee&#8217;s duties. In the instant case, HH had undertaken to care for the resident children and had entrusted that obligation to D. D&#8217;s torts were so closely connected with his employment that it would be fair and just to hold HH vicariously liable.</div></div> </div>

B had been using a public telephone when an off duty officer announced &#8220;police&#8221; and demanded the phone. When B refused the officer shot him. The Attorney General denied that the officer was acting in the course of his employment or for his employer&#8217;s benefit. B submitted that the contrary was true as a police officer was duty bound to preserve the peace on behalf of his employer at all times, that he had asserted his authority as a police officer and it did not matter whether he had done so in furtherance of his duty as a police officer. Furthermore, the officer had shot B using a revolver that his employer had given him and which he was permitted to carry when off duty, and the officer had subsequently arrested B and charged him with an offence, thereby asserting that at the time of the offence he was acting in the execution of his duty as a police officer.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that an employer could be vicariously liable notwithstanding that the employee was acting exclusively for his or her own benefit.

It was of prime importance that the shooting followed immediately upon the announcement by the officer that he was a policeman, which was probably calculated to create the impression that he was acting on police business. The subsequent arrest of B showed that the officer considered that B had interfered with the execution of his duties as a police officer. Moreover, the creation of the risk inherent in giving the officer a revolver for use at home reinforced the conclusion that vicarious liability was established.</div></div> </div>

J could not order the men to jump but he could order them not to jump. The swimming trips between organised adventure training were obviously and on the evidence subject to military discipline. (2) J owed R and the soldiers a duty of care when they were at the lake. He was the officer in charge of them in Germany, and in the context of the swimming party it was fair, just and reasonable to ascribe to him a duty to take reasonable care to guard his subordinates against the foreseeable risk of injury, if they jumped from the bridge into the lake. By his own presence there in the circumstances that pertained and by reason of his rank, he assumed responsibility to prevent them from taking undue risks of which he was or ought to have been aware. The soldiers asked him if they might jump. That predicated reliance sufficient for a duty of care. The MOD was not the occupier of the lake, Tomlinson v Congleton BC [2003] UKHL 47, [2004] 1 A.C. 46 distinguished. The relationship between MOD and R was that of employer and employee and the MOD, through J, assumed responsibility for R&#8217;s safety, Poppleton v Trustees of the Portsmouth Youth Activities Committee [2008] EWCA Civ 646, [2009] P.I.Q.R. P1 considered. (3) The fact that J owed R and the men a duty of care indicated that he was acting in the course of his employment and that the MOD was vicariously liable for his breach of duty. J&#8217;s job included taking charge of junior officers and men and taking reasonable care for their safety. That extended to doing so on off duty occasions, such as the swimming party, to which the military relationship extended. There was a sufficient connection between J&#8217;s employment as an army officer and his breach of duty, Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2001] UKHL 22, [2002] 1 A.C. 215 followed.

First, C was normally dressed in clerical garb and was so dressed when he first met M. At the very least, that factor set the scene. A priest had a special role, which involved trust and responsibility in a more general way even than a teacher, a doctor or a nurse. It was C&#8217;s employment as a priest by the archdiocese which enabled him, indeed was intended to enable him, to hold himself out as having such a role and such authority. Second, C&#8217;s functions as a priest included a duty to evangelise or to bring the gospel to other people. Accordingly, he was ostensibly performing his duty as a priest employed by the archdiocese by getting to know M. Third, given that M was aged 12 or 13 when his association with C started, it was significant that C was given a special responsibility for youth work at the church. It underlined the point that, when getting to know and effectively &#8220;grooming&#8221; M, C was ostensibly carrying out one of his specifically assigned functions in the church. Fourth, C was able to develop his relationship with M by inviting him to a disco which was on church premises and which he organised as a priest at the church. Thus, M had been drawn into the relationship through the medium of a church-organised function carried on in church premises by C, a priest at the church. Fifth, the relationship was further developed when C got M to clear up after discos. That work, on church premises at the request of a priest at the church, led M to do other work for C. Thus, C&#8217;s role as priest in the archdiocese gave him the status and opportunity to draw M further into his sexually abusive orbit by ostensibly respectable means connected with his employment as a priest at the church. Sixth, the fact that M was working at the request of a priest on premises, namely the presbytery, owned by the priest&#8217;s archdiocese, adjoining the church where the priest worked, and which were lived in by the priest, was relevant to the issue of vicarious liability for the first three reasons mentioned above, namely moral authority, evangelisation and youth work. Seventh, the opportunity to spend time alone with M, especially in the presbytery, had arisen from C&#8217;s role as a priest employed as such by the archdiocese, Jacobi v Griffiths (1999) 174 D.L.R. (4th) 71 and Bazley v Curry (1999) 174 D.L.R. (4th) 45 considered.</p></div></div> </div>

The criteria to be satisfied for establishing vicarious liability involved a two-stage approach. First, there must be a relationship between the individual tortfeasor and the party said to be vicariously liable capable of triggering the doctrine. Second, the tort committed must be sufficiently connected with that relationship, Various Claimants v Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools [2012] UKSC 56, [2013] 2 A.C. 1 applied. It was common ground that R was a serving police officer of the chief constable&#8217;s constabulary and that relationship was therefore capable of giving rise to vicarious liability. The first stage of the criteria was therefore satisfied. It was also true that claims asserting vicarious liability were fact sensitive and, in general, might not lend themselves to determination at a preliminary stage. It did not follow however that in all cases where vicarious liability was alleged a strike out might not be appropriate. In respect of the second stage of the criteria, taken at their highest, the pleaded facts did not reveal any, let alone a close, connection between the acts alleged and R&#8217;s position as a police officer. Given that the letters were anonymous they self evidently could not have purported to have come from a police officer. With regard to the telephone calls, the allegations in no way established that R was acting or was purporting to act as a police officer and accordingly they did not begin to establish a sufficient connection. Again, in relation to the acts of arson and criminal damage, even assuming that R was responsible, whether solely or with others, there was nothing whatsoever to connect those acts with the purported performance of police duties or functions. Were the issue to go to trial, there was therefore no realistic prospect of C making good the second stage of the criteria or bringing the claim within s.88. C&#8217;s claim, if proved, revealed R pursuing a personal vendetta or frolic of her own and that plainly would not do for the purposes of establishing vicarious liability, Weir v Bettison [2003] EWCA Civ 111, [2003] I.C.R. 708 and N v Chief Constable of Merseyside [2006] EWHC 3041 (QB), [2006] Po. L.R. 160 considered (see paras 28-35 of judgment). (2) Article 3 gave rise to an obligation on the part of the State to conduct an effective investigation into allegations that treatment amounted to violation of a person&#8217;s rights. The scope of those obligations would differ greatly depending on whether the violation was inflicted by agents of the State or, at the other end of the scale, private individuals, as in the instant case. A criminal investigation and disciplinary proceedings had been taken against R; the outcome of those was irrelevant for present purposes. The chief constable&#8217;s investigative obligations had been satisfied by the legal mechanisms available to C and the court below had been right to strike out C&#8217;s claim based upon art.3 (paras 47-54).</p></div></div> </div>

Applying that test, the employer of a petrol kiosk attendant who had subjected a customer to an unprovoked assault was liable for his actions.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>(1) After reviewing the development of the doctrine of vicarious liability, the court indicated that the &#8220;close connection&#8221; test adumbrated in Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2001] UKHL 22, [2002] 1 A.C. 215 and Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2002] UKHL 48, [2003] 2 A.C. 366 had been followed in a line of cases, including several at the highest level. There was a risk in attempting to lay down criteria for determining what precisely amounted to a sufficiently close connection to make it just for an employer to be held vicariously liable. A simplification of the essence was more desirable, and in its simplest terms, two matters had to be considered: (a) what functions had been entrusted by the employer to the employee (which had to be addressed broadly); and (b) whether there was sufficient connection between the employee&#8217;s wrongful conduct and the position in which he was employed to make it right for the employer to be fixed with vicarious liability. The cases in which the necessary connection had been found to exist were those in which the employee had used or misused his position in a way which injured the third party, Lloyd v Grace Smith &amp; Co [1912] A.C. 716, Pettersson v Royal Oak Hotel [1948] N.Z.L.R. 136 and Warren v Henlys Ltd [1948] 2 All E.R. 935 considered. There was nothing wrong with the close connection test as such and the law would not be improved by a change of vocabulary, Lister and Dubai Aluminium followed (see paras 42- 46 of judgment). The test should only be abrogated or refined if a demonstrably better test could be devised. However, the proposed &#8220;representative capacity&#8221; test was hopelessly vague. Moreover, while the instant court had suggested in Various Claimants v Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools [2012] UKSC 56, [2013] 2 A.C. 1 that the law of vicarious liability was on the move, such change was a response to changes in the legal relationships between enterprises and members of their workforces, Christian Brothers referred to. There had been no changes in societal conditions requiring a change in the law governing the circumstances in which an employer should be held vicariously liable for the torts of an employee (paras 53-55).</p><p>(2) It was K&#8217;s job to attend to customers and respond to their inquiries. His conduct in answering the claimant&#8217;s request in a foul-mouthed way and ordering him to leave was inexcusable but was within the field of activities assigned to him. What happened thereafter was an unbroken sequence of events. It was not right to regard K as having metaphorically taken off his uniform when he followed the customer onto the forecourt. Moreover, once on the forecourt, K had repeated his order to leave. That was not something personal between him and the customer; he was ordering him to keep away from his employer&#8217;s premises, and he reinforced that order by violence. In doing so he was purporting to act in the furtherance of his employer&#8217;s business. While it was a gross abuse of his position, it was in connection with the business in which he was employed. Since the supermarket had entrusted him with the position of serving customers it was just that it should be held responsible for his abuse of that position. Finally, it was irrelevant that it looked as if K was motivated by personal racism rather than a desire to benefit his employer&#8217;s business (paras 47-49, 57).</p><p>(3) Although the claims and issues in the instant case were separate from those in Cox v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10, [2016] 2 W.L.R. 806, that and the instant judgment were intended to be complementary in their legal analysis. The instant court agreed with the reasoning and conclusion of Lord Reed in that case (para.1).</p></div></div> </div>

Its purposes were (a) to promote employee share ownership, particularly by encouraging share incentive schemes; (b) since such schemes required benefits to be contingent on future performance, creating a problem if tax was charged on the acquisition of the shares, to wait and see in such cases until the contingency had fallen away; and (c) to counteract consequent opportunities for tax avoidance, Grays Timber Products Ltd v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2010] UKSC 4, [2010] 1 W.L.R. 497 followed. The background to Ch.2 supported that view: it had been enacted to address aspects of previous provisions which had left them vulnerable to avoidance or created anomalies. It was in that context that it was necessary to consider the scope of the exemption conferred by s.425(2), and more specifically whether, in s.423(1), &#8220;any contract, agreement, arrangement or condition which makes provision to which any of subsections (2) to (4) applies&#8221; referred to &#8220;provision&#8221; with a genuine business or commercial purpose. The fact that Ch.2 had been introduced partly to forestall tax avoidance schemes self-evidently made it difficult to attribute to Parliament an intention that it should apply to schemes which were carefully crafted to fall within its scope purely for the purpose of tax avoidance. Further, it was difficult to accept that Parliament could have intended to encourage by exemption from taxation the award of shares to employees where the award of the shares had no purpose other than the obtaining of the exemption, a matter which was reflected in the fact that the shares were in a company which was brought into existence merely for the purposes of the scheme. The background to the legislation indicated that the s.425(2) exemption was designed to address the problem of valuing a benefit which was, for real-world business or commercial reasons, subject to a restrictive condition involving a contingency. Nothing suggested that Parliament had intended that s.423(2) should apply to transactions having no real-world business connection. Accordingly, adopting a purposive construction, the reference in s.423(1) to &#8220;any contract, agreement, arrangement or condition which makes provision to which any of subsections (2) to (4) applies&#8221;, was to be construed as being limited to provision having a business or commercial purpose, and not to commercially irrelevant conditions whose only purpose was the obtaining of the exemption (see paras 74-78, 85 of judgment).</p><p>(2) The condition in UBS&#8217;s case was arbitrary and had no business or commercial rationale beyond tax avoidance. Such a condition was not relevant to the application of s.423. The condition was to be disregarded, meaning that the shares were not restricted securities within s.423. The restrictive condition in DB&#8217;s case was equally artificial. The forfeiture provision had operated for only a short period, during which the possibility that it might be triggered lay largely within the control of the employee who would be adversely affected. It had no business or commercial purpose, Barclays Mercantile Business Finance Ltd v Mawson (Inspector of Taxes) [2004] UKHL 51, [2005] 1 A.C. 684 and Scottish Provident Institution v Inland Revenue Commissioners [2004] UKHL 52, [2004] 1 W.L.R. 3172 applied. The conditions were to be disregarded for the purpose of deciding whether the shares were restricted securities, Furniss (Inspector of Taxes) v Dawson [1984] A.C. 474 applied (paras 86-89). The employees therefore fell to be taxed in respect of their receipt of the shares in accordance with ordinary taxation principles. The shares could not be valued for income tax purposes without regard to the conditions. The conditions had reduced the shares&#8217; value on the date of acquisition by a small amount. Value had to be assessed as at the date of acquisition, taking the conditions into account (paras 90-95).</p></div></div> </div>

In the instant case, even if H&#8217;s conduct might have been foreseen by the local authority, foreseeability was not the relevant test. In deciding whether H was a licensee, the question was not whether his activity or similar activities might have been foreseen, but whether they had been impliedly consented to by the local authority. There was no evidence to support such a finding. When a local authority licensed the public to use its land for recreational purposes, it was consenting to normal recreational activities, carrying normal risks. An implied licence for general recreational activity could not be stretched to cover any form of activity, however reckless. The judge&#8217;s conclusion, that at the time of the accident H was a &#8220;visitor&#8221; for the purposes of the Act, was therefore wrong. The local authority&#8217;s implied licence had not extended to what H was doing on its land and did not found liability under the Act.</p></div></div> </div>

P engaged in the climbing activity of his own free will and the risk of falling was plainly obvious. The judge effectively held that it was not obvious that there was a risk that the matting might not always protect a climber from serious injury. That finding was not sustainable, since it was quite obvious that no amount of matting would avoid the possibility of injury from an awkward fall. There was an inherent risk in the activity that P voluntarily undertook. The law did not require C to prevent P from engaging in the activity and nor was it required to train or supervise him whilst he did it. If the law required training or supervision in the instant case, it would equally be required for a multitude of other commonplace leisure activities which nevertheless carried with them a degree of obvious inherent risk.

Its recommendations had been properly implemented. If it started to rain during a break, there would be a delay before a wet-weather sign was placed by the fire doors, and a small amount of water could be deposited on the hall floor during that gap. On the day in question that was what probably happened. The law did not require an occupier of premises to take measures which would absolutely prevent any accident from ever occurring; all that was required was the exercise of reasonable care. The judge had made primary findings of fact and had evaluated those facts. He had not erred in his evaluation, so there was no reason to interfere with it (see paras 22-31 of judgment). (2) The evidence did not show that liquid gathering on the floor was a frequent problem or that there needed to be a special system for mopping it up. It was not realistic to expect the school to have a system in place for spotting and removing a small area of water during a brief period of time between the start of rain and the production of the wet-weather signs (paras 33-38).</p></div></div> </div>

The hazard at the edge of the path had not developed within minutes or hours or even days. Nor was it the kind of hazard, such as the risk of branches dropping from trees, which required a professional risk assessment, Bowen v National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty [2011] EWHC 1992 (QB) considered. The drop at the edge of the path was obvious and had not been detected by the manager of the accommodation or the caretaker. The local authority relied on what was said in Clerk and Lindsell and on a disability discrimination audit which had not found anything wrong with the path. However, Clerk and Lindsell was not a checklist, and no one knew what the state of the path and surrounding area had been when the audit was carried out. The local authority said that the judge had not carried out the balancing exercise required by Beaton v Devon CC [2002] EWCA Civ 1675, (2003) 100(1) L.S.G. 26, but that case did not lay down any general principle. Each case turned on its own facts. It was a point in favour of the local authority that there had been no previous accident, but on the other hand the hazard had been rectified after the accident without difficulty or expense. The question for the judge was whether before the accident it was foreseeable that someone would inadvertently step off the path and lose their balance because of the drop. It could not possibly be said that the judge was wrong to find that that was foreseeable and to go on to find that the local authority had not taken such care as was reasonable in all the circumstances to see that visitors were reasonably safe.

The answer was yes. There was no evidence that the water fountain was not reasonably safe. The edge could not be described as sharp, but even if it was sharp it could not be said to constitute a danger to children. The school was not under a duty to safeguard children from harm under all circumstances. The school was no more obliged as an occupier to take such steps in respect of the water fountain than it would be in respect of any of the other numerous edges, corners or surfaces against which children might accidentally injure themselves while on the premises (see paras 12, 17-18 of judgment).</p></div></div> </div>

His interpretation of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 s.28(4) was probably correct, and was one that was shared by other experienced tax specialists. Although the solicitor had failed to warn the client about the possibility of HMRC challenging the scheme, and the risk of it not being upheld in ensuing litigation, the client had expressed his understanding of the inherent risks in tax planning schemes.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Claim dismissed.<p>(1) Whether a warning of an alternative interpretation of a scheme such as that in issue was required depended entirely on the circumstances, and in particular whether there were strong factors favouring an alternative interpretation, Dixey &amp; Sons v Parsons considered, Herrmann v Withers LLP [2012] EWHC 1492 (Ch), [2012] 4 Costs L.R. 712 and Matrix Securities Ltd v Theodore Goddard [1998] S.T.C. 1 applied (see paras 127, 136-138, 146-147 of judgment).</p><p>(2) The claimant&#8217;s interpretation of s.28(4) was not obvious or likely because it would have the effect that s.28(4)(a) would exclude someone who was a participator at the date of the transfer of value into the trust, whereas s.28(4)(c) was clearly intended to cover a person who was a participator at the time of such a transfer; moreover, s.28(4)(d) would not cover someone who was not a connected person at the time of the transfer but became so connected afterwards. However, several experienced tax specialists had independently interpreted s.28(4) in the same way as the defendant without apparently considering that there was a likely alternative construction. Therefore, the defendant was not in breach of his duty of care in taking the view that the scheme satisfied the conditions of s.28 or in failing to warn the claimant that there was a risk that it would not be effective to avoid his tax liability unless his family were excluded from benefits even after his death (paras 155-159, 165-166, 168, 242).</p><p>(3) Any competent tax solicitor putting forward such a scheme to their clients in 1998 would have given a general warning that, since the scheme was one which involved tax avoidance, there was the possibility of a challenge by HMRC and a risk that the scheme would not be upheld in any ensuing litigation. To that extent, the defendant was in breach of his duty of care. However, since the claimant would not have been deterred from entering into the employee benefit trust if he had received such a warning, the defendant&#8217;s breach of duty had not caused the claimant any loss (paras 173-174, 181).</p><p>(4) If that conclusion were wrong, the claim would not have been out of time because, for the purposes of the Limitation Act 1980 s.14A, the claimant did not have actual or constructive knowledge before the three-year period prior to the bringing of his claim that he had suffered damage when entering into the deed of gift (paras 182-184, 193).</p><p>(5) Had he not entered into the employee benefit trust, the claimant would probably have entered into the private unit trust, since he was keen to avoid a very substantial tax liability and had actively considered that as an alternative. A challenge to the private unit trust scheme was unlikely to have succeeded. Had the defendant been found liable, the claimant would have been entitled to recover 70% of the settlement figure and the foreseeable expenditure of professional fees and costs incurred in dismantling the scheme (paras 200, 216, 223, 228, 242).</p></div></div> </div>

That was a matter of evaluation: the court should only interfere if the judge applied some wrong principle, failed to take a relevant matter into account, took an irrelevant matter into account or was plainly wrong, Assicurazioni Generali SpA v Arab Insurance Group (BSC) [2002] EWCA Civ 1642, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 577 applied. In the instant case, the judge had been plainly wrong: if a company was given every opportunity to show that it could pay a defendant&#8217;s costs and deliberately refused, there was every reason to believe that, if and when it was required to pay a defendant&#8217;s costs, it would be unable to do so. Even if deliberate reticence to reveal a company&#8217;s financial position was not a breach of CPR r.1.3, the court should take account of that as part of the overall picture. If, therefore, there were to be a practice of the Commercial Court that security for costs would often be granted against a foreign company who was not obliged to publish accounts, had no discernible assets and declined to reveal anything about its financial position, the practice was a sound one which should be upheld, Mbasogo v Logo [2006] EWCA Civ 608 applied (see paras 11-13, 17, 19-20 of judgment). (2) If the claimant were to lose in the instant proceedings, then the supplier will have won against the defendant, who would have to pay the supplier&#8217;s costs. It was highly likely that the defendant would be entitled to recover those costs from the claimant, as well as its own costs in both proceedings. Those costs then became the defendant&#8217;s own costs, for which it ought to be able to obtain security if it was fair to speak of them as being added to the defendant&#8217;s costs, as it was in the instant case, Johnson v Ribbins [1977] 1 W.L.R. 1458 applied. Accordingly, the decision to include the defendant&#8217;s own costs in an order for security was upheld, but the exclusion of the supplier&#8217;s costs was reversed. An order that the claimant should provide security for costs in the agreed sum was made (paras 25-26, 30). (3) Although a costs budget set out incurred and estimated costs, under CPR PD 3E para.7.4 the court only formally approved the estimated costs; and it was only in relation to those costs that the court would not depart from the approved budget &#8220;unless satisfied that there is good reason to do so&#8221; under CPR r.3.18(b). However, the court could still comment on the incurred costs element of costs budgets, as well as take them into account when considering the reasonableness and proportionality of estimated costs. Those comments will carry significant weight when exercising its general discretion as to costs at the end of a trial. Therefore, the practical effect of a comment on already incurred costs might be similar to the effect of formal approval of estimated costs in a cost budget. In the instant case, the judge had been correct to take an approved costs budget as the reference point to work out the defendant&#8217;s own costs which should be provided by way of security, and the supplier&#8217;s costs budget as the reference point for calculating its costs which were to be passed on to the defendant and recovered from the claimant (paras 41-43, 47, 49).</p></div></div> </div>

(2) In the present case, S owed a duty of care to the general public, including H but that duty was to take care not to negligently inflict a fresh injury; there were neither averments that S had made matters worse or that they had inflicted a fresh injury when they had arrived at, and dealt with, the fire, nor of circumstances which could properly be categorised as an assumption of responsibility giving rise to a common law duty to exercise reasonable care, and further, it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose a duty of care of the scope contended for by H on S, thus H&#8217;s case would necessarily fail even were all their averments proved, and the case as pled was irrelevant. Observed , per Lord Drummond Young, (1) that a distinction might properly be drawn between injury to the person and damage to property, consequently, it was hoped that in an appropriate case the law might develop in such a way that, at least in clear cases where action could be taken without danger to the rescuer, the officers of a public service such as the fire service or the police were obliged to take action to rescue persons in danger; (2) that the law had moved in the direction of attaching greater significance to the more traditional categorisation of distinct and recognisable situations as guides to the existence, scope and limits of the varied duties of care which the law imposed but rules derived from existing case law ought not to be applied mechanically to new situations, instead it should be asked whether, as a matter of policy directed to the specific situation under consideration, a new analysis was required, which would result in a law of negligence that was less unified than in the past but which dealt more fairly with individual cases.</p></div></div> </div>

Under the Act, a local authority had not been liable to a visitor to its leisure centre for injuries sustained in the course of using gymnasium equipment where the authority had entered into a maintenance service agreement with a third party for the maintenance of the equipment and that third party had recently carried out an inspection of the equipment.</p><p>The appellant local authority (S) appealed against a decision that it was liable for injuries sustained by the respondent (M) in an accident at a leisure centre operated by it. The gymnasium at the leisure centre had comprised a number of machines, including an uphill climbing machine. All the machines were manufactured by a company in America, and the second defendant (P) was the seller and maintenance provider for them. S had entered into a maintenance service agreement with P in respect of the machines; however, before completion of the agreement could take place, an engineer from P had carried out a pre contractual inspection. No defects had been found in the relevant machine and the contract was duly entered. A little over a month later M was using the climbing machine when the resistance of the machine gave in, causing M to fall backwards and injure himself. On a claim for damages for the injuries sustained the trial judge held both S and P to blame. The judge found that S had been in breach of an implied term of contract between it and M, since M was a paying entrant to the leisure centre, and further found that S had been in breach of its common duty of care under the Occupiers&#8217; Liability Act 1957 by failing to put into place a system of checking the safety of the equipment in the gymnasium. S argued that (1) the judge had erred in applying a different standard of care on the ground of an implied contractual term rather than the duty owed under the Act; (2) under the Act the judge had erred in finding that S had been in breach of its duty of care in light of the service agreement with P.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that (1) it was clear that s.5 of the Act was meant to do away with the previous common law distinction between an occupier&#8217;s liability towards a non contractual visitor and a visitor entering under a contract. Accordingly, the judge had erred by seeking to draw a distinction between S&#8217;s liability as an occupier to M as a contracting party and its liability as an occupier under the Act. (2) S was entitled to rely upon P as the expert to perform a proper inspection of the relevant machine at the pre contractual inspection. The reason for the pre contractual inspection was to ensure that the machine was in good order, and notwithstanding the lack of any contractual obligations existing at that time, P was at risk to subsequent users of the machine. S was entitled to consider that it had employed experts and had taken proper steps by entering into the service contract so as to meet its duties under the Act. There was nothing in the evidence to support a finding that S could be criticised for failing to inspect or maintain the machines or that it should have been aware of the defect. Accordingly there was no substance in the finding of liability under the Act.</div></div> </div>

Swimming in the lake was prohibited and the local authority had erected notices and distributed leaflets warning of the dangers of swimming in the lake. It was accepted that the relevant statutory duty was that owed to a trespasser under the 1984 Act and not the duty owed to a lawful visitor under the Occupiers&#8217; Liability Act 1957 s.2(2) because, by virtue of the prohibition on swimming, when T had entered the water to swim he had become a trespasser. T argued that the local authority had owed him a duty under s.1(4) of the 1984 Act to take such care as was reasonable in all the circumstances to ensure that he did not suffer injury on the premises by reason of the danger concerned.

Even if swimming had not been prohibited and the local authority had owed a duty under s.2(2) of the 1957 Act, it would not have been required to take steps to prevent T from diving or to warn him against dangers which were obvious, Donoghue v Folkestone Properties Ltd [2003] EWCA Civ 231 and Taylor v Glasgow City Council [1922] 1 A.C. 44 applied.

After midnight in late December D dived from a slipway in the harbour and broke his neck after hitting a grid pile located some two feet below the surface of the water. F argued that the duty that was owed to offer some protection to a trespasser against a danger extended only to the time or times at which the occupier had reasonable grounds for believing that the trespasser might be in the vicinity of and at risk from the danger. Accordingly, since there had been no reasonable grounds for believing that anyone would be swimming in the vicinity of the slipway at night in mid winter, it had owed no duty to D at the time of his accident.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that (1) it was arguable that an injury suffered by a trespasser as a result of a concealed obstruction below what appeared to be deep water could be attributed, in part, to the &#8220;state of the premises&#8221; for the purposes of s.1(1)(a) of the Act, and (2) while consideration of a class of trespasser might be useful when approaching the question raised by s.1(3)(b) of whether the occupier had reasonable grounds for believing that the trespasser might come into the vicinity of the danger, it would be necessary to consider whether any duty was owed to the particular member of the class who suffered the injury. A duty to offer some protection to children known to be in the vicinity of the danger might, for example, exist in circumstances where the occupier could not reasonably be expected to offer any protection to an adult. The question of whether a duty of care existed under the 1984 Act had to be determined with reference to the circumstances prevailing at the time that it was alleged that the breach of duty caused injury to the claimant. At the time that D had sustained his injuries, F had had no reason to believe that he would be diving from the slipway and the criterion of s.1(3)(b) had not been satisfied, Ratcliff v McConnell [1999] 1 W.L.R. 670 and White v St Albans City and District Council Times, March 12, 1990 applied and Tomlinson v Congleton BC [2002] EWCA Civ 309 considered.</div></div> </div>

If there was a danger attributable to the state of the premises, thus giving rise to a potential duty, the content of the duty might vary according to whether the trespasser was a child or an adult, but until that point was reached, then in the general run of cases, the age of the trespasser was not relevant.</p><p>The appellant healthcare trust appealed against the county court decision that it was liable for the personal injuries suffered by the respondent trespasser (K). K had been 11 years old at the time of the accident. He had been climbing the underside of a fire escape at the trust&#8217;s hospital premises when he fell to ground and was injured. The fire escape went to the top (third) floor of the building. It was in part of the hospital grounds that were used by the public as a means of going between the streets on either side. The judge held that there existed a danger due to the state of the premises within the Occupiers&#8217; Liability Act 1984 s.1(1)(a) . He held that K was two thirds responsible for what had happened. The trust submitted that the fire escape was not itself dangerous and that any danger was due to K&#8217;s activity on the premises and not the state of the premises. K submitted that there was danger due to the state of the premises &#8220;as found by&#8221; K, since the fire escape was amenable to being climbed from the outside with a consequent risk of harm from falling from a height and constituted an inducement to children habitually playing in the grounds of the hospital.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that (1) the authorities would conclude the question in favour of the trust if K was an adult, Donoghue v Folkestone Properties Ltd [2003] EWCA Civ 231 and Tomlinson v Congleton BC [2003] UKHL 47 considered. Premises that were not dangerous from the point of view of an adult could be dangerous for a child and whether they were was a question of fact and degree. However, it would not be right to ignore a child&#8217;s choice to indulge in a dangerous activity in every case merely because he was a child. The judge had found that K had not only appreciated that there was a risk of falling but also that what he was doing was dangerous and that he should not have been climbing the exterior of the fire escape. In the circumstances, it could not be said that K did not recognise the danger, and the risk arose not out of the state of the premises, which were as one would expect them to be, but out of what K chose to do, Young v Kent CC [2005] EWHC 1342 considered. Therefore, K had not suffered injury by reason of any danger due to the state of the premises and did not pass the threshold requirement in s.1(1)(a) of the 1984 Act. (2) If there could be said to have been a risk by reason of a danger due to the state of the premises and the risk could be said to have arisen because the fire escape was unguarded or unfenced, K could have brought himself within s.1(3)(a) of the 1984 Act because the trust knew that the fire escape was unguarded and unfenced. K could also bring himself within s.1(3)(b), since the trust knew that children played in the vicinity of the unguarded or unfenced fire escape. It was doubtful whether K could have brought himself within s.1(3)(c) because it would not be reasonable to expect the trust to offer protection from such a risk.</div></div> </div>

Properties which had been vacated were secured against intruders with metal sheets over windows and doors, and L&#8217;s employees routinely checked premises to see whether the shuttering had become insecure. On August 21, 1995 an employee of L found that the shutters at 2 Newlands Close were insecure and, on inspection, the property was found to be so badly vandalised that it needed to be demolished. Since that would take about a week L erected an eight foot high corrugated metal fence around the property, secured by wooded posts fixed in concrete. The next day a group of four boys gained entrance to the property and, whilst they were inside, the building collapsed, killing P and injuring K. P&#8217;s father and K sued L under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 , Fatal Accidents Act 1976 and in damages for personal injuries. The trial judge found in favour of L on the issue of liability.

At the time the boys entered the property it was surrounded by an eight foot fence which could be overcome only by climbing over it or wriggling under it through an eight inch gap and there was no evidence that on any previous occasion any child had done either of those things. To say that by providing such a fence L did not take such care as was reasonable in all the circumstances of the case to see that these four boys did not suffer injury on the premises would be absurd.</div></div> </div>

(2) M had pled a relevant common law case against S and were entitled to a proof: the duty cast on S was said to have been to take reasonable care in the performance of their work as environmental consultants for the safety of those whom they knew would occupy the houses to be built on the land, that it was their responsibility to investigate for contamination and to remediate, and in the circumstances of this case, it was not arguable that it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose such a duty of care on S, Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2008] CSIH 19, 2008 S.C. 351, distinguished ; it would not be possible until after proof to determine the precise nature and extent of S&#8217;s duties to M over the entire period of S&#8217;s involvement in the development but M had averred enough to entitle them to an inquiry. (3) M&#8217;s case against L fell to be dismissed: in so far as M&#8217;s case relied on the provisions of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, it was based on a misconstruction of the implied terms on which they founded, statutory and common law made it clear that a landlord&#8217;s obligations related to the repair of the fabric of the let property itself, in respect of which M had averred no defect; thereafter in respect of the alleged breach of statutory duty in the context of the 2001 Act, there was no averment that before the commencement of the Scottish secure tenancy or of when M became joint tenants, that L had failed to ensure that the house was reasonably fit for human habitation. (4) M&#8217;s contention that either C or S were in breach of s.33(1) of the 1990 Act had to be rejected: M had offered to prove, and had relevantly averred, that the ash, slag, volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, and the ground contaminated thereby, in the part of the site where M&#8217;s homes were built was controlled waste for the purposes of Pt II of the Act, but M was specific about the dates when such waste was redistributed, namely the first quarters of 1993 and 1994, following the completion of which, S had issued a certificate of substantial completion in respect of which M contended that an act of deposit continued indefinitely but the contention that s.33(1) applied to a continuing state of affairs was misplaced, Thames Waste Management Ltd v Surrey CC [1997] Env. L.R. 148, considered . (5) M&#8217;s averments of causation were sufficient to entitle them to lead evidence to the effect that they had each suffered injury to their health as a result of the inhalation of solvents which, but for S&#8217;s fault, would have been discovered and removed before their homes were built. (6) On the time bar issue, M&#8217;s position was that neither had been aware until sometime after September 2009 that their injuries were attributable in whole, or in part, to an act or omission thus on the face of it, their right of action had expired and if postponement of the commencement of the triennium were to be put in issue, it would be for M to do so by asserting that it would not have been reasonably practicable to have become aware that their injuries were attributable, in whole or in part, to an act or omission so that the defenders would be given an opportunity to assert the contrary; it might be that all M required to add was a formal averment to the effect that it would not have been reasonably practicable for them to have acquired knowledge that the injuries were caused by an act or omission until a date falling after September 2009, and the case would be put out by order to allow M&#8217;s advisers the opportunity to consider the sufficiency of their pleadings.</p></div></div> </div>

Reporting restrictions orders in serious medical treatment cases could extend beyond the death of the subject of those proceedings. There was no presumption or default position that such orders should end when the subject died, Meek, Re [2014] EWCOP 1, [2014] C.O.P.L.R. 535 and Press Association v Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals Foundation Trust [2014] EWCOP 6, [2014] C.O.P.L.R. 502 applied (see paras 9.1, 9.11, 98-108, 144-145 of judgment).</p><p>(2) The duration of the order would be &#8220;until further order of the court&#8221;. There was no reason to order that reporting restrictions should terminate on the youngest daughter&#8217;s 18th birthday, as submitted by the respondent media organisations, as the two adult daughters also had valid art.8 rights which were engaged (paras 9.2, 9.14, 110-118, 142-143,167-169, 178-180).</p><p>(3) Balancing art.8 and art.10 was a case-sensitive exercise. Care should be taken in transporting comment on the weight of rival factors from one type of case to another, S (A Child) (Identification: Restrictions on Publication), Re [2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 A.C. 593 applied and C v Secretary of State for Justice [2016] UKSC 2, [2016] 1 W.L.R. 444 considered (paras 9.3, 43, 69-73).</p><p>(4) The first step was to consider whether there was a good reason for a public hearing. That was not an isolated or preliminary stage that, if such a good reason existed, would found an approach that the second stage was addressed on the premise the Court of Protection proceedings were treated in the same way as other proceedings where the default rule was that they were heard in public (para.9.4, 79-80, 90).</p><p>(5) The default rule that Court of Protection hearings were held in private represented a general conclusion on how best to administer justice. Neither art.8 nor art.10 took precedence so it would be wrong to approach the default rule as creating a presumption. Rather it was part of the structure for a reasoning process which applied the approach in S (A Child) to a given case (paras 9.5, 80, 91-92).</p><p>(6) In most cases, the important safeguards secured by a public hearing could be secured without identifying the people involved. Generally the court should ask (a) whether there were good reasons for a public hearing; (b) if so, whether there should be reporting restrictions; (c) how effective restrictions might be in promoting art 8 rights and how restrictive they would be of art.10 rights; (d) if the hearing was to be in public, what reporting restrictions should be imposed, and if the hearing was to be in private, what documents should be made public (paras 9.6, 9.7, 84-85, 96).</p><p>(7) Hearings would almost always be in public because of the benefits of open justice (paras 9.8, 97).</p><p>(8) Owing to the rival propositions relating to anonymisation, the court had to distinguish between cases falling within the default position of allowing media access, and cases where media access was restricted. The weight to be given to the general propositions regarding naming, and the court&#8217;s conclusion about what best promoted the administration of justice in any given case, would vary. They would often be taken into account in the context of (a) the validity of the reasons for the application, and (b) the impact of departing from the general conclusion on what generally promoted the administration of justice. Those reasons and that impact would need to be identified (paras 9.9, 9.10, 78, 95).</p><p>(9) In the instant case it should have been clear to anyone with compassion that the focus of the reporting would, and did, add greatly to the distress of the deceased&#8217;s daughters, one of whom was still at school. Much of the publicity had been precipitated by a wish not only to report the bases on which the court reached its decision, but to attract prurient interest in the deceased&#8217;s sexual and relationship history. It was obvious that naming or otherwise identifying the deceased would increase the family&#8217;s distress. Their art.8 rights were engaged, not least because the investigatory jurisdiction of the Court of Protection had invaded their private and family lives. (para.9.13, 29-35, 43, 74-77, 130-143).</p></div></div> </div>

Since the decision in X v Bedfordshire , which had been reached on policy grounds, JD v East Berkshire had reviewed the impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 on the common law principles of negligence and had determined that when considering a child&#8217;s claim in negligence the court had to take into account their rights under the ECHR. Further, following developments in domestic jurisprudence, the effect of the X v Bedfordshire case was restricted to the core proposition that decisions by a local authority whether or not to take a child into care were not reviewable by way of a claim in negligence, JD v East Berkshire followed. The references to JD v East Berkshire in para.7 of Mitchell and in Michael were all to the appeals of the parents and did not affect the dicta of the Court of Appeal in the cases concerning the children, except for para.191 in Michael where in the dissenting judgment of Baroness Hale she had accepted that JD v East Berkshire provided an exception to the general rule that public authorities which failed to perform their duties did not owe a duty of care in negligence towards individuals who suffered harm thereby. As neither Mitchell nor Michael had implicitly overruled JD v East Berkshire, it remained binding authority, Mitchell and Michael considered.

C, who was 13 months old at the time, was injured when he ingested dishwasher powder from a plastic bottle. The powder had been purchased from the first appellant, but the bottle had been manufactured by the second appellant. The claim against T was that the bottle and cap had been defective so that the cap was easier to detach than it should have been. The cap was a child resistant closure (CRC) cap. T joined C&#8217;s mother (P) to the action on the basis of their claim that she had left the bottle in a place where C could see and reach it, and had left the cap off or not properly screwed up. The judge found T liable and acquitted P of any negligence. The judge held that, having elected to fit a CRC cap to the bottle, the consumer was entitled to expect the cap to function at least up to the standard usually to be applied to CRCs, namely the British Standard certificate. He held that there was a defect in the cap for a number of reasons, in particular that there had been play between the cap and screw and very much less torque was required to open it. He accordingly held T liable in negligence at common law and under the Consumer Protection Act 1987 . T argued that the judge had erred in finding them liable. In the event that the appeal was allowed, C, challenging the judge&#8217;s exoneration of P, argued that (1) it must have been foreseeable that a child would be liable to suffer injury if he got access to the contents of the bottle; (2) under the 1987 Act, the public was entitled to expect that the product would function to the full extent of the design standard to which it was manufactured, which in the instant case meant the same as compliance with the British Standard torque measure. C submitted that given that a CRC cap was advisedly put onto the bottle design for safety reasons, s.3 of the 1987 Act sufficed to import the British Standard torque measure into the content of general public expectation.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross appeal, that (1) this was a case of breach of statutory duty or nothing. One aspect of the factual scenario which, having exonerated P, the judge accepted, was that it was surely not reasonably foreseeable that this injury would happen as he found it did. In a case such as the instant, any calculation of foreseeability had to assume that the child&#8217;s parents would take steps in the home to prevent the child having access to the bottle. Every case must be judged by the colour of its own facts and, in the instant case, foreseeability could not be got out of the fact that it proved possible for C to open the bottle coupled with the fact that the British Standard certificate was not met. Accordingly, the case turned upon whether there was a breach of the 1987 Act. (2) The test as to whether a product had a defect under the 1987 Act was what persons generally were entitled to expect. Persons were generally entitled to expect that the bottle in the instant case would be more difficult to open than if it had an ordinary screwtop. Anything more specific, as a test of public expectation, ran into difficulties. The bottle was more difficult to open than an ordinary screwtop, though not as difficult as it would have been if the British Standard torque measure had been complied with. Thus, there was no breach of the 1987 Act. (3) The judge was entitled to accept P&#8217;s account of events and he was entitled to reach his conclusions as to the way the accident happened.</div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-893'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Consumer Law - Damages - Defective Products - Defects - Hip Joint - Issues - Medical Equipment</div><div class='details details-facts'><p>defective products; medical equipment; defects in hip prosthesis; time when damage occurred</p><p>The appellant (P) appealed against a decision dismissing his claim for damages against the respondent prosthetics manufacturer (J). P had had a total hip replacement operation that involved the implantation of a prosthesis supplied by J. After the operation, the prosthesis sheared in two and it had to be removed and replaced, which resulted in P losing a significant amount of mobility. P brought an action for damages claiming that J was strictly liable under the Consumer Protection Act 1987 . On examination of the prosthesis after it was removed, two defects were found. At trial, it was J&#8217;s case that their manufacturing and inspection process was such that the prosthesis had no defect when they supplied it to the hospital, and it was most likely that the defect occurred when the prosthesis was implanted. It was P&#8217;s case that the defects found on examination of the prosthesis after the fracture were caused during the explantation of the prosthesis, and those defects or at least one of them had covered up a pre-existing surface point defect which had initiated the fracture, and which had been present prior to implantation. The trial judge&#8217;s conclusion was that it was not possible to say precisely when the damage to the prosthesis was caused, but that the more likely time would have been at explantation rather than implantation. The judge found that the prosthesis left J&#8217;s factory without any defects, so that J succeeded in establishing the statutory defence under s.4 of the 1987 Act. P submitted that (1) the judge had erred in his analysis of the evidence in reaching his determination based on the evidence as to the surface point defect and manufacturing process; (2) the judge should have considered P&#8217;s alternative case that J had produced a prosthesis which was defective in that a surface point defect, capable of initiating a fracture, could be caused during the ordinary course of implantation.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that (1) any imperfections which arose during the machining and polishing process would have been identified at or before the final inspection process. On a visual inspection, a surface defect of 35 microns or more could be detected. There was no evidence to suggest that the surface point defect that initiated the fracture was smaller than 35 microns; therefore the system was capable of detecting the defect. It could be inferred that the defect would have been detected had it been present prior to delivery at the hospital. The judge had been correct to find that the prosthesis was not defective at the time it was supplied to the hospital. (2) P had raised his alternative case in the pleadings, but had not pursued it because the judge had indicated that he was not impressed by it. It was important for parties to identify the issues to which the evidence was to be directed and in relation to which the trial was to be conducted. Once P chose not to pursue his alternative case, it was not incumbent on J to deal with it. The court, on appeal, could not deal with the issues raised in the alternative case.</div></div> </div>

L was a serving police officer who was in non contractual relationship with the Commissioner akin to that of employment. B had handled the arrangements for L&#8217;s transfer to another force. She had told him, in response to his specific inquiry, that his allowances would not be affected if he took time off work before starting with the new force. However, under the arrangements made by B, there was a break in the continuity of L&#8217;s service with the result that he did not retain the benefit of a housing allowance. L argued that, as a result of B&#8217;s failure to give proper advice, he had suffered loss of entitlement to the housing allowance and the Commissioner was vicariously liable for the handling of arrangements for his transfer. The judge held that the Commissioner had breached a duty of care owed to L to arrange the transfer, including the giving of advice, so as to ensure that he did not lose his allowances. The Commissioner submitted (1) the judge&#8217;s radical departure from the existing law; (2) B was not a professional adviser and was not under any positive duty to give L advice about the choice of a leaving date; (3) it was not fair, just or reasonable to impose on an employer a decision which involved a general duty of care to give advice to an employee in order to protect them from economic loss and the same reasoning should apply to the relationship between himself and L, Outram v Academy Plastics Ltd [2001] I.C.R. 367 cited. L argued that the judge had correctly applied the principle in Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd [1964] A.C. 465.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that (1) no new category of duty situation had been created by the judge&#8217;s decision. The particular facts found by the judge brought the case within the Hedley Byrne principle. It was well established that liability in tort for pure economic loss could arise from the negligent carrying out of a task undertaken pursuant to an express voluntary assumption of responsibility, on which L had relied, Hedley Byrne applied. (2) It did not matter that B was not a professional adviser, Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc [1995] 2 A.C. 296 applied, since she had expressly assumed responsibility in L&#8217;s transfer for giving him advice in relation to the loss of the housing allowance, which he had expressly raised with her. B had, or had access to, special complex knowledge concerning the effect of transfers on service allowances of that kind and she had led L to believe that he could leave it to her. She had not told him to seek advice elsewhere. Those features of the case were sufficient to attract a duty to give him advice in respect of the very type of loss about which he had expressed his concern to her and which he had actually suffered as a result of her failure to advise him. (3) L had not invoked a general contractual duty of care positively to give advice to protect him from economic loss, Outram v Academy Plastics distinguished. There was nothing in the case to prevent the Hedley Byrne principle from applying to an omission to give advice in the circumstances, even though the parties were in a relationship akin to that of employer and employee.</div></div> </div>

The law as stated by Denning L.J. in Fairey v Southampton CC [1956] 2 Q.B. 439 and Hobhouse L.J. in Secretary of State for the Environment v Beresford Trustees [1996] N.P.C. 128 was correct, Fairey and Beresford applied. The test was objective: the reasonable user would have to understand that the landowner was intending to disabuse him of the notion that the land was a public highway. Outside the criminal law and parts of the law of torts, it was common to use the word &#8220;intention&#8221; in an objective sense. The Court of Appeal had taken too narrow a view of the purpose and effect of the proviso. It had been drafted against the background of the common law. The presumption of dedication at common law involved a dialogue between the landowner and the public. A landowner had to communicate his intention to the public in some way if he was to satisfy the requirements of the proviso, Mann v Brodie (1885) 10 App. Cas. 378 considered and Folkstone Corp v Brockman [1914] A.C. 338 superseded. Furthermore, if an uncommunicated intention sufficed to satisfy the proviso, then the elaborate and time-consuming measures provided for in s.31(3) to s.31(6) would have no point. (2) The phrase &#8220;during that period&#8221; in the proviso to s.31(1) meant &#8220;at some point during that period&#8221;.

However, it was necessary to look at the statements made on the website as a whole, and those statements had included reference to an information pack supplied by S. S could reasonably have expected potential customers to have regard to all the information potentially available from the website and not just part of it, and to obtain an information pack. If P had asked for the information pack and the list of members referred to on the website, it would have become immediately apparent that C was not a full member and was not covered by the warranty scheme. In all the circumstances it could not fairly be held that S had assumed a legal responsibility to the claimants for the accuracy of the statements in its website without the further enquiry which the website itself had urged, Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd [1964] A.C. 465 and Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman [1990] 2 A.C. 605 considered. There had been no assumption of responsibility because the degree of reliance which S had intended or should reasonably have expected would be placed on the accuracy of the statements on its website was limited by the advice that potential customers should obtain an information pack. In the circumstances there had not been a sufficient relationship of proximity between S and P to give rise to a duty of care and it would not be fair, just and reasonable to hold that S had owed them a duty to take care, Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank Plc [2006] UKHL 28, [2007] 1 A.C. 181 followed. To hold that S had owed a duty of care to P would not be only a small increment or development from existing case law. The mere fact that the representations had been contained on a website did not support the conclusion that a duty of care was owed; all depended on the circumstances.</p></div></div> </div>

The lapse of time meant that there was no requirement to hold an inquiry under ECHR art.2. Further, such a duty could not be implied into common law under principles of customary international law and the decision not to hold an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 s.1 was not open to challenge on judicial review principles.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>(Lady Hale dissenting) (1) It was not open to the secretaries of state to assert that the acts of the British soldiers were not attributable to the UK. While on active service in Malaya, the soldiers remained under the command of the Crown. There was no question of their secondment to any other authority. The secretaries of state could not argue that any liabilities of the Crown had passed to the Federation of Malaya when it became independent in 1957. Even if responsibility for the deaths had transferred to the Federation under the Federal Constitution of 1957, that could not affect any domestic law duty which the UK would otherwise have towards victims of prior misconduct by the British army. The general rule was that state liability for a death remained with the state responsible for the deaths and did not pass to a state which took over the relevant territory or activities (see paras 178, 187-197 of judgment). (2) (Lord Kerr and Lady Hale agreeing that the art.2 claim should fail but dissenting in relation to when the critical date was) The ECHR did not bind a contracting party in relation to any act or fact which took place before the ECHR had entered into force with respect to that party (the &#8220;critical date&#8221;). However, according to the principles set out in Janowiec v Russia (55508/07) (2014) 58 E.H.R.R. 30 a duty to investigate could arise under art.2 where two criteria were satisfied. In the instant case, the first criterion was satisfied: there had been relevant &#8220;acts or omissions&#8221; after the critical date because there had been no full or public investigation of the killings and compelling evidence had come to light suggesting that they were unlawful. However, the second criterion had not been satisfied: there was no &#8220;genuine connection&#8221; between the deaths and the critical date. The critical date was 1966, when the UK first recognised the right to petition the European Court of Human Rights, rather than 1953 when the ECHR came into force in the UK. The killings occurred more than 10 years before the critical date and there was therefore no genuine connection, Janowiec , Silih v Slovenia (71463/01) (2009) 49 E.H.R.R. 37 and Varnava v Turkey (16064/90) (2010) 50 E.H.R.R. 21 applied. The claim under art.2 had to fail (paras 70-87). (3) By 1948, it had not been established that international law required a formal public investigation into a suspicious death, even if there were strong reasons for believing that a war crime had been committed. Even if such a duty had been imposed by customary international law, it had to be subject to a cut-off date and it was inconceivable that it could be treated as retrospective to events which occurred more than 40 years earlier. In any event, if international law did require such an investigation, that requirement could not be implied into the common law. Parliament had expressly provided for investigations into deaths through the coroners&#8217; courts and through the 2005 Act. It had also incorporated art.2 through the Human Rights Act 1998. In those circumstances, it would be inappropriate for the courts to impose a further duty to hold an inquiry, particularly with such potentially wide and uncertain ramifications, McKerr&#8217;s Application for Judicial Review, Re [2004] UKHL 12, [2004] 1 W.L.R. 807 applied (paras 112-122). (4) (Lady Hale dissenting) In exercising their statutory discretion under s.1 of the 2005 Act, the secretaries of state had clearly considered the request for an inquiry seriously and had rejected it for defensible and relevant reasons. It was impossible to characterise their conclusion as unreasonable or irrational. The decision could not be impugned. It was not appropriate to determine K&#8217;s arguments that the time had come to recognise proportionality, rather than rationality, as a basis for challenging administrative decisions. The issue had potentially profound and wide implications and would need to be argued before a panel of nine Justices. However, such a course was unnecessary because the appeal would fail even if it was based on proportionality (paras 127-129, 132). (Per Lady Hale) The decision not to hold an inquiry was not one which a reasonable authority could have reached. The secretaries of state had not taken account of all the possible purposes and benefits of such an inquiry. The value of establishing the truth was overwhelming (paras 309-313).</p></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-906'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Nuisance - Damages - Injunctions - Noise - Planning Permission - Prescription - Remedies</div><div class='details details-facts'><p>The Supreme Court set out the approach to be adopted when a court had to consider whether to award damages or grant an injunction in a nuisance case.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>(1) In the light of the relevant principles, practical considerations and judicial dicta, it was possible to obtain by prescription a right to commit what would otherwise be a nuisance by noise (see para.41 of judgment). (2) It was no defence for a defendant sued in nuisance to argue that the claimant came to the nuisance, although it might well be a defence, at least in some circumstances, for a defendant to argue that, as it was only because the claimant had changed the use of, or built on, his land that the defendant&#8217;s pre-existing activity was claimed to have become a nuisance, the claim should fail (para.58). (3) A defendant, faced with a contention that his activities gave rise to a nuisance, could rely on those activities as constituting part of the character of the locality, but only to the extent that they did not constitute a nuisance. Similarly, any other activity in the neighbourhood could properly be taken into account when assessing the character of the neighbourhood, to the extent that it did not give rise to an actionable nuisance or was otherwise unlawful (paras 74-75). (4) The mere fact that the activity which was said to give rise to the nuisance had the benefit of a planning permission would normally be of no assistance to the defendant in a claim brought by a neighbour who argued that the activity caused a nuisance to his land in the form of noise or other loss of amenity. Among other things, it was wrong in principle that, through the grant of a planning permission, a planning authority should be able to deprive a property-owner of a right to object to what would otherwise be a nuisance, without providing him with compensation, when there was no provision in the planning legislation which suggested such a possibility (paras 90, 94). (5) The court&#8217;s power to award damages in lieu of an injunction involved a classic exercise of discretion, which should not, as a matter of principle, be fettered, although the prima facie position was that an injunction should be granted. As to the four tests set out Shelfer v City of London Electric Lighting Co (No.1) [1895] 1 Ch. 287, their application should not be such as to fetter the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion. However, it would, in the absence of additional relevant circumstances pointing the other way, normally be right to refuse an injunction if those four tests were satisfied. But the fact that those tests were not all satisfied would not mean that an injunction should be granted, Shelfer considered. The public interest, if it arose, would be a relevant factor; for example, a court would be entitled to have regard to the fact that many other neighbours in addition to the claimant were badly affected by the nuisance as a factor in favour of granting an injunction. In some cases, the grant of planning permission for a particular activity might provide strong support for the contention that the activity was of benefit to the public, which would be relevant to the question of whether or not to grant an injunction (paras 120-121, 123-125). (6) The application of the above principles justified the restoration of the injunction granted by the judge at first instance. Among other things, C and M had not shown that their activities during a period of 20 years amounted to a nuisance. To justify the establishment of a right to create a noise by prescription, it was not enough to show that the activity which now created the noise had been carried on for 20 years. It was not even enough to show that the activity had created a noise for 20 years. What had to be established was that the activity had created a nuisance over 20 years. However, under the &#8220;permission to apply&#8221; provision in the judge&#8217;s order, C and M would be free to argue that the injunction should be discharged and damages awarded instead (paras 143, 148, 151).</p></div></div> </div>

P claimed damages against D, manufacturers of electrical components, alleging that in December 1964 metal foil strips blown from D&#8217;s factory on the same industrial estate as P&#8217;s factory came into contact with an electricity sub-station on the estate, causing a power failure which halted P&#8217;s machines, resulted in material in them solidifying, necessitated the cleaning of the machines, and wasted materials and time. P alleged D knew or ought to have known of the likely consequences of the escape because a similar occurrence had taken place in 1961 and D had received a warning from the electricity board. P claimed damages under four heads - (a) strict liability under Rylands v Fletcher (b)negligence; (c) nuisance; and (d) public nuisance. D contended that nothing more than a damnum absque injuria was revealed. On the trial of a preliminary issue whether on the facts set out in the statement of claim, D was in law liable for the damage claimed, held, (1) that the claim under head (a) failed because there was no non-natural user of the land; (2) as to (b) that D owed a duty to P in the circumstances to prevent the metal foil being blown about so as to foul the sub-station and that, as to remoteness of damage, there was no difference between the present case of alleged physical injury with consequential loss of profits and the ordinary case of a plaintiff suffering physical injury and losing earnings; and (3) that as to (c) and (d), an isolated happening by itself could create an actionable nuisance and so, as P was directly and foreseeably affected, P had a good cause of action against D in nuisance.

D, a husband and wife, applied for a declaration that noise emanating from a military base adjacent to their property constituted a nuisance and sought damages. D owned and lived on an estate adjacent to RAF Wittering, an operational aerodrome. Harrier squadrons trained at the military base and when landing flew directly over D&#8217;s estate. D claimed that the noise levels were deafening when the Harriers were in the course of circuit training, particularly as they flew over D&#8217;s estate at low altitude to land at the military base. D alleged that this constituted a nuisance at common law and/or infringed their human rights under the Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8 and Sch.1 Part II Art.1 and significantly reduced the market value of their estate. TheMoD argued that the flying activity was a necessary part of training pilots and was in the interests of national security and nothing could reasonably be done to improve the situation. The MoD claimed that in any event it had acquired the right to commit any nuisance by prescription since the harriers had been flying at the military base since 1969. The case raised the point of principle of whether and in what circumstances a sufficient public interest could amount to a defence to a claim in nuisance.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; granting the application in part, that whilst the noise emanating from the military base constituted a nuisance, the public interest demanded that the flying of the aircraft should continue. The flying of the harriers was not an ordinary use of land. Harrier training was only planned to continue at the base for a further nine years The defence of the realm and the cost and inconvenience of uprooting the military airbase meant that D&#8217;s private rights were subjugated to the public interest. Public interest was to be considered but selected individuals were not to bear the cost of the public benefit. It was not proportionate to give effect to the public interest without compensating D. There had been an interference with D&#8217;s human rights under Art.8 and Art.1 and an appropriate assessment of damages at common law would provide &#8220;just satisfaction&#8221; under the Human Rights Act 1998 s.8, Marcic v Thames Water Utilities Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 64, [2002] Q.B. 929 applied. Accordingly in this exceptional case damages assessed at GBP 950,000 were awarded for capital loss, loss of amenity and loss of commercial opportunities caused by the nuisance.

M&#8217;s property was regularly flooded by reason of overloaded sewers. The flooding was not due to any failure on T&#8217;s part to clean or maintain the sewers but was, rather, due to a significant increase in the volume of sewage entering the sewers since the time of their construction. T had no control over the volume of sewage entering the system.

That was so as much for the case of the transitory nuisance interfering with comfort and enjoyment of the land as it was for the case of the nuisance that occasioned permanent injury to the land and to its capital value, or other pecuniary loss. It was also clear that a claimant had to show that he had in truth suffered a loss of amenity before substantial damages could be awarded. The actual impact of the nuisance upon the occupiers of the land would in practice be relevant to the assessment of common law damages for loss of amenity in many cases, including such as the instant case where a family home was in question and no physical injury to the property, loss of capital value, loss of rent or other pecuniary damage, arose. Also none of the majority speeches in Canary Wharf supported the view that the person who had the right to sue in nuisance was recovering damages on behalf of other occupiers of the property. (2) Where a public authority had been found to have acted unlawfully, the court could grant such relief or remedy as it considered just and appropriate. No award of damages was to be made unless, taking account of all the circumstances including any other relief or remedy granted in relation to the same act, the court was satisfied that the award was necessary to afford just satisfaction under art.41 of the Convention. (3) The first of the judge&#8217;s three answers were reversed. An award of damages in nuisance to a person or persons with a proprietary interest in a property would be relevant to the question whether an award of damages was necessary to afford just satisfaction under art.8 to a person who lived in the same household but had no proprietary interest in the property. (4) As the judge had held, the availability of other remedies was relevant to the issue of whether damages were necessary to afford just satisfaction under s.8(3) of the 1998 Act. Under that provision, all circumstances had to be taken into account. (5) Despite the fact that damages for private nuisance were awarded as damage to &#8220;land&#8221;, it was highly improbable, if not inconceivable, that Strasbourg would think it appropriate or just or necessary to award a further sum on top for breach of art.8. Accordingly the award of damages at common law to a property owner would normally constitute just satisfaction to the owner for the purposes of s.8(3) of the 1998 Act and no additional award of compensation under that Act would normally be necessary.</p></div></div> </div>

The fact that a landlord had done nothing to stop or discourage the nuisance could not amount to participation.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Judgment accordingly.<p>(Carnwath and Mance JJ.S.C. dissenting on the issue of W&#8217;s liability) (1) The injunction ought to be suspended until the house was habitable. It was intended to prevent interference with ordinary residential use and enjoyment, and while such use and enjoyment was impossible, there was no justification for maintaining it (see paras 5-7, 49 of judgment). (2) The parties should have liberty to apply at any time to vary or discharge the injunction. The argument that it should be discharged on the ground that damages would be an adequate remedy now had some prospect of success. That provided a good reason, not in existence at the time of the original order, for allowing the parties to apply without delay (paras 8-9, 49). (3) A landlord was liable for his tenant&#8217;s nuisance where he had authorised it, either by actively and directly participating in it, or by letting the property in circumstances where there was a very high degree of probability that the letting would result in the nuisance, Southwark LBC v Mills [2001] 1 A.C. 1 followed. In the instant case, the nuisance had not been an inevitable, or almost certain, consequence of the letting. It was not enough that W had known how C and M would use the premises and that the use had resulted in nuisance. The use could have been carried on without nuisance to L. Nor had W actively or directly participated in the nuisance. There was little authority on the issue, but whether a landlord had directly participated in a nuisance was largely a question of fact for the trial judge. The question turned principally on events subsequent to the grant of the lease, though it might take colour from the nature and circumstances of the grant and what preceded it. None of the factors relied on by L were sufficient to establish that W had participated in the nuisance. The fact that a landlord had done nothing to stop or discourage the nuisance could not amount to participation, Malzy v Eicholz [1916] 2 K.B. 308 applied. Moreover, absent very unusual circumstances, a landlord&#8217;s failure to take steps to mitigate a nuisance could not create an inference that he had authorised it. Nor could it be said that a landlord, by attempting to fight off allegations of nuisance against his tenant, was participating in or authorising the nuisance. Although the judge&#8217;s dismissal of L&#8217;s claim against W would be upheld, there would be no order for costs against L. W had succeeded on a basis that was different from the judge&#8217;s and which had neither been pleaded nor argued at first instance (paras 11-12, 15-26, 31, 49). (4) L&#8217;s costs at first instance consisted of base costs, a success fee and an after the event insurance premium. The costs order required C and M to pay 60 per cent of all three elements. It was open to the instant court to consider whether the costs regime in the Access to Justice Act 1999, and in particular a claimant&#8217;s right to recover any success fee and ATE premium from an unsuccessful defendant, infringed the Convention, James v United Kingdom (A/98) (1986) 8 E.H.R.R. 123, MGN Ltd v United Kingdom (39401/04) [2011] 1 Costs L.O. 84 and Dombo Beheer BV v Netherlands (A/274-A) (1994) 18 E.H.R.R. 213 considered. While C and M&#8217;s liability for the costs might be inconsistent with their rights under art.6 or Protocol 1 art.1, it would be wrong for the court to decide the point without giving the government the opportunity to make representations. If the costs order infringed, the proper outcome might be to grant a declaration of incompatibility. However, that would be questionable given that the relevant provisions of the 1999 Act and the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 had been repealed and replaced. If C and M wished to pursue the matter, the instant appeal would have to be re-listed for hearing once appropriate notice had been given to the Attorney General and the Secretary of State for Justice (paras 32-34, 40-44, 49).</p></div></div> </div>

There was no basis for using a statutory scheme to cut down private law rights and, in any event, the permit did not authorise the emission of such smells.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed, cross-appeal dismissed.<p>(1) TThe judge saw the concept of &#8220;reasonable user&#8221; as an important part of the argument for taking account of the statutory scheme and the permit. An activity which was conducted in contravention of planning or environmental control was unlikely to be reasonable, but the converse did not follow, Watson v Croft Promo-Sport Ltd [2009] EWCA Civ 15, [2009] 3 All E.R. 249 considered. &#8220;Reasonable user&#8221; was at most a different way of describing old principles, not an excuse for reinventing them, Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather Plc [1994] 2 A.C. 264 and Bamford v Turnley 122 E.R. 27 considered. The permit was neither strategic in nature nor did it change the essential character of the neighbourhood, which had long included tipping. The only change was the introduction of a more offensive form of waste, producing a new type of smell emission. The permit did not, and did not purport to, authorise the emission of such smells. Even if compliance with a statutory permit was capable of being a relevant factor, it was for a defendant to prove compliance (see paras 46, 64-67, 71, 76-77 of judgment). (2) The common law of nuisance had co-existed with statutory controls since the nineteenth century. There was no principle that it should march with a statutory scheme covering similar subject matter. Short of express or implied statutory authority to commit a nuisance, there was no basis, in principle or authority, for using such a statutory scheme to cut down private law rights, Cambridge Water considered. Further, if there was a problem in meeting a need within the existing legal framework, its solution had to rest with the legislature and Parliament had not yet chosen to provide statutory immunity from common law nuisance claims for waste sites provided in accordance with Directive 2006/12, Metropolitan Asylum District Managers v Hill (No.2) (1881) 6 App. Cas. 193 applied (paras 46, 94-102, 106). (3) There was no general rule requiring or justifying the setting of a threshold in nuisance cases, Kennaway v Thompson [1981] Q.B. 88 and Watson considered. By adopting such a threshold, the judge had deprived at least some of X of their right to have their individual cases assessed on their merits (paras 46, 121).</p></div></div> </div>

Any nuisance is &#8220;public&#8221; which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty&#8217;s subjects. 2. The sphere of the nuisance may be described generally as &#8220;the neighbourhood&#8221;; but the question whether the local community within that sphere comprises a sufficient number of persons to constitute a class of the public is a question of fact in every case. 3. It is not necessary to prove that every member of the class has been injuriously affected; it is sufficient to show that a representative crossection of the class has been so affected for an injunction to issue. 4. In general, a public nuisance is proved by the cumulative effect which it is shown to have had on the people living within its sphere of influence. In other words, a normal and legitimate way of proving a public nuisance is to prove a sufficiently large collection of private nuisances. 5. Prima facie, if a nuisance, whether public or private, is shown to have existed at the time the writ was issued the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction. If, however, between the writ and the trial the nuisance has been abated the court will usually stay its hand and merely give the plaintiff leave to apply in the action for an injunction if the trouble should recur.Per Denning L.J.: &#8220; . . . a public nuisance is a nuisance which is so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large.&#8221;The Attorney General in a relator action claimed an injunction perpetually restraining the defendant company from carrying on the business of quarrying in such a manner as to occasion a nuisance by dust or vibrations. The quarry adjoined a highway, and there were several houses abutting on the highway. Since 1949 there had been constant complaints by persons living near the quarry about the vibration and dust. There was a body of evidence as to personal discomfort. Oliver J. found that the various nuisances complained of still existed and granted the injunctions asked for.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; on appeal, any nuisance was &#8220;public&#8221; which materially affected the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty&#8217;s subjects and, on the evidence, a nuisance from vibration and dust was sufficiently widespread to amount to a common or public nuisance; therefore, the injunctions had been rightly granted and the appeal failed.

R had sent a large number of separate postal packages containing racist material to individual members of the public based on their perceived ethnicity. He had been charged on indictment of a single count of public nuisance, contrary to common law. G had posted an envelope containing salt to the address of a friend as a practical joke. The envelope did not reach G&#8217;s friend, as at a post sorting office some of the salt leaked onto a postal worker&#8217;s hands. The postal worker raised the alarm believing that the salt was anthrax. The sorting office was evacuated, the second delivery was cancelled and the police were called. R and G submitted that (1) the conduct formerly chargeable as the crime of public nuisance had now become the subject of express statutory provision, that the offence should be charged under the appropriate statutory provision, and that the crime of public nuisance had therefore ceased to have any practical application or legal existence; (2) the crime of causing a public nuisance, as currently interpreted and applied, lacked the certainty and predictability necessary to meet the requirements of the common law itself or the Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.7 .</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeals, that (1) the most typical and obvious causes of public nuisance were the subject of express statutory prohibition. Where Parliament had defined the ingredients of an offence, possible defences, a prescribed mode of trial and a maximum penalty it was ordinarily proper that conduct falling within that definition be prosecuted under the statutory offence and not a common law offence for which the potential penalty was unlimited. Good practice and respect for the primacy of a statute required that conduct falling within the terms of a specific statutory provision should be prosecuted under that provision unless there was good reason for doing otherwise. Although cases of common law public nuisance were relatively rare, it was not open to the court to conclude that the common law crime of causing a public nuisance no longer existed. (2) The guiding principles of common law, that no one should be punished under a law unless it was sufficiently clear and certain to enable him to know what conduct was forbidden before he did it, and that no one should be punished for any act that was not clearly and ascertainably punishable when the act was done, were entirely consistent with Art. 7, R. v Misra (Amit) [2004] EWCA Crim 2375, [2005] 1 Cr. App. R. 21 applied. The offence of public nuisance as defined in, R. v Stephens (1865-66) L.R. 1 Q.B. 702 was clear, precise, adequately defined and based on a discernible rational principle, Stephens , Attorney General v PYA Quarries Ltd (No.1) [1957] 2 Q.B. 169 , R. v Madden (Michael John) [1975] 1 W.L.R. 1379 and Sedleigh-Denfield v O&#8217;Callagan (Trustees for St Joseph&#8217;s Society for Foreign Missions) [1940] A.C. 880 considered. In the instant case, R had not caused a common injury to a section of the public, so his conduct lacked the essential ingredient of common nuisance. To permit a conviction of causing a public nuisance to rest on an injury caused to separate individuals, rather than on an injury suffered to the community or a significant section of it as a whole, was to contradict the rationale of the offence, pervert its nature, and change the constituent elements of the offence to the detriment of the accused, R. v Norbury [1978] Crim. L.R. 435 and R. v Johnson (Anthony Thomas) [1997] 1 W.L.R. 367 doubted. R&#8217;s conviction was quashed. A defendant was responsible for a nuisance which he knew, or ought to have known, would be the consequence of what he did or omitted to do, R. v Shorrock (Peter Coar) [1994] Q.B. 279 considered. In G&#8217;s case it had not been proven that G knew or should reasonably have known that the salt would escape into the sorting office or in the course of the post.

The issues to be decided were whether the local authority had brought onto its land something likely to cause danger or mischief if it escaped, and that was an ordinary user of its land.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that the test was whether the local authority had done something on its land which it (1) recognised, or ought reasonably to have recognised judged by the standards appropriate to the place and time, as giving rise to an exceptionally high risk of danger or mischief if there should be an escape, and (2) recognised, or ought to have recognised, as being quite out of the ordinary for the place and time. Piping of a water supply was a routine function which would not have struck anyone as raising any special hazard. The local authority had not accumulated any water but had merely arranged a supply adequate to meet the needs of the residents of the flats; the situation did not stand comparison with the substantial reservoir in Rylands v Fletcher . It was entirely normal and routine and could not be seen as in any way extraordinary or unusual, Rylands v Fletcher considered. The conditions to be met before strict liability could be imposed on the local authority were far from being met on the facts of this case.</div></div> </div>

However, cases of fire damage were likely to be very difficult to bring within the rule for several reasons, including the fact that it was the &#8220;thing&#8221; which had been brought onto the land which had to escape, not the fire.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>(1) The decision in Transco Plc v Stockport MBC [2003] UKHL 61, [2004] 2 A.C. 1 was the seminal authority for the test to be applied in Rylands v Fletcher . The proper approach was that the defendant had to be the owner or occupier of land; he had to bring, keep or collect an exceptionally dangerous or mischievous thing on his land; he had to have recognised, or ought reasonably to have recognised, that there was an exceptionally high risk of danger or mischief if that thing should escape; his use of the land had to be extraordinary and unusual; the thing had to escape from his property into or onto the property of another; the escape had to cause damage of a type relevant to the right and enjoyment of the claimant&#8217;s land. That re-statement of the rule had not left aside fire damage as some special category. It was not easy to rationalise the troubling decision in Musgrove v Pandelis [1919] 2 K.B. 43, but the court was bound to hold that the guidance in Transco applied in cases involving the escape of fire, Transco followed. However, cases of fire damage were likely to be very difficult to bring within the rule. First, it was the &#8220;thing&#8221; which had been brought onto the land which had to escape, not the fire which was started or increased by the &#8220;thing&#8221;. Second, whilst fire might be a dangerous thing, the occasions when it was brought onto land might be limited to cases where the fire had been deliberately or negligently started by the occupier. Third, starting a fire on one&#8217;s own land might well be an ordinary use of the land. Musgrove had to be treated as a fact-sensitive decision and would most definitely be decided differently in present times, Musgrove doubted (see paras 21-22, 46-49 of judgment). In the instant case, the &#8220;thing&#8221; brought onto S&#8217;s premises was a large stock of tyres, which were not exceptionally dangerous or mischievous. There was no evidence that W recognised or ought to have recognised that there was an exceptionally high risk of danger or mischief if they escaped. What had escaped was the fire, not the tyres. The recorder had been wrong to conclude that the escape of fire brought the case within Rylands v Fletcher principles. In any event, keeping tyres on the premises of a tyre-fitting business was not an extraordinary or unusual use of the land. Liability under Rylands v Fletcher had not been established (para.50). (2) (Per Lewison L.J.) The scope of strict liability in relation to fire should have been limited further. A fire which started accidentally had not been brought onto the land by the occupier &#8220;for his own purposes&#8221;. Under s.86 of the 1774 Act, a person was expressly exempted from liability for accidental fires. Parliament must have intended to change the common law proposition that a man &#8220;must use his own as not to injure another&#8221;. The decision in Mason v Levy Auto Parts of England Ltd [1967] 2 Q.B. 530, which followed Musgrove, was wrong and should have been overruled. An occupier of land should not be liable to his neighbour for a fire that began accidentally unless he was negligent in failing to prevent its spread, Transco, Musgrove, Mason and Goldman v Hargrave [1967] 1 A.C. 645 considered (paras 107, 109, 112, 126, 129, 164-166).</p></div></div> </div>

S made expanded polystyrene at its premises. The fire had broken out whilst an employee of S was cutting expanded polystyrene blocks with a hot wire machine. The fire had spread quickly and S&#8217;s premises had been largely destroyed. Fire and smoke had caused extensive damage to L&#8217;s premises and their contents. L claimed for damage to machinery, plant and stock and business interruption and C claimed for building reinstatement costs and loss of rent. The claim was based on strict liability for the escape of fire in accordance with the rule in Rylands v Fletcher , alternatively on negligence and nuisance. There was a secondary negligence/nuisance claim based on S&#8217;s alleged failure to take prompt action to put the fire out. The claims were also made against the individual defendants (D) as S&#8217;s landlords.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; giving judgment for L and C, that (1) the cause of the fire was probably associated with an arc or spark caused by the breaking of a wire that ignited the block being cut. The stages in the causation of the fire were not unusual and not in any way inexplicable. (2) In respect of Rylands v Fletcher liability S had brought on to their premises things which were likely to cause and/or catch fire. The flammable material was kept in such a way that if ignited the fire was likely to spread to L&#8217;s premises. The flammable material and the hot wire cutting machine represented a recognisable risk to L. S&#8217;s use of the land was a non-natural user, Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather Plc [1994] 2 A.C. 264 applied and Transco Plc v Stockport MBC [2003] UKHL 61, [2004] 2 A.C. 1 distinguished. (3) S was clearly liable in negligence and nuisance. They failed to take proper fire precautions. There were no interlocks on the cutting machine and the staff were not properly trained to deal with fires. The employee operating the hot wire cutter had not been trained and should not have been left unsupervised. S should have properly segregated the stored blocks of polystyrene or installed an automatic fire detection system. The decision not to install such a system was negligent and in breach of the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997 . (4) There was also negligence in failing to deal with or abate the fire immediately. (5) S was also liable to L in nuisance for failing to carry out proper works to the party wall after the fire. (6) D were not liable as landlords for the default of S, but they were liable to C under the terms of various deeds for failing to provide proper support to the party wall by carrying out appropriate remedial works after the fire.</div></div> </div>

A company&#8217;s decision not to disclose something as the result of an honest but mistaken belief that it did not need to be disclosed was therefore not enough to allow the insurers to avoid the policy.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Judgment for claimant.<p>(1) In light of the Oxford English dictionary definition of &#8220;deliberate&#8221;, the expression &#8220;deliberate or fraudulent non-disclosure&#8221; suggested a situation where the company intentionally failed to disclose something which it knew it should disclose. There was plenty of authority that the use of &#8220;deliberate&#8221; in the context of a &#8220;breach&#8221; or &#8220;default&#8221; meant an intentional act, and there was no logical distinction between a deliberate breach, on the one hand, and a deliberate non-disclosure on the other, De Beers UK Ltd (formerly Diamond Trading Co Ltd) v Atos Origin IT Services UK Ltd [2010] EWHC 3276 (TCC), [2011] B.L.R. 274 considered. In each case, the act or omission involved an element of culpability, of doing something which should not be done: it incorporated an element of dishonest wrongdoing. The word &#8220;deliberate&#8221; meant that the act of non-disclosure was intentional, that the insured acted in a way in which they knew they should not. Furthermore, the presumption against surplusage was not a &#8220;hard-edged&#8221; rule and the court should guard against giving it too much prominence in circumstances where some surplusage was often found in commercial contracts, Ener-G Holdings Plc v Hormell [2012] EWCA Civ 1059, [2013] 1 All E.R. (Comm) 1162 considered. In any event, the court was not persuaded that &#8220;deliberate&#8221; and &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; meant the same thing. Conduct could be deliberate and dishonest but not fraudulent. For example, a breach of contract could be deliberate and made in the knowledge that it was a breach, but might not be fraudulent. Similarly, a representation might be dishonest but, if there was no intention to deceive or no intention that the misrepresentation be acted upon, then it was not fraudulent. Guidance from the Financial Ombudsman Service also drew that distinction. A sensible and workable distinction between deliberate dishonesty and fraud was readily identifiable. On that basis, both words had utility, but both involved an element of dishonesty. Accordingly, &#8220;deliberate or fraudulent non-disclosure&#8221; in cl.6(a) meant a deliberate decision not to disclose something which the insured knew should be disclosed, and did not extend to an honest mistake (see paras 25-32, 35-36, 40-43, 45 of judgment).</p><p>(2) The proviso in cl.6(a) was a carve-out: an acknowledgement that, despite the wide range of remedies which the insurers accepted were not available to them, there was one type of situation which they were not prepared to forego. There was nothing in cl.5 or cl.6(a) which supported the insurers&#8217; case for a wide interpretation of the carve out (paras 46-52).</p><p>(3) A finding that the company would be penalised for dishonesty, but not for an honest mistake accorded with commercial common sense, HIH Casualty &amp; General Insurance Ltd v Chase Manhattan Bank [2003] UKHL 6, [2003] 1 All E.R.

It was well-established that rent paid in advance could not be apportioned on a time basis. It would be wrong to attribute an intention to the contrary save in a very clear case.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>(1) Implied terms generally - A clear statement of the tests of necessity for business efficacy and obviousness in relation to implying terms appeared in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings 180 C.L.R. 266, BP considered. The instant court made additional observations: (a) the implication of a term was not dependent on proof of an intention of the parties; the court was not concerned with the hypothetical answer of the actual parties, but with that of notional reasonable people in their position; (b) a term should not be implied into a detailed commercial contract merely because it appeared fair or because the parties would have agreed it if it had been suggested to them; (c) business necessity and obviousness could be alternatives, in the sense that only one of them needed to be satisfied; (d) if the officious bystander test was used, it was vital to formulate the question to be posed by him with the utmost care; (e) necessity for business efficacy required a value judgement. A simpler way of putting it was that a term could only be implied if, without the term, the contract would lack commercial or practical coherence, Philips Electronique Grand Public SA v British Sky Broadcasting Ltd [1995] E.M.L.R. 472 and Atkins International HA of Vaduz v Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (The APJ Priti) [1987] 2 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep. 37 applied. The decision in Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd [2009] UKPC 10, [2009] 1 W.L.R. 1988 suggested that the process of implying terms into a contract was part of the exercise of construing the contract. However, construing the words used in a contract and implying additional words were different processes governed by different rules. It was only after the process of construing the express words was complete that the issue of an implied term fell to be considered. The observations of Lord Hoffman at paras 17-27 of the Belize judgment should be treated as inspired discussion rather than authoritative guidance. Belize did not relax the traditional and highly restrictive approach to the implication of terms, Belize explained (see paras 18-22, 26, 31, 60, 66, 77 of judgment).</p><p>(2) Factors in favour of an implied term - Each quarter&#8217;s rent paid in advance was referable to the tenant&#8217;s use and enjoyment of the premises for that quarter. There was real force in the contention that if the landlord could retain the advance rent it would be unfairly prejudicial to the tenant. Further, the parties had agreed the terms of the break clause not knowing whether the break dates would be after, before or even on a quarter day. That supported the notion that they were unlikely to have intended the apportioned rent be retained by the landlord as part of the compensation for the operation of the break clause (paras 33-34).</p><p>(3) Factors against an implied term - The lease was a very detailed document, entered into between experienced parties and drafted by expert solicitors. The established legal background against which the lease was entered into was also relevant. Rent was not apportionable in time in common law. That position had been remedied to a certain extent by the Apportionment Act 1870 s.2 in relation to rent paid in arrears. However, s.2 did not apply to rent payable in advance, Ellis v Rowbotham [1900] 1 Q.B. 740 approved (paras 38, 42-44).</p><p>(4) Outcome - Save in a very clear case, it would be wrong to attribute to a landlord and tenant an intention that the tenant should receive an apportioned part of the rent paid in advance, when the non-apportionability of such rent had been so clearly established for so long. Express words would be needed before it would be right to imply a term to the contrary. The tenant&#8217;s appeal therefore failed in relation to the advance payments of rent, car parking and insurance (paras 50, 55).</p><p>(5) Service charge - The position in relation to the service charge was different as the lease enabled the service charge to be apportioned (para.55).</p><p>(6) (Per Lord Carnwath) The judgment in Belize had stimulated more than usual academic controversy, but that was not sufficient to question its continuing authority, Belize considered (para.74).</p></div></div> </div>

Two film reviews, written by the defendant and published in a Sunday newspaper, made deprecatory remarks about the physical appearance of B, an actor and director, who contended that these were intended to mean he was ugly in a way that exposed him to ridicule and that he was liable to be shunned as a result. The defendant argued that injury to feelings or annoyance caused by a statement was not relevant to the issue of defamation, which was defined solely by whether the words used were capable of causing injury to a person&#8217;s reputation.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that words could be defamatory even if they did not impute disgraceful behaviour or deficiencies in the conduct of business or professional activities. In B&#8217;s case, the test required was whether the words were defamatory when read in context by an ordinary reader. In libel, the words were not to be construed by reference to the publisher&#8217;s intention, although this could colour their meaning, but by the reader&#8217;s reaction to them. As a result, a jury might conclude that the context in which the remarks appeared might give an impression that B, a person in the public eye, was repulsive, and it was wrong to decide such a preliminary issue by withdrawing the matter completely from a jury&#8217;s consideration. Millett, L.J., dissenting, held that words used in jest should not be actionable. Even though the words used were meant to ridicule B, they did not make him look ridiculous or lower his reputation in the eyes of the public and in this sense they were not defamatory.</div></div> </div>

As long as the true position was made clear by the writer to the prospective reading public, the standards to which a writer wrote were simply a matter of choice of one product over another and therefore to impute to a writer that they wrote to one standard rather than another could not of itself be defamatory.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Application granted.<p>(1) Business defamation, as defined in Berkoff v Burchill [1996] 4 All E.R. 1008 and in Duncan &amp; Neil on Defamation, 3rd edn Ch 4, where it was dealt with almost as a separate tort, envisaged a claim for libel succeeding which might not involve any adverse reflection on the personal qualities of the claimant, Berkoff followed. Regardless of whether there was a separate tort of &#8220;business defamation&#8221; such cases did require separate consideration. Clearly a distinction had to be made between an imputation upon the goods or products of a professional or business person and an imputation upon the person himself, since the only cause of action available for the former would be malicious falsehood, South Hetton Coal Co Ltd v North Eastern News Association Ltd [1894] 1 Q.B. 133 considered. There was however, a danger of reading too much into Lord Esher&#8217;s example of the wine merchant in South Hetton , since no reference was made in that case to the fact that business men and professionals, including writers, could choose to deal in or produce different products directed to different markets. Some professionals had to work to a specific professional standard, but others, such as writers, were free to direct different products to different readerships or markets. As long as the true position was made clear by the writer to the prospective reading public, the standards to which a writer wrote were simply a matter of choice of one product over another. To impute to a writer that she wrote to one standard rather than another could not of itself be defamatory, Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association [1970] 1 W.L.R. 688 considered and Dee v Telegraph Media Group Ltd [2010] EWHC 924 (QB), [2010] E.M.L.R. 20 applied. In the instant case, the copy approval allegation was not capable of being a personal libel since it related only to T&#8217;s professional practices, nor was it capable of being professional libel, Derbyshire CC v Times Newspapers Ltd [1993] A.C. 534 applied. There was some similarity between the position of writers and the position of sportsmen in Dee, but it was not possible to translate the principles in cases such as South Hetton and Drummond-Jackson to the arena of professional writing. (2) Whatever definition of &#8220;defamatory&#8221; in Berkoff was adopted, and regardless of whether the defamation was business or professional or some other type of defamation, it had to include a qualification or threshold of seriousness so as to exclude trivial claims, Sim v Stretch [1936] 2 All E.R. 1237, Ecclestone v Telegraph Media Group Ltd [2009] EWHC 2779 (QB) and Jameel v Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc [2005] EWCA Civ 75, [2005] Q.B. 946 applied.

The natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of was that (a) M, whose chief executive was C, was one of the well-off landlords of rented properties on a particular street who let houses to people in receipt of housing benefit at rents of up to £650 per month, thereby making money from the misery of those residents; and that (b) C was personally responsible for that conduct of M, and had herself profited and become rich from it, in that she was paid £179,000 a year and lived in a large house in Gloucestershire. The apology was sufficient in the mind of the hypothetical reader to eradicate or at least minimise any unfavourable impression of M or C created by the original article in the mind of the hypothetical reasonable reader who read both. That left a residual class of readers of the original article who had not read the apology. As far as the latter group was concerned, it was important to note that the apology was now far more accessible on internet searches than the original article. Only someone actively trying to find the unamended article might come across it. The apology was not relevant to meaning, but was relevant to the issue of serious harm. The claimants accepted that there was no specific evidence that the article had caused serious harm to their reputation so far and such serious harm could not be inferred. They had also failed to show that it was more likely than not to cause serious harm to their reputations in the future (see paras 17,19, 21-22, 44-45 of judgment).</p></div></div> </div>

The claimant had a real prospect of demonstrating that the publication within England and Wales might be read by people whose opinion was of serious consequence to him and his business prospects, and that it had therefore caused serious harm to his reputation.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Application refused, cross-application granted.<p>(1) The Jameel jurisdiction was exceptional; the assessment of whether a real and substantial tort had been committed was not a &#8220;numbers game&#8221;. Even publication to a single individual could be highly damaging and make a substantial and costly libel action proportionate, Haji-Ioannou v Dixon [2009] EWHC 178 (QB) applied, Jameel followed. The Jameel principles were not solely applicable to libel claims but were of general application. The court had to have regard to its duty under the CPR to deal with cases justly and at proportionate cost. However, if a libel claimant had a real prospect of establishing a tort which was real and substantial, the court should be very reluctant to conclude that it could not be adjudicated in a proportionate way and that the only remaining way of dealing justly with the case was to dismiss it, Sullivan v Bristol Film Studios Ltd [2012] EWCA Civ 570, [2012] C.P. Rep. 34 followed (see paras 28, 33-34, 36 of judgment). (2) Although an individual suing for libel did not have to show an established reputation, whether a publication which created a bad reputation for someone who was previously unknown, or little known, amounted to a real and substantial tort would depend on circumstances such as the nature of the statement itself, the gravity of its meaning, and the nature and extent of its publication. Moreover, a publisher was responsible for damage caused by re-publications which were the natural and probably or reasonably foreseeable consequence of its own publication. It was a feature of the internet that material once published might remain accessible for a considerable time even if removed from the original site, as had happened in the instant case where the sting of the words complained of remained on third party sites for months afterwards. After January 1, 2014, the Defamation Act 2013 s.1 introduced the additional requirement that the harm suffered to the reputation of the claimant had to be &#8220;serious&#8221;. That had to be the starting point in relation to publications after that date, before the &#8220;real and substantial&#8221; test was applied. Thus, s.1 did not supersede Jameel (paras 40, 45-51). (3) C had a real prospect of showing that S had published the allegation complained of to all those who read the pages in question; of establishing that a meaning imputing involvement in illegal spamming was conveyed to those readers; and of demonstrating that the publication within England and Wales had caused serious harm to his reputation. It was common ground that S was considered authoritative and reliable; therefore, what it said about those on the ROKSO and Top 10 lists was very likely to be taken as true and relied on by readers. Nor was it possible to say that publication in England and Wales was inconsequential. C had past business connections in England which might be substantial and material; moreover, he had plans to launch a business with a UK presence. Although there had not yet been disclosure or a full examination of the evidence, C therefore had a real prospect of establishing that the words complained of might be read by people whose opinion was of serious consequence to him and his business prospects. That might be enough to establish serious harm to reputation. C had also demonstrated sufficient grounds to fear that, unless restrained, S would further publish words to the same effect as those complained of, since S evidently did not accept that what it published was wrong (paras 62, 92, 94, 97). (4) As it was not plain and obvious that C was unable to establish the existence of serious harm to his reputation in the US, he was granted permission to re-amend the particulars of claim to plead a claim in libel in respect of publication in the US (para.107).</p></div></div> </div>

Those authorities mostly involved &#8216;reference innuendos&#8217;, where statements were defamatory on their face but knowledge of extrinsic facts was required to link them to the claimant, rather than &#8220;meaning innuendos&#8221; such as in the instant case, where statements were only rendered defamatory by knowledge of extrinsic facts. However, the reasoning in those cases applied equally to both forms of innuendo, E Hulton &amp; Co v Jones [1910] A.C. 20, Cassidy v Daily Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1929] 2 K.B. 331, Hough v London Express Newspaper Ltd [1940] 2 K.B. 507 and Fullam v Newcastle Chronicle &amp; Journal Ltd [1977] 1 W.L.R. 651 applied. The European Convention on Human Rights 1950 art.10 did not compel a change in the law regarding innuendo: the availability of a Reynolds defence was, save perhaps in exceptional circumstances, sufficient acknowledgment by the courts of the need for protection of the press above the previous defence of fair comment, Joseph v Spiller [2010] UKSC 53, [2011] 1 A.C. 852 applied (see paras 21-28 of judgment). (2) There was no fault with the judge&#8217;s reasoning in respect of the second and fourth reader categories, but he had been wrong not to reach the same conclusion regarding the other categories. There were 400,000 Russians in the United Kingdom, some of whom might be in touch with events in Russia and some of whom might read the newspaper: one could not say the claim was bound to fail in that regard. Similar reasoning applied to online readers (paras 34-39). (3) Where meaning innuendo was alleged, the claimant ought to specify the persons with the knowledge from which they inferred the innuendo, Grappelli v Derek Block (Holdings) Ltd [1981] 1 W.L.R. 822 applied. In relation to the first category, although the newspaper had a wide circulation, there was no evidence of a wide circulation among Russians in England. The court would not find for B without specific readers who had appreciated the innuendo on reading the article being called, and it would be unfair on T not to require B to identify such readers. The same conclusion applied to readers in the other categories. Such readers would have to be produced at trial and be credible witnesses (paras 46-50).</p></div></div> </div>

By para.4 it was pleaded that the words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiffs had been guilty of, or were suspected by the police of being guilty of, fraud or dishonesty. Particulars pursuant to Rules of the Supreme Court Ord.19 r.6(2) , did not support the meaning pleaded in para.4 by extrinsic facts but were inferences from the words complained of. No plea of special damage was included. The defendants pleaded justification, in that it was true that on December 23, 1958, the police were inquiring into the affairs of the company.

At the trials before Salmon J. and juries evidence showed that the police were inquiring into the affairs of the company on the said date. Salmon J. directed the jury that the words could bear the meaning alleged in the innuendo, but did not point out the absence of any cogent evidence as to financial loss.

The former was regarded as a question of law, the latter as one of fact, with the result that the meaning eventually decided upon by the jury would be shielded from attack on appeal save where it had crossed the boundary of reasonableness. However, the decision that was traditionally reserved to the jury was a question of fact only because it was made by the jury, and it therefore followed that the court was entitled to retake the judge&#8217;s decision, Slim v Daily Telegraph [1968] 2 Q.B. 157 followed. (2) The words amounted to opinion. The issue posed by the judge was in reality two distinct issues: firstly, whether there was any evidence to support the material claims, and secondly, if there was not, whether the association&#8217;s personnel knew that. The judge had erred, both in conflating those two elements of the claim, and in treating the first of them as an issue of verifiable fact. The subject matter of the article was an area of epidemiology in which the relationship of primary fact to secondary fact, and of both to permissible inference, was heavily and legitimately contested. In his defence, S had set out, ailment by ailment and study by study, his reasons for considering that none of the available epidemiological evidence reliably supported the association&#8217;s claims, and the association had replied in kind asserting that there was some dependable evidence for its claims. It was one thing to defame somebody in terms that could only be defended by proving their truth, but it was another thing to evaluate published material as giving no evidential support to a claim and on the basis of that evaluation to denounce as irresponsible those who made the claim. It was clear therefore, that what &#8220;evidence&#8221; signified depended heavily on context, and whether such evidence amounted to proof was what scientific opinion was there to debate. If in the course of the debate the view was expressed that there was no evidence for one deduction or another, the natural meaning was that there was no worthwhile or reliable evidence for it. That was as much a value judgment as a contrary viewpoint would be. If the judge&#8217;s decision was to stand, it would not be open to the trial judge to conclude that what the evidence amounted to was a matter of opinion, as it would already have been decided that the existence or non-existence of evidence for the claims made by the association was a verifiable fact. It followed that the natural meaning of the words was not that the association was promoting what it knew to be bogus treatments, but that it was promoting what S contended were bogus treatments without regard to the want of reliable evidence of their efficacy.</p></div></div> </div>

However, the meaning of the words complained of was quite simple: &#8220;[W] has claimed nearly £70,000 from the taxpayer for a family home that is 60 miles from Eastbourne (fact). That is a scandal (comment)&#8220;. There was no statement, express or implied, to be identified in the publications to the effect that W had either broken the law or the parliamentary rules, or had been required to repay sums previously claimed. The reasonable reader would be well aware that there had been a significant criticism of the system of parliamentary expenses and that some MPs might have broken the law or the parliamentary rules, or might merely have made substantial claims strictly within the rules of the criticised system. However, all that had been stated was what W had claimed and the writers&#8217; view that that was &#8220;a scandal&#8221; or &#8220;scandalous&#8221;. The conduct upon which comment was advanced had been clearly identified, Joseph v Spiller [2010] UKSC 53, [2011] 1 A.C. 852 applied, Myerson v Smith&#8217;s Weekly Publishing Co Ltd considered. The judge had mischaracterised the matter: there was no allegation of scandal beyond the stated facts and the fact that there was thought to be a wider &#8220;scandal&#8221; did not alter that position. Those who thought that some claims to expenses, even within the law and the rules, were &#8220;scandalous&#8221; would not have strayed beyond comment if they identified the precise claims made and said that, in their view, they were scandalous.

Where adverse comment was made generally or generically on matters that were in the public domain, it was not a prerequisite of the defence of fair comment that the readers should be in a position to evaluate the comment for themselves, Kemsley followed, Cheng explained and Lowe v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2006] EWHC 320 (QB), [2007] Q.B. 580 considered. It was now possible for people to make public comment about others via the internet, and millions of people took advantage of that opportunity: it would often be impossible for readers to evaluate derogatory comments without detailed information about the facts that had given rise to the comments. If Lord Nicholls&#8217; fourth proposition were to apply, the defence of fair comment would be robbed of much of its efficacy. Lord Nicholls was not correct to require that the comment must identify the matters on which it was based with sufficient particularity to enable the reader to judge for himself whether it was well founded; however, the comment must identify at least in general terms what it was that led the commentator to make it. The fourth proposition should be rewritten as &#8220;Next the comment must explicitly or implicitly indicate, at least in general terms, the facts on which it was based&#8221; (see paras 90-105 of judgment). (2) The reforms suggested by E and the interveners would radically alter the nature of the defence of fair comment, and would not necessarily serve to simplify defamation actions. The proposed reforms went beyond changes that could properly be made by the Supreme Court in the orderly development of the common law. There was, however, a case for reform, and the whole area merited consideration by the Law Commission, or an expert committee. The only reform that should be made by the instant judgment was one that had already received judicial approval in the case of Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 A.C. 127: the defence of fair comment should be renamed &#8220;honest comment&#8221;, Reynolds referred to (paras 110-117). (3) E&#8217;s defence of fair comment should be reinstated. E could not rely upon the Landmarc breach to support the defence: the Landmarc breach was not referred to in the posting, nor did it form part of a generic allegation of misconduct. E could, however, rely on the Bibis breach: the posting sufficiently identified the breach as part of the subject matter of the comment, albeit that the breach was not particularised.</p></div></div> </div>

The intention of the original provision in the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1920 s.12(1)(g) had been that family members who enjoyed a committed relationship involving mutual love and support with the protected tenant should be protected. The question to be answered was whether in 1994, the date of T&#8217;s death, the homosexual partner of a protected tenant was intended to fall into that category of family members. In legal family relationships, the law made a presumption that the elements of mutual love, support and interdependency were present, but for any other person seeking to assert that they should be afforded protection as a family member, those elements would have to be established on the facts, R. v Ministry of Defence Ex p. Smith [1996] Q.B. 517 and Barclays Bank Plc v O&#8217;Brien [1994] 1 A.C. 180 considered. Despite the fact that this principle had not been accepted by the ECHR under the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 Art.8 and Art.12, the statutory provisions would be interpreted to include same sex partners in the definition of family members, since this was in accordance with social justice and recognised the fact that being part of a family represented a profoundly fundamental human relationship which brought with it obligations and benefits. However, for the familial relationship to be established, the relationship between the parties had to be of sufficient longevity and be more than a superficial relationship between friends living as cohabitees or short term sexual partners.</div></div> </div>

Confusion would be avoided if resort was had to the precise language of the statute. The weight to be given to each factor depended on the particular facts and circumstances of each case and, although there was no order of importance, each relevant factor had to be given its due weight. That approach ensured that flexibility was built into the exercise of discretion and as with every exercise of judicial discretion, the objective had to be to reach a just and fair result. Need, compensation and sharing would usually guide that search for fairness. As inherited wealth formed part of the property and financial resources of a party, it had to be taken into account pursuant to s.25(2)(a). The other relevant factors also had to be taken into account but the fact that wealth was inherited and not earned justified it being treated differently from wealth accruing from the joint efforts of the parties. It was not only the source of the wealth which was relevant but its nature. An ancestral castle might deserve different treatment from a farm inherited from a party&#8217;s father who had acquired it in his lifetime, just as a valuable heirloom was of a different character from an inherited portfolio of stocks and shares. The nature and source of an asset might well be a good reason for departing from equality within the sharing principle. The duration of the marriage and the length of time the wealth had been enjoyed by the parties was also relevant, as was their standard of living and the extent to which it had been afforded and enhanced by drawing down on the added wealth. The way the property was preserved, enhanced or depleted should also be taken into account. When property was acquired before or inherited during a marriage, it might be said that the spouse to whom it had been given should in fairness be allowed to keep it. On the other hand, the more and longer that wealth had been enjoyed, the less fair it was that it should be ring-fenced so as to render it unavailable to meet a party&#8217;s needs generated by the relationship. Judges should be cautious and not invade inherited property unnecessarily. No formula and no resort to percentages would provide the right answer. Weighing the various factors and striking the balance of fairness was an art, not a science (see para.43 of judgment). (2) There was a bracket within which the judge had to endeavour to find that sum of money which would enable W to enjoy a comfortable life while living independently from H. In endeavouring to be fair to both parties, the right sum to award was a total lump sum of £7 million. Looking at the case in the round, that would leave W well provided for and H could afford to make the payment from the proceeds of sale of the estate. The essential balance between needs and resources would be struck (paras 93-94). (3) The Court of Appeal should be very cautious in admitting fresh evidence of events which had occurred after an order had been made. The criteria established in Ladd v Marshall [1954] 1 W.L.R. 1489 of former unavailability, important significance and credibility were principally designed for evidence which related to past events. It did not follow that evidence of new events, which by definition was evidence which was not available at trial, should be admitted, Ladd v Marshall considered (para.96).</p></div></div> </div>

A claim for Reynolds privilege was often determined as a preliminary issue. However, that could raise a practical problem since in order to perform the balancing act between the desirability of the public receiving the information in question and the potential harm caused if the individual was defamed, it was necessary to determine the meaning of the publication. Meaning was normally a matter for the jury. However, the parties could agree to trial by judge alone. It would then be open to the trial judge to resolve any issues that arose in relation to the meaning of the words published. Further, a responsible journalist should have regard to the full range of meanings that a reasonable reader might attribute to the publication. The claim to Reynolds privilege would have to be assessed having regard to that range of meanings (see paras 2, 48-52 of judgment). (2) F had sought to rely on Purcell v Sowler (1877) 2 C.P.D. 215 and De Buse v McCarthy [1942] 1 K.B. 156, but Tugendhat J was correct to say that it was rather dangerous to rely on cases of such antiquity when dealing with fundamental issues of freedom of speech and respect for private life, Purcell and De Buse doubted. Each case would turn on its own facts and the overriding test was that of responsible journalism. In the instant case, subject to the issue of verification, it was in the public interest that both the accusation and most of the facts that supported it were published. The story, if true, was of high public interest. That interest lay not merely in the fact of police corruption but in the nature of that corruption, Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 A.C. 127 and Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe SPRL (No.3) [2006] UKHL 44, [2007] 1 A.C. 359 applied. It was generally likely to be in the public interest to publish the details of allegations of police corruption, whatever the nature of the alleged corruption, provided that the test of responsible journalism was met. The motivation of T&#8217;s journalist for publishing the accusation was also relevant. His doubts as to whether the police were exercising due diligence in investigating the allegation might constitute a legitimate aim of publishing, and it was in the public interest to ensure that the investigation was carried out promptly. Naming F had not conflicted with the test of responsible journalism or with the public interest. He would be identified by other members of his unit, and if he were not named, other members of the unit might have come under suspicion (paras 59, 68-74, 155, 169, 179-181, 195). (3) Reportage was a special form of Reynolds privilege which arose where it was not the content of a reported allegation that was of public interest, but the fact that the allegation had been made. The position was quite different where the public interest in the allegation lay in its content and in the fact that it might be true. The responsible journalist had to satisfy himself that the allegation was true; his belief in its truth had to be the result of a reasonable investigation and it had to be a reasonable belief to hold. Where a journalist alleged that there were grounds for suspecting that a person had been guilty of misconduct, he should satisfy himself that such grounds existed, but that did not necessarily require that he should know what those grounds were. Their existence could be based on information from reliable sources, or inferred from the fact of a police investigation. There was a strong circumstantial case against F. The supporting facts and the actions of the police had reasonably satisfied T that there was a serious possibility that F was guilty of corruption. The requirements of responsible journalism had therefore been met (paras 77-81, 99, 158, 167). (4) The second limb of T&#8217;s appeal, concerning continued publication after the outcome of the police investigation was known, was adjourned (para.107).</p></div></div> </div>

The provision imported the concept of recklessness enunciated in Horrocks v Lowe [1975] A.C. 175.</p><p>The claimant (M) sought permission to appeal against two decisions ([2002] EWHC 2564, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 927, [2003] C.L.Y. 961 and [2003] EWHC 1843) in his defamation action against the defendant newspaper (E). E had published an article written by a journalist (S) that contained words which the parties accepted conveyed the meaning that M was reasonably suspected of giving false evidence to an inquiry by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. E had made an unqualified offer to make amends under the Defamation Act 1996 s.2 and made proposals to implement the offer. M rejected the offer and gave reasons for doing so. Consequently, D pleaded the statutory defence under s.4 of the Act. In his reply M sought to rebut that defence alleging, in reliance on s.4(3) of the Act, that S had had &#8220;reason to believe that the statement complained of was false&#8221;. D applied to strike out the part of the reply which relied on s.4(3). In the first judgment the judge decided that a claimant was only able to challenge a s.4 defence where the defendant had chosen to ignore or shut his mind to information which should have led him to believe that the allegation was false. The judge held M&#8217;s reply was insufficient in law to rebut the s.4 defence and struck out the relevant paragraphs. M applied for permission to amend the reply. D opposed the application, contending that the proposed second version of the pleading still failed to measure up to the requirements of s.4(3). In the second judgment the judge upheld D&#8217;s contentions and refused M permission to amend his reply and ordered that judgment should be entered for D. M submitted that the judge misconstrued s.4(3) as importing a wholly subjective recklessness or &#8220;bad faith&#8221; test of the kind required for proof of malice in defamation proceedings.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; refusing the first application and allowing the second application in part, but dismissing the appeal, that (1) the judge&#8217;s interpretation of s.4(3) of the 1996 Act in his first judgment was entirely correct for the reasons which he gave. The words &#8220;reason to believe&#8221; in s.4(3) imported the concept of recklessness enunciated in Horrocks v Lowe [1975] A.C. 135. The reason for adopting this approach was that where a claimant established malice on the part of a person who published a defamatory statement, he would have the basis for a claim of aggravated, and possibly exemplary, damages. Malice apart, compensation could be fully assessed and awarded under s.3(5) of the Act. There would be little point therefore in relying on s.4(3) unless the requirement there was to establish malice. Recognising that some claimants might prefer a jury trial could not alone have been the parliamentary purpose. The phrase &#8220;had reason to believe&#8221; required an inquiry into what facts were in a person&#8217;s head and not into what facts ought to have been in his head. Reason to believe was not to be equated with reason to suspect or with constructive knowledge, Horrocks applied. (2) The judge was right to refuse permission to amend the reply. M&#8217;s attempt to elevate the proposed amended particulars to a case under s.4(3) fit to go to a jury failed for the reasons given by the judge. M&#8217;s central submission relied on far too brittle a chain of inferred or imputed reasoning on the part of S. What was required was not an inference but reckless indifference to the truth. The judge was right that there would be no proper basis for a jury to conclude from the amended particulars that S was recklessly indifferent to the truth of the relevant defamatory statement which he published.</div></div> </div>

Reporting restrictions orders in serious medical treatment cases could extend beyond the death of the subject of those proceedings. There was no presumption or default position that such orders should end when the subject died, Meek, Re [2014] EWCOP 1, [2014] C.O.P.L.R. 535 and Press Association v Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals Foundation Trust [2014] EWCOP 6, [2014] C.O.P.L.R. 502 applied (see paras 9.1, 9.11, 98-108, 144-145 of judgment).</p><p>(2) The duration of the order would be &#8220;until further order of the court&#8221;. There was no reason to order that reporting restrictions should terminate on the youngest daughter&#8217;s 18th birthday, as submitted by the respondent media organisations, as the two adult daughters also had valid art.8 rights which were engaged (paras 9.2, 9.14, 110-118, 142-143,167-169, 178-180).</p><p>(3) Balancing art.8 and art.10 was a case-sensitive exercise. Care should be taken in transporting comment on the weight of rival factors from one type of case to another, S (A Child) (Identification: Restrictions on Publication), Re [2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 A.C. 593 applied and C v Secretary of State for Justice [2016] UKSC 2, [2016] 1 W.L.R. 444 considered (paras 9.3, 43, 69-73).</p><p>(4) The first step was to consider whether there was a good reason for a public hearing. That was not an isolated or preliminary stage that, if such a good reason existed, would found an approach that the second stage was addressed on the premise the Court of Protection proceedings were treated in the same way as other proceedings where the default rule was that they were heard in public (para.9.4, 79-80, 90).</p><p>(5) The default rule that Court of Protection hearings were held in private represented a general conclusion on how best to administer justice. Neither art.8 nor art.10 took precedence so it would be wrong to approach the default rule as creating a presumption. Rather it was part of the structure for a reasoning process which applied the approach in S (A Child) to a given case (paras 9.5, 80, 91-92).</p><p>(6) In most cases, the important safeguards secured by a public hearing could be secured without identifying the people involved. Generally the court should ask (a) whether there were good reasons for a public hearing; (b) if so, whether there should be reporting restrictions; (c) how effective restrictions might be in promoting art 8 rights and how restrictive they would be of art.10 rights; (d) if the hearing was to be in public, what reporting restrictions should be imposed, and if the hearing was to be in private, what documents should be made public (paras 9.6, 9.7, 84-85, 96).</p><p>(7) Hearings would almost always be in public because of the benefits of open justice (paras 9.8, 97).</p><p>(8) Owing to the rival propositions relating to anonymisation, the court had to distinguish between cases falling within the default position of allowing media access, and cases where media access was restricted. The weight to be given to the general propositions regarding naming, and the court&#8217;s conclusion about what best promoted the administration of justice in any given case, would vary. They would often be taken into account in the context of (a) the validity of the reasons for the application, and (b) the impact of departing from the general conclusion on what generally promoted the administration of justice. Those reasons and that impact would need to be identified (paras 9.9, 9.10, 78, 95).</p><p>(9) In the instant case it should have been clear to anyone with compassion that the focus of the reporting would, and did, add greatly to the distress of the deceased&#8217;s daughters, one of whom was still at school. Much of the publicity had been precipitated by a wish not only to report the bases on which the court reached its decision, but to attract prurient interest in the deceased&#8217;s sexual and relationship history. It was obvious that naming or otherwise identifying the deceased would increase the family&#8217;s distress. Their art.8 rights were engaged, not least because the investigatory jurisdiction of the Court of Protection had invaded their private and family lives. (para.9.13, 29-35, 43, 74-77, 130-143).</p></div></div> </div>

Although juries should not be reminded of previous jury libel awards, reference to such awards was permissible in the absence of any established frame of reference, Rantzen v Mirror Group Newspapers (1986) Ltd [1994] Q.B. 670 and Broome v Cassell &amp; Co Ltd (No.1) [1972] A.C. 1027 considered. However, a change of practice should be introduced whereby counsel could draw a jury&#8217;s attention to the maximum conventional award for personal injuries and what would be reasonable in the circumstances, with the proviso that there could be no precise equiparation between an injury such as quadriplegia and injury to reputation. There was no reason why counsel could not make submissions or the judge indicate to the jury the level of award considered appropriate. With regard to assessment of exemplary damages, the jury had to be satisfied that the publisher had no genuine belief in the truth of the article published and that he was motivated by material gain, not merely the publication of a newspaper for profit. An award should never exceed the minimum necessary to satisfy the requirements of punishment and deterrence.</div></div> </div>
