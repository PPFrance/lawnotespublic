In other words, they are in agreement.<br>&emsp;&emsp;To identify the circumstances in which agreement is present, one begins by looking for an offer.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This lecture addresses the means by which the courts identify an offer as such.

Before this question can be addressed, there is a preliminary issue which must be explored. What perspective is adopted by the courts when they analyse the parties&#8217; dealings in order to identify offer and acceptance? Is the status of the parties&#8217; communications with each other analysed objectively, by reference to their ostensible meaning, or is it deduced from the parties&#8217; subjective intentions? The applicable rule is the first of those two approaches. The parties&#8217; “intentions” are objectively gauged.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">If that is so, and it is actually the <b>appearance</b> rather than the <b>fact</b> of agreement which is required, then the notion of being “of the same mind” is mildly problematic. The parties may be deemed to be in agreement even though actually they are not. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The following proposition goes some way towards resolving this tension. Being “ad idem” is a broad ideal in contract analysis; for example, it is perfectly proper to point out that the parties are not “ad idem” when there is open disagreement between them. However, ostensible agreement may prevail over actual but latent misunderstanding. The ideal of true agreement cannot generally be used to invalidate an ostensible agreement. The reason is that each party must be entitled to rely on what reasonably appears to be other&#8217;s intentions. Private, unexpressed intentions or reservations cannot undermine reasonable grounds for reliance. If it were otherwise, contract law would fail in its duty to promote certainty and predictability within the commercial sphere. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-11'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Offers - Offer Distinguished From Invitation to Treat</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Offer Distinguished From Invitation to Treat</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;What is the nature of an offer? To put it in preliminary and informal terms, we are looking for a proposal which indicates the maker&#8217;s willingness to be legally bound by acceptance, and one which is sufficiently clear and complete to be capable of acceptance.<br>&emsp;&emsp;An offer may be made in elaborately formal terms, or (at the opposite extreme) it may be brief, basic, and made without any preliminaries. However, very often the parties will move towards agreement, discussing the possibility of doing business together before any offer is made. These preliminary discussions are known as “invitations to treat”, and may well take the form of enquiries, obviously evincing no intention to be bound. Although it is essential to be able to distinguish between invitations to treat and offers, it is not always straightforward. A considerable body of case-law exists to chart the distinction.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Before we examine the cases on the distinction, there is an important preliminary point to be made. “Offer”, as a common English word, carries with it certain connotations. Be careful about carrying all those connotations over into the sphere of contractual analysis. For example, in the context of a sale of goods, one might naturally think that it is the seller of the goods who is offering them for sale. Legally speaking, the seller <i>may </i>be the offeror, but not necessarily so. A legal analysis may conclude that the buyer is the offeror. It is best to approach the cases with an open mind on this point; the offeror may be the active, initiating party within the negotiation, or not. Similarly, do not be dictated to by the parties&#8217; own use of the word “offer” (or “acceptance”). Legal analysis will take account of the parties&#8217; view of what they are doing, but will not be fettered by it. The applicable analysis is objective, nor subjective.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It is possible to lose sight of this basic principle where an offer is made in emphatically promissory language. Even if an offer is worded in such a way as to suggest that the offeror will act in accordance with it, come what may, the offeror is not legally obliged to do so unless and until the offer is accepted. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The reason for this ought to be briefly stated here; you will be looking at the underlying legal principle in greater detail soon. The offer does not bind its maker until acceptance has converted it into an agreement not only (a) because it might be said that the parties are not yet <i>ad idem</i> on the objective view which the law adopts, but also (b) because no <i>consideration</i> has yet moved from offeree to offeror. The law of consideration will be examined in detail later this term. For the timebeing, “consideration” can be understood as “something of value, moving from the offeree”.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

A simple but arbitrary rule is imposed; a posted letter of acceptance takes effect at the moment it is posted. On closer inspection, it will be seen that although there is an arbitrary aspect to this rule, in fact the usual legal values are present in an uneasy association with the rule itself. However, those values may sometimes be asserted to justify a departure from it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The usual authority given for the rule is <i>Adams v Lindsell</i> (1818) 1 B &amp; Ald 681, where the rule is applied in passing, really, but the court nevertheless takes the opportunity to buttress it on the grounds of finality. The justification is this; if the normal rule requiring actual communication were to apply to acceptance by post, so that the offeror became bound only when he knew of the offeree&#8217;s acceptance, then it could equally be maintained that the offeree should only be bound when he learnt that his acceptance had reached the offeror, and so on ad infinitum.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">However, this is hardly a convincing argument. There is a marked difference between the respective burdens of the two contingencies here being compared. It is one thing to be bound without yet knowing whether the offeree wishes to accept (he may or he may not). It would be a much lesser burden for the offeree to be bound without yet knowing whether his letter of acceptance has in fact arrived (it is highly likely that it will have done so). So even at its inception, the basis for the rule is shaky. Why, then, did it find its way into English law?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">A fascinating answer is given in Simon Gardner&#8217;s article “Trashing with Trollope: A Deconstruction of the Postal Rules in Contract” (1992) 12 OJLS 170. In 1840, the penny post was introduced. It caused a communications revolution as fundamental as the development of the mobile phone or email when people realised that the delivery of a letter had become a virtually certain consequence of posting it. Gardner continues: “This contemporary perception may have played a substantial part in the decision in which the courts established the acceptance rule in the 1840s. In these terms, the basis of the rule might have been not a preference for posting over delivery as the dispositive act. It might have been an idea that delivery was self-evidently important, but that in the newly prevailing conditions posting and delivery were little different: that once posted, a letter was as good as delivered. But there is a certain weakness about this. Despite the great improvements in efficiency…equating posting with delivery on purely empirical grounds would have been a little foolish: indeed, the reason why these cases came to court at all was because the equation had failed.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">However, some ... other innovations added a further dimension to this constructive identification of posting with delivery. One was a dramatic shift towards prepayment of postage. In March 1839, only 14% of letters sent by the London General Post were prepaid, leaving 86% for which payment had to be collected from the addressee. By February 1840 these figures had been precisely reversed. Prepayment was endorsed by none other than Queen Victoria herself, abandoning the privilege of free use of the mail. A year later still, the unpaid element had fallen further to 8%. A second was the further facilitation of prepayment by the introduction in 1840 of the self-adhesive postage stamp; another measure which entranced the public. Of the February 1841 prepaid total of 92%, 45% comprised letters for which the payment was by this means. A third important innovation was the cutting of letter-boxes in front doors of houses, so that letters no longer needed to be handed to their addressee; this too captured the public imagination.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Taken together, these measures may have great significance. Until 1840, the delivery of a letter typically required that the addressee should manually receive it and pay for it. This was not, of course, a significant practical hurdle, but it sat in symbolic contrast with the new position, whereby the sender had only to affix his stamp and post the letter, and it would go through to its destination without further subvention from outside the system. So these three innovations of 1840 may be seen as predicating a radically new perception of the nature of the post: the notional equation of the posting of a letter with its delivery. There may thus have been a very powerful influence towards the courts affirming the acceptance rule in the way that they did in that decade”.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Gardner expresses himself with due caution, but his thesis is attractive and persuasive. If he is right, then the reason for the postal rule lies not in one of the later theories given by way of apology for it (eg. the entirely flawed notion that the Postal Service is the agent of both the parties), but rather in the enthusiasm of the moment. This was an enthusiasm which proved capable of leading the courts away from their usual insistence on consensus ad idem. After all, if two cross-offers do not make a contract, even though each party to the negotiation must become aware that the other is in perfect agreement with him, how can offer and acceptance do so when only one party knows of the acceptance? </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">A more neutral explanation for the rule follows if one notes that in posting a letter of acceptance, the offeree (in the language of Lord Blackburn in Brogden&#8217;s case, above) has done “an extraneous act which clenches the matter”. He cannot get his letter back. The moment of posting is therefore the point in time at which he commits himself. The postal rule gives recognition to that fact, and is in accordance with English law&#8217;s usual tendency to make the concluding of contracts as simple as it can reasonably be.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">One nineteenth century judge, George <span class="bd">Bramwell</span>, fought a rearguard action against the postal rule. Probably he saw himself, and his predecessor the Lord Chief Justice Brian, as the few who had not lost their juristic wits. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-29'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Incomplete and Vague Agreements</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Introduction</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;As Viscount Dunedin said in <i>Hillas v Arcos</i> (see below), “to be a good contract there must be a concluded bargain, and a concluded contract is one which settles everything that is necessary to be settled between the parties and leaves nothing to be settled by agreement between the parties….As a matter of the general law of contract all the essentials have to be settled”. Viscount Maugham, in <i>Scammell v Ouston</i>, expresses a similar point from a slightly different perspective: “In order to constitute a valid contract, the parties must so express themselves that their meaning can be determined with a reasonable degree of certainty. It is plain that, unless this can be done, it would be impossible to hold that the contracting parties had the same intention”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The question therefore is whether an agreement is incomplete or too vague to be enforceable. Before we go further, it may help to define what is meant by “incomplete” and “vague” in the present context. Strictly speaking, an “incomplete” contract is one which leaves the parties not agreed on some matter, or in disagreement over it, or still aiming to reach agreement over it in the future. A “vague” contract is one which raises a question of what it is that the parties have agreed.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The barrier to enforcement of an incomplete agreement is that the courts do not exist to force agreement on the parties. This is a powerful principle; if the parties in truth are not bound to each other, it would be a wrong use of judicial power to treat them as if they were. The barrier to enforcement of a vague agreement is somewhat more easily overcome. The courts will not write a contract for the parties. Against this, however, must be set the principle that the courts should give effect to bargains, and there are several means of doing so even though some details of a bargain may not have been perfectly expressed.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As is often pointed out, incompleteness and vagueness may be difficult to distinguish on the facts of a case. It is not difficult to describe a lack of specificity as a failure to agree. The best approach may be to regard the two problems as technically distinct, while acknowledging that their tendency to coalesce is a major cause of the difficulties in some of the cases in this lecture.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The attempt to extract coherent principles from at least one group of cases has been described by Professor Iain Macneil as “a fool&#8217;s errand”. A perfect reconciliation of the authorities may well be impossible, but it is not the purpose of this lecture to try to undertake it. Instead, the starting point is to envisage an exemplary case in which a court must decide what to do about a gap within an agreement over which the parties are now arguing. Any reasonable person could come up with proposals for how to fill it, but the court is in a special position. It is not a maker of contracts; still less will it impose solutions which the parties, when contracting, have failed to agree. Nevertheless, there are juristic mechanisms for doing something very like that, for instance the implication of terms on the ground of necessity or “business efficacy”, solutions based on implications of reasonableness, and the power to hear evidence to resolve certain issues left outstanding between the parties. The means to fill the gap between the parties may well exist.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The issue in a case such as this is how far the court can properly go, and careful navigation is called for. The present area of contract law can&#8217;t be made plain sailing, because by definition it is not, but it is possible to chart some judicial assumptions, principles and instincts which will help to suggest the way a court may lean.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Accounts of the subject often begin by contrasting two early twentieth century House of Lords cases – <i>May &amp; Butcher v The King</i> (1929) and <i>Hillas v Arcos</i> (1932) – with a view to preferring the latter. To begin the discussion with what is effectively a stalemate on the authorities does not seem a very helpful way forward, since it tends to leave students either confused, or inclined to treat the relationship between the two cases as a brain-teaser. Here, those cases will be left to the very end of the lecture, in the hope that the comparison between them will be easier to understand with some knowledge of how the law in this area works.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The present concern is a “conditional agreement” of a different type, where the operation of the entire agreement (on the true construction of the arrangement between the parties) is expressed to depend on the fulfilment of a condition.

You will immediately see from this use of the word “consideration” that it does not have its ordinary English meaning here. In this context it is a legal term of art. A working definition of consideration (but no more than a working definition) would be “the price of the promise” - what the promisor requests in return for the promise made.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Practitioners sometimes observe that cases on consideration are infrequent, and wonder why it is given such emphasis in academic courses on contract law. Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> is on record as saying that he could not recall a case on consideration ever coming before him (though several in fact did). It is true to say that in the majority of dealings, consideration will be clear. After all, it is unusual for contractual performance, or the promise of it, to be offered gratuitously. Furthermore, the view of the law is that a promise made in response to a promise (ie. by way of acceptance) will itself constitute consideration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Problem cases do arise, but beyond that, the doctrine of consideration is a subtle and interesting one which richly deserves academic attention. The fact is that consideration has almost certainly meant different things at different times. This lecture will not attempt to give a systematic historical account of consideration&#8217;s development in the law, but it does assume from the outset that most definitions of consideration give only a partial view of what the doctrine is, and what it means.<br>&emsp;&emsp;At several points during the lecture, and with increasing frequency, there will be hints that a case is not quite as it seems, and reference to the topic which will be tackled at the end – Professor Atiyah&#8217;s understanding of consideration. If, as you encounter these indications, you find them mystifying or irritating, you can go straight to the end to resolve the problem. However, there would be far more to be gained from the lecture by working through the cases, giving some preliminary thought to what kind of a doctrine consideration is, and focusing on the indications that another understanding of it is available just beneath the surface.<br>&emsp;&emsp;With that in mind, it is time to examine the traditional definitions. They give necessary insights into the working of consideration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A well-known one comes from the nineteenth century case of <i>Currie v Misa</i> (1875). There, Lush J said that “A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility, given, suffered, or undertaken by the other”. To make sense of this, add into it the notion that it is the promisor who needs to be gaining the benefit, or the promisee who needs to be sustaining the detriment.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If it should be asked <i>why</i> there should be benefit to the promisor or, still more pertinently, detriment to the promisee, the working answer lies in the concept of bargain. One view of consideration, highly influential in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, coupled it with the principle that the courts would not enforce gratuitous promises or gifts, but only bargains, accords, exchanges. The character of these enforceable arrangements was that each party could be seen to gain something, but also to give something up in order to realise the gain. Hence, benefit to the party who is to give, or detriment to the party who is to receive.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A cogent exposition of the relationship between consideration and bargain, viewing it as a necessary relationship, is given by C.J.Hamson, writing in 1938:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“What is today the significance of consideration in the law of simple contract? So far from being an additional and unnecessary mystery, an accidental tom-tit in an otherwise rational theory of contract, consideration in its essential nature is an aspect merely of the fundamental notion of bargain, other aspects of which, no less but no more important, are offer and acceptance. Consideration, offer and acceptance are an indivisible trinity, facets of one identical notion which is that of bargain. Indeed, consideration may conveniently be explained as merely the acceptance viewed from the offeror&#8217;s side. Acceptance is defined to be the doing of that act (which may be the giving of a promise or the rendering of a performance) which is <i>requested</i> by the offeror in return for his promise; it is the <i>response</i> to the offer. An act done at the request of the offeror in response to his promise is consideration; and consideration in its essence is nothing else but response to such a request. To a gratuitous promise the common law notion of offer and acceptance does not apply. We can no doubt separate offer, acceptance and consideration for our convenience in treating of them: but they are logical and interdependent entities abstracted from the one entire reality which is bargain. We can no more abolish one without destroying the others than we can think of a circle without a circumference...”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;For the time being there is no reason to take issue with this account; it works well enough to explain the majority of the cases. Just to sow a seed of doubt, or record a reservation which will be expanded later, it is worth remarking that Hamson&#8217;s indivisible trinity of offer, acceptance and consideration tells one nothing about why the word “consideration” is an appropriate one in this context.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

What is “value in the eye of the law”? Presumably something other than mere “value”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">Treitel</span> considers that economic value is meant. Paragraph 3-027 of <i>The Law of Contract</i>, below the heading “Must be of economic value” proposes that “An act, forbearance or promise will amount to consideration only if the law recognises that it has some economic value. It may have such value even though the value cannot be precisely quantified. But “natural affection of itself is not a sufficient consideration”, and the same is true of other merely sentimental motives for promising. This is the reason why in <i>Thomas v Thomas</i> the desire of the testator that his widow should live in his house was not part of the consideration for the executors&#8217; promise that she might do so”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Is economic value required, as Treitel suggests? He cites no authority to establish that, and it does not follow from the ratio decidendi of <i>Thomas v Thomas</i>.

The fiction consists in finding an earlier request for performance, into which a promise to pay for the performance is implied. The second promise (the real one) is then treated as fixing the amount which it to be payable pursuant to the original, implied promise. “Assumpsit”, meaning “he undertook”, is the old legal term for a legally binding promise.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

If that happened, the mine would flood. The manager asked the local police superintendent to install a force of 100 men at the colliery in case of trouble. The superintendent considered that billeting a force on site was not necessary, but nevertheless agreed to provide 70 men in return for payment as well as food and accommodation. The force was provided, but the colliery refused to pay. The police authority sued for the promised payment. The colliery argued that no consideration had been received for the promise to pay since the police were doing no more than their legal duty to keep the peace. There was also a counterclaim for the cost of feeding and accommodating the 70 men. It was decided at first instance, then in the Court of Appeal and finally in the House of Lords, that the action on behalf of the police succeeded, and the counterclaim failed. However, both appellate decisions were those of bare majorities.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The case which needed to be made on behalf of the police here was a tricky one. If, on the one hand, they were doing what was reasonably necessary to keep the peace, they would lose; this was no more than their legal duty. If on the other hand they were doing more than was necessary to keep the peace, they would need to explain why. In the Court of Appeal, <span class="bd">Atkin LJ</span> (dissenting) saw this in stark terms, suggesting that if more was being done than necessary, the contract would be contrary to public policy, illegal and void. In the House of Lords the majority considered that between the extremes of necessary and unnecessary involvement lay a middle ground in which the police could properly exercise the discretion to provide special services. This is what had been done on the facts of the case, and since it went beyond the mere duty of keeping the peace, it was regarded as consideration.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">You may wonder if the question whether the police should be able to charge for their services is most conveniently debated in terms of consideration. It is a broad and crucial issue of public policy. The Smith &amp; Thomas Casebook on Contract puts this issue pointedly, in the form of a question inspired by the facts of a similar case, Harris v Sheffield Football Club (1987): “1. The Rovers&#8217; F.C. secretary telephones the Chief Constable – “The crowd is fighting – police are overwhelmed – send help”. The Chief Constable replies, “Only if you agree to pay”. The secretary agrees. Does the Club have to pay the bill? If not, why not? – is it a question of consideration?”</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Smith &amp; Thomas, with their usual skill, are prompting their readers to realise that there are a good many factors in addition to consideration which may condition the validity of a contract; here duress, public policy, illegality and bad faith spring to mind. If one asks why the performance of an existing legal duty does not amount to sufficient consideration, it will be all but impossible to avoid giving an answer in terms of factors which seem at first to lie beyond the principles of consideration. It all depends, of course, on how widely one draws the boundaries of consideration; perhaps it is not a tight package of rules about bargain, but a broader space in which all manner of factors may interact. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> cut through these difficulties by taking the simple view that performance of a general legal duty could amount to consideration, as the next case shows.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The mother later wrote, proposing that she should look after her daughter for the same weekly allowance. The father said that he agreed “providing you can prove that she will be well looked after and happy and also that she is allowed to decide for herself whether or not she wishes to come and live with you”. The father stopped the payments when the mother married. She brought an action against him, and he took the point that since the child was illegitimate, the then law (s. 42 of the National Assistance Act 1948) cast the burden of providing for her upon the mother as an existing duty. The Court of Appeal upheld the mother&#8217;s claim.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">Denning LJ</span> gave this explanation of his view of the relevant law: “I approach the case, therefore, on the footing that, in looking after the child, the mother is only doing what she is legally bound to do. Even so, I think there was sufficient consideration to support the promise. I have always thought that a promise to perform an existing duty, or the performance of it, should be regarded as good consideration, because it is a benefit to the person to whom it is given. Take this very case. It is as much a benefit for the father to have the child looked after by the mother as by a neighbour. If he gets the benefit for which he stipulated, he ought to honour his promise, and he ought not to avoid it by saying that the mother was herself under a duty to maintain the child”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Morris LJ preferred a more conventional way of deciding in favour of the mother: “It seems to me, therefore, that the father was saying, in effect: Irrespective of what may be the strict legal position, what I am asking is that you shall prove that the child will be well looked after and happy, and also that you must agree that the child is to be allowed to decide for herself whether or not she wishes to come and live with you. If those conditions were fulfilled, the father was agreeable to pay. On those terms, which in fact became operative, the father agreed to pay £1 a week. In my judgment, there was ample consideration there to be bound for his promise, which I think was binding”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Denning LJ&#8217;s approach to the law in this case is cavalier, as it often was, but quite hard to dispute. Why should the fact of the existing legal duty not simply drop away as a wholly unnecessary impediment to finding consideration, given that the father requested a benefit of the mother and received it? </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The difficulty with this approach is that it includes a disconcerting echo of an eighteenth century notion which was only briefly accepted as good law. Lord Mansfield, Chief Justice of the King&#8217;s Bench in the latter part of that century, made several attempts to establish his view that a promise should bind simply as a matter of “honesty and rectitude”. In the long run he was not successful. Denning LJ goes nearly that far, because he is saying that it does not matter from what quarter the father receives the benefit of having his child looked after. The real point is that a promise should be honoured and not avoided on a technicality. This comes close to dispensing with the requirement of consideration altogether.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Lord Mansfield himself had tried to outflank that objection by arguing (in Hawkes v Saunders (1782)) not that honesty and rectitude made consideration unnecessary, but that they were capable of being consideration: “The ties of conscience upon an upright mind are a sufficient consideration”. This is not the law; but if such factors as bad faith, duress and intention to create legal relations can operate alongside consideration – and maybe even coalesce with it – why should rectitude not also have a part to play?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">(b) Performance of contractual duties already owed to a third party as consideration</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The promise had been made “in consideration that the plaintiffs, at the request of the defendant, would deliver to the defendant” the coal. The defendant argued that the delivery of the coal was in fact no consideration, since the plaintiffs were already bound to a third party to deliver the coal either to them, or to their order. The third party had sold the coal to the defendant. The plaintiffs succeeded. The court&#8217;s reasoning with regard to consideration is not altogether easy to follow, but it seems that it was simply regarded as beneficial to the defendant to receive the coal. Furthermore, it is posited that the plaintiffs might have wished to breach their contract with the third party, and had therefore sustained the detriment of a further liability to the defendant if they were to do so.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This reasoning seems inadequate and somewhat strained. If the defendant was to receive the coal anyway, it was no added benefit to him to receive it pursuant to a direct contractual nexus with the plaintiffs. The point is similar to the one raised by <i>Ward v Byham</i> above, and again tends towards the conclusion that the defendant should simply do what he promised. As for the detriment sustained by the plaintiffs through the limitation of their freedom to breach a contract, this is not quite as unacceptable as the judgment of Erle CJ in <i>Shadwell v Shadwell</i> cited above, but it is contrived almost to the point of breakdown.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the next case, the House of Lords approves <i>Scotson v Pegg</i> as good law.

It expressly extended this protection to the carrier&#8217;s servants or agents. The carrier engaged stevedores to unload the cargo (a drilling machine), which was damaged in the process. The stevedores claimed the benefit of the exclusion clause in the bill of lading. One of the questions arising was whether the stevedores had provided any consideration which would make the “promise” in the bill of lading binding. They had unloaded the goods, but they were already contracted to the carrier to do so. The Privy Council held, by a bare majority, that the stevedores were protected by the exclusion clause.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Wilberforce made the following comment on the search for consideration in this case: “If the choice, and the antithesis, is between a gratuitous promise and a promise for consideration, as it must be, in the absence of a tertium quid, there can be little doubt which, in commercial reality, this is. The whole contract is of a commercial character, involving service on one side, rates of payment on the other, and qualifying stipulations as to both. The relations of all parties to each other are commercial relations entered into for business reasons of ultimate profit. To describe one set of promises, in this context, as gratuitous, or <i>nudum pactum</i>, seems paradoxical and is prima facie implausible. It is only the precise analysis of this complex of relations into the classical offer and acceptance, with identifiable consideration, that seems to present difficulty, but this same difficulty exists in many situations of daily life, for example, sales at auction; supermarket purchases; boarding an omnibus; purchasing a train ticket; tenders for the supply of goods; offers of reward; acceptance by post; warranties of authority by agents; manufacturers&#8217; guarantees; gratuitous bailments; bankers&#8217; commercial credits. These are all examples which show that English law, having committed itself to a rather technical and schematic doctrine of contract, in application takes a practical approach, often at the cost of forcing the facts to fit uneasily into the marked slots of offer, acceptance and consideration”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;By now it should be possible to see what is going on here. This is a complex commercial situation, in which to ask whether the parties have struck a bargain or alternatively are making gifts of their services to each other is daft. Their business is the making of bargains. If consideration in a narrow sense cannot be found, then it will be found in a broad sense. The law, as far as Lord Wilberforce is concerned, cannot refuse to handle a commercial relationship of this type because of a lack of consideration. Therefore, there is consideration.

Rather than repaying the debt, William gave his father a promissory note for the sum owing. After John&#8217;s death, his executor brought an action against William on the promissory note, and in debt. William&#8217;s defence to this action was to plead a contract with his father to the effect that repayment would not be required, and that there would be no liability on the note. This contract was said to have arisen through William making complaints to his father that he had not been treated as favourably as his father&#8217;s other children; his father admitting that this was so; and the two then agreeing that in consideration of William ceasing to bore his father with complaints, repayment of the loan would not be required. The court held that William was liable. There was no contract, since there was no consideration. Consideration could not be found in promising to do what one had no right to do in the first place.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Had it been so minded, the court could easily have taken a different view. The judgment appears to rest on the footing that William had no right to complain. Whether or not he had a good reason to complain is immaterial; in terms of legal rights, he was free to complain if he wished, because there was no law to make his complaining illegal. If he chose to limit his freedom in return for a promise when he was not otherwise bound to do so, he gave consideration. Why, then, was the court not prepared to adopt this view?<br>&emsp;&emsp;The answer leads beneath the surface of the doctrine of consideration, following in a direction already suggested in commentary on previous cases. The court in <i>White v Bluett</i> did not want William&#8217;s defence to succeed. Quite possibly they thought it a pack of lies devised to get out of a paying a debt (though it is sufficiently abject to have a slight ring of the truth). The notion of consideration is pressed into service in order to cut the legal ground from under the defence, but what is really being said is that there is <i>no good reason</i> for giving legal effect to the promise pleaded by William.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A modern court might reach the same result by finding no intention to create legal relations, or by invoking the doctrine of undue influence, or by coming straight out with it and holding that William&#8217;s evidence is not credible. Does the court of 1853 distort the doctrine of consideration by pressing it into use on these facts? In a sense of course it does. But the better answer may be that it does not, provided one accepts that “consideration” actually means the presence of a sufficient reason to enforce a promise. Here there is no such reason; ergo, there is no consideration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is one thing to find a mid-nineteenth century court using the doctrine of consideration to gloss over the use of what is effectively a discretion to take a case seriously or not. It is more striking when arguably the same thing is done by the House of Lords at the end of the twentieth century:</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-65'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Consideration - “Problem” Cases</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd</span></span></p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;A dishonest solicitor stole some £200,000 from his firm&#8217;s client account, and used it to gamble at the Playboy Club. The system in operation at the club was that a client would pay over money in advance of gambling, and receive in return plastic gambling chips, which could also be used to purchase refreshments. The firm of solicitors sought to recover the money from the club through the restitutionary action of unjust enrichment. The club&#8217;s defence was that it had not been unjustly enriched, since it had given consideration in return for the money. The Court of Appeal held by a majority that this defence succeeded, so that the money was not recoverable. The House of Lords unanimously allowed the firm&#8217;s appeal. The obtaining of the chips, and gambling with them, was a single transaction which was void by reason of s.18 of the Gaming Act 1845. Furthermore, the chips could not be regarded as consideration for the money handed over by the solicitor.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;After <i>Chappell v Nestle</i>, in which worthless chocolate wrappers were held to be consideration for recordings, it may initially be hard to accept that plastic chips cannot be consideration when given in exchange for money, and the principle that consideration need not be adequate technically blocks the objection that the sum paid for the chips was astronomical. However, the reality of the transaction at the Playboy Club was not that the client was buying chips. He was buying the opportunity to gamble, which to him was substantial; otherwise he would not have paid such very large sums of money to secure it. This was the argument which impressed Parker LJ, who was in the majority in the Court of Appeal. It was set out by Lord Goff in the House of Lords in the course of his rejection of it:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“I have to say at once that I am unable to accept the alternative basis upon which Parker LJ held that consideration was given for the money, viz. that each time Cass [the solicitor] placed a bet at the casino, he obtained in exchange the chance of winning and thus of being paid. In my opinion, when Cass placed a bet, he received nothing in return which constituted valuable consideration. The contract of gaming was void; in other words, it was binding in honour only. Cass knew, of course, that, if he won his bet, the club would pay him his winnings. But he had no legal right to claim them. He simply had a confident expectation that, in fact, the club would pay; indeed, if the club did not fulfil its obligations binding in honour upon it, it would very soon go out of business. But it does not follow that, when Cass placed the bet, he received anything that the law recognises as valuable consideration. In my<br</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Why is it not valuable consideration in the eye of the law to gain the opportunity to gamble, and the chance of winning very large sums of money as a result? It is true that, at the time of this case, gambling contracts were void pursuant to legislation, but the gambling was not illegal. Had this been a commercial case, in which one party was prepared to expend a great deal of money to enter into a very highly speculative transaction, would the court have held that he received no consideration for his outlay?<br>&emsp;&emsp;A court which found consideration moving from the Playboy Club here would have prevented the operation of restitution to restore the stolen money to the firm which had lost it. It is not far-fetched to suggest that the House of Lords found sufficient flexibility in the doctrine of consideration to avoid this inconvenient outcome. Maybe it is very proper that consideration retains the flexibility which can enable it to be used to lever a case towards a just conclusion.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-66'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Consideration - Atiyah's Understanding of Consideration</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Atiyah&#8217;s Understanding of Consideration</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;It is time now to examine what “consideration” actually means in the light of the authorities discussed above. As pointed out earlier, it is a legal term of art, but its legal meaning is not remote from one of its meanings in ordinary English. “Consideration” means, simply, a reason – the court&#8217;s reason for enforcing a promise. The rules of sufficiency of consideration are accretions around what, at base, is a judicial discretion, and sometimes the discretionary element shows through.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This was argued at length by Professor Atiyah in a seminal essay (“Consideration: A Restatement” in <i>Essays in Contract</i> (1986)) which deserves to be quoted at length:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“It is my purpose to suggest that the conventional account of the law is unsatisfactory.... The truth is that the courts have never set out to create a doctrine of consideration. They have been concerned with the much more practical problem of deciding in the course of litigation whether a particular promise in a particular case should be enforced. Since it is unthinkable that any legal system could enforce <i>all</i> promises it has always been necessary for the courts to decide which promises they would enforce. When the courts found a sufficient reason for enforcing a promise they enforced it; and when they found that for one reason or another it was undesirable to enforce a promise, they did not enforce it. It seems highly probable that when the courts first used the word “consideration” they meant no more than that there was good “reason” for the enforcement of a promise. If the consideration was “good”, this meant that the court found sufficient reason for enforcing the promise. All this is not to suggest that the law was ever unprincipled, or that judges ever decided cases according to personal or idiosyncratic views of what promises it was desirable to enforce. As always with the common law, it was the collective view of the judges, based largely on the conditions and moral values of the community, which prevailed over a period of time....<br>&emsp;&emsp;At a relatively early date it was established that the courts would enforce a promise if another promise or an act was given in return for it; and also that they would not normally enforce a promise if it was merely intended as a gift with no return of any kind. In the first class of case it came therefore to be said that there was good consideration; there were good reasons for enforcing the promise. In the second class there was no such reason, and therefore no consideration. But it also became clear from a very early time that the whole law could not be reduced to such very simple terms. There were some cases in which a promise was given in return for another promise or act, in which for one reason or another it was felt unjust or inexpedient that the promise should be enforced. Such cases could be, and sometimes were explained by saying that there was no consideration for the promise; but as the nineteenth century wore on, an alternative approach began to manifest itself. This was to say that there was good consideration (though perhaps the word “good” would more usually be omitted) but that nevertheless the promise was unenforceable for other reasons, for example, because it had been extorted by duress, or fraud, or because it was illegal. The last type of case was often dealt with by saying that the consideration was unlawful; a judge who formulated his reasons in this way would perhaps, if pressed, have said that there was no “good” consideration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;More recently still, this alternative approach has hardened so that courts now find nothing inconsistent in holding that there is consideration for a promise, but nevertheless refusing to enforce it because the transaction is illegal. This approach also manifests itself in the relatively modern device of refusing to enforce a promise on the ground that the promisor did not “intend” to create legal relations by his promise. Where this is done (as it usually is) in a case where there is no express disavowal of the intent to create legal relations, it appears to be merely a legal justification for refusing to enforce a promise which the courts think, for one reason or another, it is unjust or impolitic to enforce. There seems to be no doubt that a hundred years ago the courts would have dealt with these problems in terms of consideration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This change of approach is symptomatic of the change which has developed in the way lawyers think about consideration. It is no longer thought that consideration is a compendious word simply indicating whether there are good reasons for enforcing a promise; it is widely assumed that consideration is a technical requirement of the law which has little or nothing to do with the justice or desirability of enforcing a promise. Modern lawyers thus see nothing incongruous in asserting that a promise made for good consideration should nevertheless not be enforced.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As we shall see below, the restatement of the law which the actual decisions compel us to adopt, differs from the conventional view principally in recognising the importance of the untypical and marginal cases. It is not, however, merely a question of recognising that there are exceptions to the ordinary rules to which adequate attention has not always been paid. If that were all, there would be little need, or justification, for a fundamental restatement of the law. A restatement will require rather more than that; it will require in particular that lawyers start to think of consideration once again in terms of reasons for enforcing promises; it will require lawyers to recognise that the presence of factors like benefit, detriment, and bargain is taken into account not because they fit some preconceived plan or definition, but because they are often very material factors in determining whether it is just or desirable to enforce a promise; and this necessarily involves recognition that these are not the only factors to which attention must be, and is in practice paid by the Courts”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It begins by examining the third of three pre-existing duty situations – the problem of regarding as consideration the performance of an existing contractual duty owed directly to the promisor (the first two duty situations were covered in the last lecture). The second part of the lecture is an exploration of equity&#8217;s solution to this difficulty – the doctrine of promissory estoppel which accords limited effect to promises which are not supported by consideration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Parts of the lecture, unavoidably, are complex. There are various reasons for this, and they deserve to be recognised from the outset. The first is that the law in this area has developed in an extremely narrow space, confined by the decisions in <i>Stilk v Myrick</i> and <i>Foakes v Beer</i> (approving the rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i>). The mapping of this space and the decisions reached within it requires care. The second reason for complexity is that a large part of the modern law in this area arises from the relationship between common law and equity. Thirdly, a fault line runs through the whole area of part payment of debt; principles derived from debt and from assumpsit (contract) as a means of relinquishing a debt strain against each other.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Discussion of this lecture&#8217;s topics is therefore quite demanding, but application of the principles to the facts of problem questions need not be. A fairly basic grasp of what the main authorities decide will tend to lead to plausible answers.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-72'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Towards Promissory Estoppel - Existing Contractual Obligations to Promisor as Consideration - Part Payment of a Debt as Consideration</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Part Payment of a Debt as Consideration</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The cases examined so far, as remarked above, concern original promises to perform services pursuant to contract, in return for which further payment is later promised. The focus now shifts to the situation in which the original undertaking is to pay a sum of money, in other words a debt. This is not merely a repeat of the previous type of arrangement this time with different facts. In the debt cases, the debtor is not fulfilling the original obligation in return for the creditor promising something extra – these are simply not the facts. Instead, the debtor is proposing to make part payment of what is owed in return for the creditor receiving such performance in full satisfaction of the whole debt. The difference is sometimes described as being between an increasing pact (the service cases) and a decreasing pact (the debt cases). Nevertheless, the nub of the problem, as before, consists in whether a new agreement can be considered contractually binding even though it is not supported by consideration in the conventional sense. It might be thought that there would be much to be said for a single solution to both types of case. After all, they do not appear logically to be that different.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The mechanics of the debt cases need to be explained. To pay a debt is a duty, and upon payment the debt is discharged. However, even if payment is not made to discharge the debt, the parties may enter into a contract to terminate the duty otherwise than by payment in full. This contract consists of agreement (here referred to as “accord”), and consideration moving from the debtor (here called “satisfaction”).<br>&emsp;&emsp;The basic proposition within this area is that part payment is not of itself capable of being satisfaction, even if the accord makes it quite clear that the creditor receives it as such. This is referred to as the rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i>.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In fact a strictly systematic examination is difficult because the “ingredients” of promissory estoppel are closely interrelated and most of the cases therefore raise more than one of them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;High Trees</i> itself makes it clear that the doctrine requires a distinct promise not to enforce full contractual rights, and the accompanying intention to affect the legal relations between the parties.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">However, this is a curiously complicated topic. Hughes and the Birmingham case say nothing at all about promises; the equitable doctrine in those decisions refers only to conduct, as already noted. One possible reason for that has already been suggested above in the discussion immediately before the citation of High Trees – the likely awareness of the judges in those cases that an estoppel could not be based on a promise because of Jorden v Money. Therefore it seems correct for largely historical reasons to say that a clear promise (express or implied ) is required to support Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span>&#8216;s doctrine, but that some less unequivocal form of behaviour, for example acquiescence, may be sufficient to support a waiver of rights. Adams and Brownsword (Key Issues in Contract), in a lengthy discussion of waiver, suggest its effect is to prevent exercise of a remedial option as though no such waiver had occurred. For present purposes the best conclusion may be that a waiver, which stops short of an express inducement of a breach of contract, could well have a more limited effect than a full-blown promissory estoppel.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The promise must have been relied on by the promisee before it will found an estoppel.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The arrears of rent which were in fact owing were not the subject of the claim, and therefore Denning J&#8217;s assertion that they could not be recovered was merely obiter. In the next case, however, the conclusion that contractually due payments may be irrecoverable as a result of promissory estoppel can be taken to have the backing of the House of Lords.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-78'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Towards Promissory Estoppel</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Ajayi (EA) v Briscoe (see above)</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;“Their Lordships are of opinion that the principle of law as defined by Bowen LJ [in the <i>Birmingham</i> case] has been confirmed by the House of Lords in the case of <i>Tool Metal Manufacturing Co Ltd v Tungsten Electric Co Ltd</i> where the authorities were reviewed and no encouragement was given to the view that the principle was capable of extension so as to create rights in the promisee for which he had given no consideration. The principle, which has been described as quasi-estoppel and perhaps more aptly as promissory estoppel, is that when one party to a contract in the absence of fresh consideration agrees not to enforce his rights an equity will be raised in favour of the other party. The equity is, however, subject to the qualifications (1) that the other party has altered his position, (2) that the promisor can resile from his promise on giving reasonable notice, which need not be a formal notice, giving the promisee reasonable opportunity of resuming his position, (3) the promise only becomes final and irrevocable if the promisee cannot resume his position”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Promissory estoppel is an inherently defensive device. It gives effect to a promise unsupported by consideration in the sense that it allows that promise to be set up by its recipient as a defence to a claim that he has not performed in accordance with a contract. This is all is does. Certain conclusions logically follow. The most obvious is that promissory estoppel cannot be used as a cause of action, permitting the promisee to sue for breach of a promise. That can only be done if consideration has been given for the promise (or if it is made under seal, in a deed). A further conclusion, very closely related to the first, is that promissory estoppel can only operate within the context of a pre-existing contract. That, at least, remains the position in this jurisdiction.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-83'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Intention to Create Legal Relations</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Introduction</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;A simple explanation of the doctrine of intention to create legal relations can be given very briefly. As a matter of principle the enforceability of a contract depends not only on the facts of agreement and consideration, but also on the parties&#8217; intention to create legal relations. This intention is normally presumed to be absent from agreements made in the domestic and social spheres. It is strongly presumed to be present in the making of commercial agreements. However, each of these presumptions can be rebutted on the evidence.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As consideration came to appear to nineteenth and early twentieth century lawyers to be a body of definable rules (as opposed to a judicial discretion to enforce some contracts but not others), it was natural that a few cases should arise in which an application of those rules suggested enforceability while legal instinct suggested otherwise. The doctrine of intention to create legal relations can be understood as a means of giving a principled and limited basis to the use of discretion once it could no longer so easily be exercised under cover of finding or not finding “consideration”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Whether the doctrine necessarily means what its title suggests – that the parties should have meant their agreement to be legally enforceable – is open to doubt. The time when the doctrine first appears in English law is also the age of the ascendancy of freedom of contract, when any action of a court upon a contract tended to be explained in terms of what the parties could be taken to have intended when they made their agreement. The reference to “intention” reflects that preoccupation. Actual decisions, however, tend to be driven by a broader range of considerations than the parties&#8217; intentions. In fact it would be strange if the parties&#8217; actual intentions were determinative, given that the law does not usually concern itself with subjective intention. This perception is reinforced by a speech in the House of Lords in the following case.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Relevant factors will therefore be the likelihood that the parties did mean it to be brought before a court if necessary; corroborative reasons for supposing that; indications that the agreement was meant as an enduring and not merely a makeshift allocations of rights and burdens; the formal and accurate drafting to enable that inference to be made; the serious nature of the agreement&#8217;s subject matter, and the fact that it was relied upon, perhaps at length or regularly, and perhaps to the marked detriment of one of the parties to it. Where some but not all of these factors are present, it may be difficult to predict with assurance which way a case may go.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

If an offer, or an acceptance, is not meant seriously, then it is not an offer or an acceptance. To judge it by whether it evinces an intention to create legal relations is revisit an issue which is already largely resolved by more basic principles of contract formation. What is more, since the doctrine requires an assessment of the objective appearance of intention, rather than the subjective fact, it is draws very close to requiring the court to decide whether or not it is reasonable to support a contract. Viewed in that way, it hardly seems distinct from the doctrine of consideration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;At the same time there are calls for the ossified doctrine of consideration to be done away with in favour of the analysis of intention to create legal relations (see dicta in <i>Williams v Roffey</i> and <i>Chwee Kin Keong v Digilandmall.com Pte</i>, set out at the end of <span class="bd">McKendrick</span>&#8216;s chapter on intention to create legal relations). Such calls tend to overlook the fact that the search for intention to create legal relations is not an enquiry into the subjective intentions of the parties, but a quest for reasons from which to infer the binding character of their agreement.<br>&emsp;&emsp;These approaches seems to suggest a single and inescapable analysis. The name by which it is to be known is a matter of secondary importance. In some cases it can most clearly be put in terms of offer and acceptance. In others the language of consideration will serve better, and in others, the best explanation of the court&#8217;s assessment may be given in terms of intention to create legal relations. In every case, however, the objective must be to decide whether the parties&#8217; dealings are such as to justify legal consequences. In the words of Lord Blackburn in <i>Brogden v Directors of the Metropolitan Railway</i>, the question is whether they have done “an extraneous act which clenches the matter, and shows beyond all doubt that each side is bound”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The first almost exclusively concerns the incorporation of written clauses. Most of the cases in the second section concern oral statements. However, despite first appearances, the true distinction is not between what is written and what is oral. Rather, the first line of cases deals with the incorporation of provisions tending to diminish one party&#8217;s responsibilities under the contract, providing them with an answer to what would otherwise be a breach of contract. Typically these are exclusion or limitation clauses. The second line of cases deals with provisions which would add to one party&#8217;s contractual undertakings. These tend to be assurances or guarantees. Only a little imagination is needed to work out why the first class tends to be written, and the second oral.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Most authors allocate these two lines of cases to different chapters, which is understandable since different tests and policy considerations apply within the two fields. Nevertheless, the effect of that arrangement can be to obscure the fact that the common consideration across both fields is whether a stipulation has become contractual or not.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They asked her to sign a document entitled “Sales Agreement”, which she did, without reading it. The document included a general exclusion of all express or implied terms relating to the machine. When delivered, it failed to work properly and soon jammed. The plaintiff claimed damages for breach of an implied term that the machine would be fit for the purpose for which it was bought.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Divisional Court held that the exclusions in the contract had been legally incorporated into it by Miss L&#8217;Estrange&#8217;s signature, so that her action failed. The trial judge had been mistaken in finding that she had received insufficient notice of the exclusions. No question of notice arose, since the plaintiff&#8217;s signature was conclusive of her agreement to all the terms of the document.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Various objections could be made against this decision, although it cannot be doubted that it is correct in law. Miss L&#8217;Estrange had not read the document, and was therefore unaware of the effect of what she was signing. This point was summarily dismissed – the risk was hers. She said it had been misrepresented to her that the document was no more than an order form. On this point the evidence seemed insufficient to support her assertion, but it was recognised by the court that had her signature been procured by misrepresentation or fraud, or through her complete misapprehension as to the nature of the transaction (the very limited doctrine of “<i>non est factum</i>”), the exclusion would be invalid. The exclusion clauses had been in small print on brown paper, so that they were likely to be overlooked, but while this was regrettable it could not displace the legal effect of signature.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">This well-known case provides a further example of a limitation to the “ad idem” ideal of English contract law. It may seem superficially persuasive to submit that the plaintiff intended to make her purchase with the benefit of the law&#8217;s usual protections, while the defendants intended to sell to her on the basis that all those protections were ousted by the small print. In a sense the parties were therefore not in agreement. However, the value of certainty trumps the weaker “ad idem” principle. Signature proves assent, and it would be very unfortunate if one party&#8217;s ostensible assent could not be relied upon by the other. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The law&#8217;s concern to protect those who rely on another&#8217;s apparent assent, as evidenced by their signature, has no logical application where it should have been obvious that the assent was given on a mistaken basis. Here, the rationale of the snapping-up cases ought to apply to prevent the one party taking advantage of the other&#8217;s obvious mistake. Canadian law has gone this way, as the next case shows.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He was asked whether he wanted to purchase additional insurance cover, and said that he did. He was asked to sign a form and did so without reading it, as was apparent to the employee of the car rental company. On the back of the form were clauses in very small type which purported to make the defendant liable for damage done to the car.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal of Ontario held that the signature rule did not apply where it was or should have been clear that the customer had not read the contract and was not aware of the burdens it imposed. Reliance on signature was only justified where it was reasonable.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This broad Canadian exception to the rule in <i>L&#8217;Estrange v Graucob</i> is actually nothing more than the obverse of the rationale for the rule. Justifiable reliance on one party&#8217;s assent to the terms of the contract must be protected. Where, on the other hand, the reliance is not justified because it is apparent that the assent is not real, it should not be protected. That was the position here, where the parties&#8217; transaction had been relatively informal and hurried (in fact the speed with which car rental could be arranged was held out by the company as an attraction).<br>&emsp;&emsp;In favour of the rule in <i>L&#8217;Estrange v Graucob</i>, it at least has the virtues of being simple, clear, and widely known. One result of permitting the broad exception to it which appealed to the Canadian Court would presumably be to open the way to numerous cases in which the facts would not be clear-cut, but it could at least be argued that an exclusion clause had not been fully or properly understood. Beyond that, it seems odd that one party should effectively have the job of tutoring the other in the effects of the contract before being able to rely on its contents.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

As an alternative to the fact of signature, it may be possible to show that reasonable notice of the stipulation has been given. If so, the position once more is that the party introducing it must be able to rely on it, since the other has ostensibly agreed to it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The most basic point about reasonableness of notice is that it must be given before or at the time the contract is formed.

For instance in the <i>Shoe Lane Parking</i> case the court took notice of how completely the clause in question purported to shift risk to the plaintiff. In the <i>British Crane Hire</i> case, by contrast, the court was satisfied that the indemnity clause was entirely usual in a contract of a given type. In fact it is a recognised feature of the rules on incorporation by reasonable notice that the more onerous or unusual a stipulation is, the more that must be done before the court will be satisfied that reasonable notice of it has been given.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This principle was most famously expressed by <span class="bd">Denning LJ</span> in <i>Spurling v Bradshaw</i> (1956), where he said that “Some clauses which I have seen would need to be printed in red ink on the face of the document with a red hand pointing to it before the notice could be held to be sufficient”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is nevertheless a somewhat counter-intuitive state of affairs. One might imagine that the means by which stipulations are incorporated into contracts would be solely a matter of the mechanics of contract formation rather than of the consequences of being bound. Nonetheless, English contract law takes the view that the proffering of a page of clauses may result in some being incorporated and others not, according to their potential effect.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Terms which supplement the contract (warranties etc)</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The second half of this lecture deals with the incorporation of a different class of stipulations: those which increase the responsibility inherent in the contract&#8217;s performance, typically through the addition of a positive guarantee of some kind.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Most writers present this aspect of incorporation in the course of drawing a distinction between representations, which remain outside the contract, and warranties, which are contractual terms. It may be helpful to begin with an explanation of why the subject tends to be presented in that way, even though it is quite as much to do with the incorporation of stipulations into contracts as the topic covered in the first part of the lecture.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If a negative stipulation, such as an exclusion clause, is not found to be incorporated, it is ineffective. If a positive guarantee is not found to be incorporated, it may still take effect as a representation (sometimes referred to, particularly in older cases, as a “mere” representation). On the assumption that a representation has proved to be untrue – this is generally if not invariably at the centre of actions within this area – there may be a remedy for misrepresentation. However, prior to the passing of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, there was no general remedy by way of damages for a misrepresentation unless it had been made fraudulently. The relevant remedy would be rescission of the contract, which would restore the parties to the positions they would have been in had the contract not been made. However, rescission was often impossible on the facts.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Therefore it was in the interest of many plaintiffs to argue that a positive assurance which had motivated them to enter the contract had become one of its terms, so that they could seek damages for its breach. The cases, which are numerous, tend to dwell on the distinction between representations and contractual warranties, since that was plainly the live issue in most of them. Various tests were established, all going to that distinction, and to discuss the cases in connection with the distinction is simply to go with their grain. Still, it should be sufficient to observe that the test of timing with regard to the moment of contracting is as relevant here as it was in the earlier group of cases in order to see that beneath the surface we are concerned throughout with drawing the boundary around what is contractual.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Most, on a close reading, turn out to be heavily dependent on factual context, so that they cannot conveniently be separated from it for wider application. What little could be achieved by presenting such authorities individually would be outweighed by the burden of learning to which it would lead.

The rationale for this principle can be found in the combined values of certainty, finality, and respect for the parties&#8217; objectively recorded contractual intentions. The contract, so this reasoning would have it, is sacrosanct.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Nevertheless, no statement of the parol evidence rule would be complete without immediately adding the proviso that there are numerous exceptions to it. One of the most telling of them consists in the proposition that one may adduce “extrinsic” evidence to rebut the presumption that the contract is entire, and to show that the parties actually intended it to be in two parts – the formal document, and some other statement which was meant to stand with it on an equal footing. The adduction of such evidence does not “add to, vary or contradict” the contract. It merely shows that the contract exists in two places, and therefore indicates its true extent.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is not necessary to set out (or to learn) the intricacies of the rule in detail, at least for the purposes of this year. As far as the detail is concerned, the Law Commission in 1986 published a report on the rule, concluding that it required no amendment because in reality it never prevented the adduction of relevant evidence. <span class="bd">Treitel</span> took a more cautious view. Passages from the Law Commission&#8217;s report and <span class="bd">Treitel</span>&#8216;s response are reproduced in <span class="bd">McKendrick</span>&#8216;s textbook.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The point of present interest is that the parol evidence rule has in fact (and somewhat ironically) provided a way for English law to circumvent the obvious logical answer to the question about conflicting statements posed at the beginning of this section. To that logical answer there can be no response, but to a rule of evidence which covers the same ground, there can be exceptions. The two exceptions of greatest relevance are (a) that a pre-contractual statement may be said to enter the contract, despite inconsistent terms within it, as an express oral assurance which overrides the inconsistent terms, or (b) it may be regarded as a collateral contract.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

One means of lessening the difficulty is to reinterpret the situation as disclosing two contracts – the main agreement, and the oral assurance as a second agreement collateral to the first. A collateral contract basically has the same structure as a unilateral contract. It consists of an offer which is accepted by the doing of an act, namely entering into the main contract (this will also constitute the giving of consideration).</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

By contrast with almost all the material presented so far, this part of this lecture is designed to be read rather than learnt. This is not an area, it has to be admitted, in which a line of decided cases readily provides the concepts or devices with which to unlock problem questions. In fact contractual interpretation, as has often been remarked, is not much governed by the use of authority. Cases there are, but they amount to statements of judicial perspective rather than tools to use against facts. That being said, they do give direct insights into the character and indeed the success of this country&#8217;s commercial law.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In the case of incorporation, the stipulation in question is extant – it has been stated, or written, or displayed or referred to by one of the parties at some time before the contract is concluded. In the case of an implied term, the stipulation has no existence in relation to the contract until the case is before the court.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Broadly speaking, the law recognises four rationales for the implication of terms. They are<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) Implication from the parties&#8217; legal relationship (“terms implied in law”)<br>&emsp;&emsp;This lecture will deal with the first three. The most important aspects of the fourth, which really concerns the imposition of terms by a superior authority, will be set out in the next lecture.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It might well have been thought, until very recently, that the implication of terms was a self-contained subject – not the easiest, to be sure, but one around which a boundary could have been drawn with some assurance. However, Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span>n has now stepped into this arena, and proposed that the first three instances of implication above are in fact no more than aspects of the contextual interpretation of contracts. He made this proposal in a case cited at some length later in this lecture – <i>Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom</i> (2009).<br>&emsp;&emsp;We will first work through the standard sub-divisions of the law on implication of terms before addressing Lord Hoffmann&#8217;s insight.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The staple diet of the Commercial Court, as Lord Goff pointed out in a 1984 essay, may be summed up in a single word – “Construction”; but whichever way such problems are resolved, one party will always lose while the other wins. Provided justice is broadly done, could interpretation not be regarded as a matter of judicial technique with limited significance for the rest of the world?<br>&emsp;&emsp;An answer: it matters intensely that judges should be seen to understand the way that commerce works. There is more riding upon that than the doing of justice in individual cases. This country depends for its livelihood upon transactions. Those undertaking transactions need to be able to plan them in accordance with a body of rules which facilitates their working, and with confidence that judges will understand their dealings when applying the rules. The body of rules exists; for 250 years (essentially since the time of Lord Mansfield) English commercial law has formed itself through constant and remarkably close contact with the way in which merchants actually do business. Every new case raising a point of construction, however, is a new test of whether a judge has correctly grasped the character of what it is to which the rules must be applied. If the grasp is seen to be there, then it is the more likely that deals will continue to be done under English law, and may well be locally advised, financed, insured, reinsured and arbitrated. If the grasp fails, then the trade will go where it is better understood, or it will falter in its turn. The giving of commercially right answers is not a matter of judicial perfectionism. Commercial adjudication has consumers, and not just those who may be present in court.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span>n, in several of his most famous judicial pronouncements, has a tendency radically to simplify, sometimes in a way that leaves most others impressed but slightly incredulous.

Judges did not warm to the way in which parties with a dominant position would use standard form clauses, often hidden in small print, to deprive others of their contractual remedies. Exemption clauses have therefore tended to be “read down” though the application of the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule (the “proferens” is the party relying on such a clause). With the passing of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, there were strong expressions of judicial disapproval for the continuance of this practice, since the Act now provided a regular and legislatively ratified means of controlling such clauses. Nevertheless, in cases of ambiguity, the rule still applies, supported by the decisions of senior courts which Lord Hoffmann cannot be taken to have overruled.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the following case Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> tells the story of the rise and near fall of the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It has always been accepted that a court may need to go beyond the dictionary definitions of words where those words are ambiguous. However, Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span>&#8216;s proposition that the meaning of a document is not the same as the meaning of its words is clearly not confined to cases where ambiguity forces the court to have regard to context. It can be read as a general licence to courts, and therefore also to advocates, to approach contractual documents on the footing that they do not necessarily mean what they say. If the result is that the parties&#8217; objective intention is vindicated despite problems with their drafting, then all is well. If, on the other hand, the court adopts an over-ingenious interpretation which the parties never intended, then a serious blow is struck against the principles of certainty in commercial law (and against freedom of contract).</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

This seems so entirely unobjectionable that it may be surprising to see that there is a counter-argument. Where the court upholds the agreement in fact made, rather than discovering and enforcing one which would have been a better agreement, it does a great service to the value of certainty. Furthermore, a cautious approach to the construction of contracts is one for which people in business can prepare by making sure that they draft their documents with care. What they are powerless against is a court which illegitimately takes it upon itself to re-write documents.<br>&emsp;&emsp;However, the principle that an obvious mistake in drafting will not bind the court is qualified in Lord Hoffman&#8217;s restatement; it must be apparent that it does not represent the parties&#8217; intention. Therefore the decision to “correct” a mistake is taken by reference to the entire context from which the parties&#8217; intention appears, and not by reference to the scope for improvement.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Therefore there is no great controversy here, but instead an attitude of vigilance. The interpretation of contracts must remain in step with the assumptions of people in business, neither lagging behind them nor (albeit from the best of motives) rushing ahead.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In the case of incorporation, the stipulation in question is extant – it has been stated, or written, or displayed or referred to by one of the parties at some time before the contract is concluded.

It would seem natural to go straight on to deal with the terms implied (or more accurately imposed) by statute. However, the study of those terms will require you to address not only their content, but also their status. For that reason, it is most convenient to deal first with the status of contractual terms generally, in order to explain the common law scheme which Parliament has built upon in some of its most important commercial legislation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;That scheme, which comprises two levels of terms and associated remedies, is simple to the point of being rigid. Through the device of the “innominate” term, the common law has found a way beyond the limitations of its traditional approach, although it is one which exists in an uneasy tension with the value of certainty in commercial law.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The second part of the lecture is largely devoted to the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and reproduces the text of some of the most important sections of the Act with minimal comment. These are the sections which imply terms of primary importance into commercial contracts. For the purposes of this year, students are not expected to go further than to develop some familiarity with the most important provisions. These are printed in bold type. The surrounding sections of the Act are given by way of context and linkage.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The lecture touches on similar provisions in the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, and reproduces sections 13-15 of that Act, before turning to the changes made by the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The sections taken from the two earlier statutes are shown as amended by the 2015 legislation. This statutory material will be discussed to some extent in tutorials.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The distinction between warranties and conditions is of long standing, and became entrenched in English contract law after the Sale of Goods Act 1983 adopted it. The category of “intermediate” or “innominate” terms has been introduced into the law comparatively recently, by the 1962 judgment of <span class="bd">Diplock LJ</span> in the <i>Hong Kong Fir</i> case, and will be discussed in due course.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The distinction between warranties and conditions ultimately depends, like so much analysis of contract, upon the parties&#8217; intention. Nevertheless, although that may be the principled bedrock upon which the distinction is established, it will often be reached in practice by express analysis of how important the term in question is. Conditions are the more important terms of the contract. Warranties are the less important terms. The distinction is therefore drawn in a way which closely resembles the law&#8217;s approach to identifying pre-contractual statements as terms or representations.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The distinction has crucial consequences in terms of the remedies which will be available for breach of a given term.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The breach of condition brings about a more complex situation. The wronged party has a choice (or “election”) to make, since breach of condition creates the entitlement either to terminate the contract (and sue for damages as well if necessary), or to “accept the breach” and sue only for damages, while providing and hoping to receive continued performance of the contract.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It may seem slightly odd that a party would choose to forego the apparently superior remedy of termination. The answer is an entirely practical one. There could be more than one reason why the wronged party would not wish to terminate the contract, even though the law presents that option. For instance, the ongoing trading relationship with the party in breach may be of the utmost importance. Damages may well constitute sufficient compensation for the breach, while termination would destroy the commercial relationship.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The election, once made, is binding. If it is decided only to sue for damages in connection with a breach of condition, then further performance under the contract remains due from either party. There can be no second thoughts. Equally, if it is decided to terminate the contract, it cannot later be revived.<br>&emsp;&emsp;More than that turns on the election. If one party purports to terminate the contract on account of the other&#8217;s breach of condition, the other may object (and perhaps later prove in court) that the term breached was not a condition but merely a warranty, or even that no term was breached. If that is so, then the termination of contract will itself be a breach – wrongful repudiation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is therefore of the utmost importance that the law on this topic should be clear, so that parties can know with certainty what rights they have. That being said, there is a competing legal value which creates tension in this area. While being certain, the law also needs to deliver a proportionate scheme of remedies. It therefore needs to show a degree of elasticity.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-167'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Classification of Terms - Classification of Terms - Conditions</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Conditions</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;One way in which the parties can (in theory) ensure clarity and at least some proportionality is by classifying their obligations themselves at the time of contracting as either conditions or warranties. The question, as the next case shows, is whether a court will feel bound to accept such a classification.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The parties entered into a “distributorship agreement” by which Wickman was to act as agent in obtaining buyers for panel presses manufactured by Schuler, a German company. The agreement was to last for four and a half years. Clause 7(b) of the agreement stated that “it shall be condition of this agreement that (i) [Wickman] shall send its representatives to visit [the six large UK motor manufacturers] at least once in every week for the purpose of soliciting orders for panel presses ...”. Clause 11a gave to either party the right to terminate the agreement if the other had committed a material breach which remained unremedied within sixty days of the other&#8217;s notice in writing. Wickman did not make all the weekly visits required by the agreement. Schuler terminated it immediately, claiming that Wickman was in breach of condition, and that by its nature the breach could not be remedied. Since the possibility of remedy under clause 11 had no application on this view, Schuler claimed the ordinary remedy for breach of condition untrammelled by the need to give a sixty day warning.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held, by a majority, that Schuler had had no entitlement to terminate the contract. Lord Reid said that the agreement was badly drafted, but that one available construction (avoiding absurdity) was that a few missed visits could be remedied by improving procedures for the future. Schuler should therefore have acted in accordance with the provisions of clause 11, rather than immediately terminating the contract. Lord Wilberforce, dissenting, was of the view that there was no basis for the assumption that the parties had adopted “a standard of easygoing tolerance rather than one of aggressive, insistent punctuality and efficiency”, and that the drafting of the agreement in fact indicated the latter.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;In the following explanation by Lord Reid of his reasoning, the reference to “rescinding” the contract should be read as “terminating the contract”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Schuler maintains that the word &#8220;condition&#8221; has now acquired a precise legal meaning; that, particularly since the enactment of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, its recognised meaning in English law is a term of a contract any breach of which by one party gives to the other party an immediate right to rescind the whole contract. Undoubtedly the word is frequently used in that sense. There may, indeed, be some presumption that in a formal legal document it has that meaning. But it is frequently used with a less stringent meaning. One is familiar with printed &#8220;Conditions of Sale&#8221; incorporated into a contract, and with the words &#8220;For conditions see back&#8221; printed on the ticket. There it simply means that the &#8220;conditions&#8221; are terms of the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the ordinary use of the English language &#8220;condition&#8221; has many meanings, some of which have nothing to do with agreements. In connection with an agreement it may mean a pre-condition: something which must happen or be done before the agreement can take effect. Or it may mean some state of affairs which must continue to exist if the agreement is to remain in force. The legal meaning on which Schuler relies is, I think, one which would not occur to a layman; a condition in that sense is not something which has an automatic effect. It is a term the breach of which by one party gives to the other an option either to terminate the contract or to let the contract proceed and, if he so desires, sue for damages for the breach.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes a breach of a term gives that option to the aggrieved party because it is of a fundamental character going to the root of the contract, sometimes it gives that option because the parties have chosen to stipulate that it shall have that effect. Blackburn J. said in <b><i>Bettini v Gye </i></b>(1875) L.R. 1 Q.B.D. 183: <i>&#8220;Parties may think some matter, apparently of very<br>&emsp;&emsp;little importance, essential; and if they sufficiently express an intention to make the literal fulfilment of such a thing a condition precedent, it will be one.&#8221;<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the present case it is not contended that Wickman&#8217;s failures to make visits amounted in themselves to fundamental breaches. What is contended is that the terms of clause 7 <i>&#8220;sufficiently express an intention </i>&#8220; to make any breach, however small, of the obligation to make visits a condition so that any such breach shall entitle Schuler to rescind the<br>&emsp;&emsp;Schuler maintains that the use of the word &#8220;condition&#8221; is in itself enough to establish this intention. No doubt some words used by lawyers do have a rigid inflexible meaning. But we must remember that we are seeking to discover intention as disclosed by the contract as a whole. Use of the word &#8220;condition&#8221; is an indication—even a strong indication—of such an<br>&emsp;&emsp;ntention but it is by no means conclusive. The fact that a particular construction leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration. The more unreasonable the result the more unlikely it is that the parties can have intended it, and if they do intend it the more<br>&emsp;&emsp;necessary it is that they shall make that intention abundantly clear”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;As Professor <span class="bd">McKendrick</span> notes, the key to understanding this case lies in the relationship between clauses 7 and 11 of the parties&#8217; contract. He concludes, surely rightly, that if no more had been in play than the agreement&#8217;s characterisation of even a single, venial breach as a breach of condition, then there would have been very little basis for arguing that it was not a condition. That drafting would have been a clear indication of the parties&#8217; intention. However, clause 11 provided contractual machinery which the majority thought capable of barring the consequence that any breach should immediately justify termination.<br>&emsp;&emsp;McKendrick also makes the valuable point that the majority&#8217;s decision left Schuler liable for wrongfully repudiating the contract. Wickman was therefore free to accept that breach (if it wished), and sue Schuler for all the profits which Wickman could show it would have earned over the lifetime of the agency. As for Schuler&#8217;s action for what it had thought to be a “breach of condition”, it would have been downgraded to the right to bring a counterclaim for such damage as it could show was caused by the missed visits.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Despite these somewhat surprising consequences of the majority&#8217;s decision, <i>Schuler v Wickman</i> stands as the leading authority in English law on the distinction between conditions and warranties.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The interpretation section of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 defines a warranty as “collateral to the main purpose of the contract”, and this must be contrasted with the frequent observation in the cases that conditions “go to the root of the contract”. “Collateral” here seems to have much the sense of “secondary” or “inessential”. The fact is that the words “warranty” and “condition” have often been used in English law with no apparent precision, but rather to point up the difference of something from something else (compare the various ways in which the expression “common law” has been used to mark a distinction – from equity, from statute, from civilian law, etc).<br>&emsp;&emsp;Glosses upon the meaning of “warranty” in some decisions accordingly need to be treated warily. For example, where “warranty” is used in the cases to contrast with non-contractual “representations”, it has already been seen that one supposed characteristic of a warranty is the emphasis placed upon it, or even its decisive effect upon one party&#8217;s willingness to contract with the other. These associations of the word really have to be put away as irrelevant to the present topic, or even misleading.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

This is because it is based upon the intention of the parties, and their intention must appear from the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Once the contract is formed, there is no further guide to the parties&#8217; intentions, so that there is no reason for the courts to look beyond that point in time. Clearly, courts do in fact look beyond that point in time in so far as they compare performance of the contract with its terms in order to decide whether there has been a breach, but traditionally they do not do so in order to construe the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If, however, one&#8217;s concern is with the proportionality of the remedy for breach of contract provided by the law, it may be of the greatest importance to look beyond the moment of contract formation to the breach which has actually occurred. Whatever the importance of the term which has been breached, proportionality must partly consist in the remedy being suited to the <i>breach</i>, and not just to the <i>term</i>. It may well be that a very important term could be breached in a very minor way, causing little loss, and vice versa. An appropriate remedy is one which most truly offers compensation for loss in fact suffered.<br>&emsp;&emsp;We should therefore enter the field of innominate terms aware that the orthodox approach to the classification of a term refuses to be influenced by the nature of the breach, while a different perspective characterises the actual breach as possibly decisive.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The current law does not place any controls upon the making of this election, so that it can be informed purely by commercial opportunism. Professor Brownsword, in “Retrieving Reasons, Retrieving Rationality? A New Look at the Right to Withdraw for Breach of Contract” (1992) 5 Journal of Contract Law, 83, examines the principles which could be applied in this context. In the course of doing so, he helpfully sheds light on the reasons which might be given by a party seeking to terminate a contract for breach:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Without any claim to being exhaustive of possible good reasons, six arguable grounds for the right to withdraw may be suggested as follows:<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1) the contract breaker evinces, through the breach, a lack of commitment to the contract as a source of obligation (for example, the breach is intentional/calculating, or fraud/dishonesty is involved);<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) the breach raises concerns about the competence of the contract-breaker (for example, the breach involves negligence);<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) the breach, although unintentional and non-negligent, renders performance under the contract radically different from that envisaged at formation;<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) proving (or quantifying) losses flowing from the breach gives rise to difficulties which put the innocent party at risk;<br>&emsp;&emsp;(5) the breach gives rise to concern about the contract-breaker&#8217;s ability to meet future claims; and<br>&emsp;&emsp;(6) the breach gives rise to concern about the <i>innocent</i> party&#8217;s own ability to perform either the contract in question of another&#8217;s associated contract”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Professor Brownsword goes on to suppose, within this exercise in imagining how the law might reasonably be, that the party claiming the right to withdraw would need to make out a prima facie case for the applicability of one of the reasons above, and would need to be acting in good faith. The onus would then shift to the other party to rebut the other&#8217;s case.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It must be stressed that the above proposals are not law – the assertion of the right to terminate is at the sole discretion of the wronged party. However, the scheme above offers a useful insight into some of the practical considerations which presumably inform that exercise of discretion even on the present state of the law. It is also instructive to notice that Brownsword&#8217;s proposals move in the opposite direction from one aspect of <span class="bd">Diplock LJ</span>&#8216;s analysis in the Hong Kong Fir. Termination, on that jurisprudential analysis, tended to be seen as the default position, if not as technically automatic.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It continues through sections 13, 14 and 15, imposing implied conditions as to good title, description, quality and correspondence with sample on non-consumer contracts for the sale of goods. The reason for the initial statement of a “term” and its later specification as a “condition”, is that the Act applies in Scotland as well as England, Wales and Northern Ireland; its structure, and the use of square brackets around certain words or sections, are indications that the text diverges at these points into a local version for each jurisdiction.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Section 15A: This new section was introduced by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994. It addresses a problem inherent in the condition/warranty dichotomy which governs this part of the Sale of Goods Act. Since breach of a condition entitles the wronged party to opt for termination of the contract, even though he may have suffered no damage as a result of the breach, there were several cases prior to 1994 in which parties did exactly that in order to escape a bad bargain (see, for example, <i>Moore v Landauer</i> (1921)). The new section puts a stop to this practice. Its introduction creates a necessary elasticity in the scheme of remedies under the Act, comparable to the effect of the innominate term analysis in broader commercial law.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This Act takes the structure and content of the main run of implied terms in the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (sections 12 – 15A), and applies them with virtually no modifications to contracts for the <b>transfer of property in goods</b>, and contracts for the <b>hire of goods</b>. Like the Sale of Goods Act, the 1982 Act no longer applies to consumer contracts, which are now governed by the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Changes made by that Act are printed below in italics.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is not always easy to determine whether a contract is one for the sale of goods or for the supply of goods and services. Perhaps surprisingly, the boundary between the two types of contract is not rigorously established. Chapter 2 of Atiyah, Adams and MacQueen&#8217;s <i>The Sale of Goods</i> deals exhaustively with this topic. Often, little will turn on which side of the boundary a case is put, since the provisions on either side of the divide are so similar.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Contracts for the <b>supply of a service</b> are dealt with completely separately. Since this part of the 1982 Act includes one implied term of immense importance relating to care and skill, and two more which deserve to be learnt, it is reproduced here in full (sections 13-15).<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1) In this Act a “relevant contract for the supply of a service” means, subject to subsection (2) below, a contract under which a person (“the supplier”) agrees to carry out a service<i>, other than one to which Chapter 4 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) For the purposes of this Act, a contract of service or apprenticeship is not a contract for the supply of a service.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) Subject to subsection (2) above, a contract is a contract for the supply of a service for the purposes of this Act whether or not goods are also—<br>&emsp;&emsp;under the contract, and whatever is the nature of the consideration for which the service is to be carried out.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) The Secretary of State may by order provide that one or more of sections 13 to 15 below shall not apply to services of a description specified in the order, and such an order may make different provision for different circumstances.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(5) The power to make an order under subsection (4) above shall be exercisable by statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>In a <i>relevant</i> contract for the supply of a service where the supplier is acting in the course of a business, there is an implied term that the supplier will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>(1) Where, under a <i>relevant</i> contract for the supply of a service by a supplier acting in the course of a business, the time for the service to be carried out is not fixed by the contract, left to be fixed in a manner agreed by the contract or determined by the course of dealing between the parties, there is an implied term that the supplier will carry out the service within a reasonable time.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>(1) Where, under a <i>relevant</i> contract for the supply of a service, the consideration for the service is not determined by the contract, left to be determined in a manner agreed by the contract or determined by the course of dealing between the parties, there is an implied term that the party contracting with the supplier will pay a reasonable charge.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1)Where a right, duty or liability would arise under a <i>relevant</i> contract for the supply of a service by virtue of this Part of this Act, it may (subject to subsection (2) below and the 1977 Act) be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both parties to the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2 )An express term does not negative a term implied by this Part of this Act unless inconsistent with it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(a) any rule of law which imposes on the supplier a duty stricter than that imposed by section 13 or 14 above; or<br>&emsp;&emsp;(b) subject to paragraph (a) above, any rule of law whereby any term not inconsistent with this Part of this Act is to be implied in a contract for the supply of a service.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) This Part of this Act has effect subject to any other enactment which defines or restricts the rights, duties or liabilities arising in connection with a service of any description.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It is probable that the terms in sections 13 and 14 are in fact innominate. Section 15 seems merely to introduce a mechanism into contracts which would not give rise to the sequence of breach and remedy, and therefore does not require further definition.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This long and complex piece of legislation, brought into force on 1 October 2015, has produced the most significant overhaul of consumer law in decades. It governs contracts for goods and for services between traders and consumers, to which the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 have now ceased to apply. The rights and protections which were formerly derived from them are re-enacted in a more sophisticated form, with a tiered system of remedies. The Act also deals comprehensively with contracts for the supply of digital content.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Act has also taken over the functions of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 with regard to consumer contracts. This will be further discussed in the next lecture, which deals with the control of exemption clauses.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The main terms implied by the Act into contracts for the sale or supply of goods are that they should:<br>&emsp;&emsp;· Be fit for a particular purpose (if such a purpose was expressly or impliedly made known) (s. 10);<br>&emsp;&emsp;Broadly similar provisions in Chapter 3 of the Act cover the supply of digital content.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>The scheme of remedies</b> (this is complex, and only a schematic introduction is given here).<br>&emsp;&emsp;The consumer has the right to reject and receive a full refund. This right terminates after 30 days (sooner if the goods are perishable).<br>&emsp;&emsp;This right also arises on transfer of ownership or delivery, but continues beyond the 30 day period.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>Tier 3</b> – rejection and refund, or retention and price reduction<br>&emsp;&emsp;This right exists for 6 months from transfer of ownership or delivery, but can be claimed only after the second tier remedy has been exercised, or proved impossible.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Chapter 4 of the 2015 Act governs contracts for the supply of services. At its core are provisions similar to those of the equivalent part of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, including the requirement that a service must be performed with reasonable care and skill (s.49). S.54 sets out the rights which arise upon breach. These include the right to repeat performance and the right to a price reduction, while the availability of other contractual remedies is preserved (short of double recovery, of course). The s.49 provision as to reasonable care and skill cannot be excluded.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The key provision determining the applicability of the Act is given in s.2, where “trader” is defined as “a person acting for purposes relating to that person&#8217;s trade, business, craft or profession”, and “consumer” is defined as “an individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individual&#8217;s trade, business, craft or profession”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

On the assumption that a clause has been validly incorporated into a contract, and before any question of whether the clause can stand against relevant legislation (principally the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Consumer Rights Act 2015), it is necessary to ask whether it covers the breach of contract which has in fact occurred.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The second part of this lecture sets out and to some extent examines the impact of legislation on exemption clauses.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The first topic, however, is part of the interpretation of contracts. Special rules governing the construction of exemption clauses may be said to be part of the “old intellectual baggage of “legal” interpretation” which has been almost completely discarded, according to Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span>n&#8217;s restatement of the principles of interpretation in <i>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society</i> [1988] 1 WLR 896. However, as pointed out in the lecture on that topic, Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span>n may have overstated the case. There is a great deal of learning on the construction of exemption clauses. Much of it (perhaps not all) makes sense. As Lord Wilberforce used to say, one should not so readily discard reasoned authorities. Some of the main approaches taken in those authorities are set out here for information, and to promote an awareness of the way in which the law has developed within this field.<br>&emsp;&emsp;To pave the way for that examination, it seems appropriate to begin by contrasting and explaining two views which could plausibly be taken of exemption clauses. The first is memorably expressed by Professor <span class="bd">McKendrick</span> at the beginning of his chapter on the topic. They could be regarded as a social nuisance. They may be imposed upon a contracting party who lacks any real opportunity to take issue with them, or the commercial clout to insist that they should be modified. Exemption clauses may then be used to stultify the law in so far as they may be set up against the remedy which the law would otherwise give for an admitted and perhaps grave breach of contract. It is not surprising, where this is the context, that the courts have tended to construe them narrowly.<br>&emsp;&emsp;On the other hand, exemption clauses in the business to business context may perform a useful function. Absent any presumption that one experienced and well-advised party is likely to be oppressing another of comparable bargaining power and resilience, exemption clauses may be seen as one means of fine-tuning a contract. They indicate where risk is to lie, so saving the need to go to law. They provide protections to parties which may enable them to take on roles which otherwise would be too risky. They may well be used together with an insurance back-up for the party who is to take the burden of them. At their best, they can be a means of facilitating a transaction which it would otherwise be impractical to undertake.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The basic principle running right through the common law&#8217;s attitude to exemption clauses is that within certain limits (unfortunately not well defined) they will be effective if sufficiently clearly drafted.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Strictly, <i>contra proferentem</i> construction comes into its own where there is an ambiguity in an exemption clause, and therefore a choice of ways for the court to go. The ambiguity will be resolved against the party who is seeking to rely on the exemption.<br>&emsp;&emsp;More basically than this, however, the courts&#8217; manner of reading exemption clauses is narrow, even where it may be difficult to articulate an ambiguity which provides the courts with a choice. This is almost certainly still the case, notwithstanding Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span>n&#8217;s remarks in <i>West Bromwich</i>. It is hard to argue that narrow reading is not an appropriate way to construe exemption clauses. After all, they have traditionally been seen as excuses which become relevant only when one party has breached its primary obligations.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Here, a broad distinction is traditionally drawn between clauses which exclude liability altogether, and those which limit it to an agreed maximum amount payable by way of compensation. It is said that while the narrow approach applies to either type of clause, it applies with greater rigour against exclusions; see the House of Lords&#8217; case <i>Ailsa Craig Fishing Co Ltd v Malvern Fishing Co Ltd and Securicor (Scotland) Ltd</i> [1983] 1 WLR 964. This position has also been criticised on the ground that some limitation clauses may be more onerous than certain exclusion clauses. On the other hand, that will not generally be the case. It would not be difficult to take the debate further, but here is not the place.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If an exemption clause is repugnant to the contract itself, it may well be deprived of effect by the courts. However, the basis for intervening has long been a problem with significant conceptual ramifications.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

This was an attractive notion in one respect (if only the one). Rather than requiring the court to deduce the invalidation of an exemption clause from the character of the breach, it made its invalidation consequent upon one party&#8217;s uncontroversial entitlement to bring the contract to an end for breach of condition. Unfortunately it is simply wrong to assert that the termination of the contract deprives it of further effect. It remains as the instrument which created and maintains the wronged party&#8217;s right to recover damages, and its exemption clauses stand by the same token.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Denning was also of the view that an exemption clause would automatically cease to operate if the contract was breached in such a way which was fundamental, in the sense that the breach went to the root of the contract. Here, he was building on a rule of construction, namely that in these circumstances it will not normally be taken to be the parties&#8217; intention that the contract should exclude such liability. However, the doctrine associated with Lord Denning made this rule substantive or absolute, to the effect that exemption clauses in his view and that of other members of the Court of Appeal were quite simply ineffective in cases of fundamental breach.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Unfortunately even this corrective statement of principle needs a further note. Something very like the substantive doctrine of fundamental breach does validly operate in two linked classes of commercial contracts. In contracts for the carriage of goods, and contracts of bailment (by which goods are deposited to be kept and later restored by the bailee), any deviation from the agreed voyage, or diversion of the goods from where they were to be kept, will take the defendant “outside the four quarters of the contract” and beyond the protective reach of exclusion clauses. It is not easy to account for this special strictness in principled terms, except by renewed reference to the “peas and beans” analysis; the plaintiff has agreed a specific voyage, and therefore a different voyage cannot be the subject of the agreement or benefit from protective clauses built into it. Quite possibly a more penetrating account of these cases is the one given by Lord Wilberforce in passing in <i>Photo Productions</i>: “It may be preferable that they should be considered as a body of authority sui generis with special rules derived from historical and commercial reasons”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He says that “the liability of the defendant apart from the exempting words must be ascertained”, and only then do those words fall to be considered as a possible defence to an action for breach of contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This is not the only way in which exempting words in contracts could be understood. An alternative approach has been strongly advocated by Professor Coote in <i>Exception Clauses</i> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1964). It will indicate why he prefers “exception” to “exemption”. His view is that exemptions are no different from any other provisions in contracts. They should therefore inform the view taken of what the primary contractual obligations are, since it is artificial to decide those obligations in isolation from clauses which in fact modify them from the outset. The examples given by Professor Coote to contrast the defensive conception of exemptions with their role in defining duties ab initio are (a) the sale of a horse warranted to be sound, but an exclusion of liability for its performance in hunting; and (b) the same horse warranted sound except for hunting.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Professor Coote goes further, regarding the defensive understanding of exemptions as fallacious and impossible:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“...the true juristic function and effect of exception clauses are quite different from those currently ascribed to them by the courts. Instead of being mere shields to claims based on breach of accrued rights, exception clauses substantively delimit the rights themselves... It may seem feasible that the parties should have intended a contractual duty to remain when they excluded liability for its breach, but this is in reality a juristic impossibility. A duty of sorts there may be, but it will be a duty of honour, not a contractual one. It would follow, then, that the current approach to exception clauses is based on a fallacy”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Against this view, it should be pointed out that the long-standing practice of the courts is to view exemptions as defences, and that Scrutton LJ&#8217;s analysis cited above is therefore entirely mainstream. Certainly it would be wise for the purposes of this year to follow the procedure of asking (1) what the contract promised; (2) whether it was performed or breached; and (3) if breached, whether it includes an exemption which on its true construction provides a defence against the breach in question.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Perhaps the real significance of Professor Coote&#8217;s duty-defining approach is seen in the context of legislation dealing with exemption clauses. Section 3 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act (“Liability arising in Contract”) is drafted in such a way as to control the type of exemption clauses which stand as defences to breach, but also those which in accordance with Coote&#8217;s understanding define and limit contractual undertakings in the first place. That being so, it must be recognised that the Act goes further than to set limits to contracting out of breach. It sets limits to free contracting.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

As a result of the 2015 Act which governs consumer contracts, UCTA 1977 now applies exclusively to non-consumer contracts.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The aim this year is to build up a working grasp of the conditions for the Act&#8217;s application, and the main classes of term to which it applies. This is not a minor nor a straightforward task. Think in terms of mapping pathways through the apparatus of the Act. Often, it will be necessary to begin by examining threshold questions which affect the Act&#8217;s relevance to the facts under examination. Then, assuming that the Act does apply, it will be necessary to say accurately which section controls the term in question. If the Act subjects the term to a reasonableness test, it will then be a matter of choosing the correct reasonableness test (section 11 of the Act contains four such tests). All of these are fairly workaday tasks, or at least they can be approached in that way. However, they are rather more of a challenge if you have not developed familiarity with the structure and content of the Act itself.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Rather than interrupt the text with notes, it has seemed most useful for the purposes of this year to append to it some indications of typical ways through the Act. First, read Part 1. Changes made by the Consumer Rights Act 2015 are printed in italics. The 2015 Act has made UCTA shorter than it was, but unfortunately it has also made it more complex.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It may be the right starting point if a contract term seems onerous, but not a normal exemption clause<br>&emsp;&emsp;You may have noticed, reading through Part 1, that it includes some introductory provisions, then it asserts its control over various types of contract terms or other terms. That central section ends with section 7. In fact what may be regarded as the central part of the Act (that is, sections 2 – 7) is said by <b>section 1(3)</b> to apply only to business liability, save that section 6 is not limited in this way. Given that you are likely to want to use one of these central sections, it is of obvious importance to check whether you are dealing with business liability.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Among the “central” sections, <b>section 3</b> is likely to be of frequent relevance (“liability arising in contract”). Notice that its application is limited to instances where one contracting party deals on the other&#8217;s written standard terms of business. There is no legislative definition of “written standard terms of business”. There is some caselaw on the topic.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Those are the likely preliminary matters, some or all of which may need to be discussed before the Act can actually be used for its main purpose.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The central <b>sections 2-7</b> vary in difficulty. An application of section 2 (negligence liability) might well be easy. By contrast, there are aspects of section 3 (liability arising in contract) which might be more challenging, perhaps because of the drafting of that section. Section 6 (sale and hire purchase) is difficult because of the relatively complex interlocking with the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982. However, the difficulty is not conceptual. With a good grasp of the sections of those two acts which were set out in the last lecture, it should be straightforward to settle who can exclude liability for what, or can do so subject to a reasonableness test.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If a clause is made subject to a reasonableness test by the Act, then the place to look in order to run that test is <b>section 11</b>. Since section 11 in fact contains four tests, it is essential to choose the correct one. The beginning words of each subsection indicate which is the appropriate one, depending on the central section from which you have come.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Only section 11(2) explicitly requires the consideration of reasonableness to be assessed in accordance with the <b>Schedule 2</b> criteria set out above. However, there is authority that Schedule 2 may be referred to whenever the question of a term&#8217;s reasonableness is to be judged.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In deciding whether a term is reasonable or not, you are not required to go very far into the facts for the purposes of this year. This year, the key to handling the Unfair Contract Terms Act is to find a pathway through it which is not wrong, and to show a good understanding of where the materials required for fuller argument would be found.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Amongst the other functions of the Act is to continue a well-established legislative trend towards making the control of exemptions the work of regulators, not merely of courts. The central section is s.62, which is printed below. S62(4) deserves to be committed to memory.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) This does not prevent the consumer from relying on the term or notice if the consumer chooses to do so.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) A term is unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties&#8217; rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(b) by reference to all the circumstances existing when the term was agreed and to all of the other terms of the contract or of any other contract on which it depends.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(6) A notice is unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties&#8217; rights and obligations to the detriment of the consumer.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(b) by reference to all the circumstances existing when the rights or obligations to which it relates arose and to the terms of any contract on which it depends.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Other important provisions of the 2015 Act&#8217;s regulation of exemptions are the following, certain aspects of which are surprising:<br>&emsp;&emsp;· S.64 prohibits the assessment of the fairness of a term to the extent that it specifies the main subject matter of the contract, or the assessment would be of the price payable (the two sides of the <i>quid pro quo</i>). This is done in order to protect the principle of freedom of contract. However, to escape assessment, the term in question must be “transparent and prominent”. The section in fact rests upon a number of value judgments, which is ironic since part of its function is to avoid scrutiny of value. It does not look straightforward to apply.<br>&emsp;&emsp;· S.65 repeats UCTA&#8217;s ban on the exclusion or restriction of liability for negligence causing personal injury or death. The section&#8217;s heading, “Bar on exclusion or restriction of negligence liability” appears to be misleadingly broad, since the bar does not apply to exclusions of lesser consequences of negligence.<br>&emsp;&emsp;· S.68 places an obligation on a trader to “ensure that a written term of a consumer contract, or a consumer notice in writing, is transparent”. Transparency requires expression “in plain and intelligible language”, and legibility. It is again ironic that this section itself appears to be poorly drafted, in that its definition of transparency is related only to notices, and not to terms. The Act&#8217;s explanatory notes regard the definition as extending to terms as well.<br>&emsp;&emsp;· S69 provides that an ambiguous term or notice is to receive the interpretation most favourable to the consumer. This appears to be a codification of the common law&#8217;s <i>contra proferentem</i> approach to the construction of exemptions.<br>&emsp;&emsp;· S71 obliges courts to consider whether terms are fair even if no party the proceedings has raised the issue. This is subject to the proviso that the court must be satisfied that it has sufficient legal and factual material to enable the assessment to be made.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>Schedule 2</b> of the Act gives an indicative and non-exhaustive list of terms (often referred to as “the grey list”) which may be regarded as unfair, and is based on a similar list in the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 which the 2015 Act revokes.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The list is a substantial one, and it is not expected that you will learn it. Nevertheless, it is interesting, not least because it confirms the validity (whilst of course putting in question the fairness) of certain types of arrangement about which you might have felt some doubt at the level of contract formation. You would do well to read through it two or three times. For that reason, it is set out below.<br>&emsp;&emsp;1 A term which has the object or effect of excluding or limiting the trader&#8217;s liability in the event of the death of or personal injury to the consumer resulting from an act or omission of the trader.<br>&emsp;&emsp;2 A term which has the object or effect of inappropriately excluding or limiting the legal rights of the consumer in relation to the trader or another party in the event of total or partial non-performance or inadequate performance by the trader of any of the contractual obligations, including the option of offsetting a debt owed to the trader against any claim which the consumer may have against the trader.<br>&emsp;&emsp;3 A term which has the object or effect of making an agreement binding on the consumer in a case where the provision of services by the trader is subject to a condition whose realisation depends on the trader&#8217;s will alone.<br>&emsp;&emsp;4 A term which has the object or effect of permitting the trader to retain sums paid by the consumer where the consumer decides not to conclude or perform the contract, without providing for the consumer to receive compensation of an equivalent amount from the trader where the trader is the party cancelling the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;5 A term which has the object or effect of requiring that, where the consumer decides not to conclude or perform the contract, the consumer must pay the trader a disproportionately high sum in compensation or for services which have not been supplied.<br>&emsp;&emsp;6 A term which has the object or effect of requiring a consumer who fails to fulfil his obligations under the contract to pay a disproportionately high sum in compensation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;7 A term which has the object or effect of authorising the trader to dissolve the contract on a discretionary basis where the same facility is not granted to the consumer, or permitting the trader to retain the sums paid for services not yet supplied by the trader where it is the trader who dissolves the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;8 A term which has the object or effect of enabling the trader to terminate a contract of indeterminate duration without reasonable notice except where there are serious grounds for doing so.<br>&emsp;&emsp;9 A term which has the object or effect of automatically extending a contract of fixed duration where the consumer does not indicate otherwise, when the deadline fixed for the consumer to express a desire not to extend the contract is unreasonably early.<br>&emsp;&emsp;10 A term which has the object or effect of irrevocably binding the consumer to terms with which the consumer has had no real opportunity of becoming acquainted before the conclusion of the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;11 A term

The aim here has been to present it in a way which maximises understanding while minimising overload. Once the basic rules are grasped, the area will be seen to be one which allows rather more use of the imagination than actions for breach of contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This first lecture on the subject is concerned with the ingredients of liability (a) for misrepresentation, whether fraudulent, negligent or innocent; and (b) for negligent misstatement. The need to contrast misrepresentation and misstatement actions is emphasised.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The second lecture broadly tracks the Misrepresentation Act 1967, a short but sometimes puzzling piece of legislation. The lecture includes detailed discussion of fraudulent, negligent and innocent misrepresentation, focusing on the remedies available for each. The remedy of rescission is an important subject in its own right, since it is necessary to be aware not only of its effect but also of factors (the bars to rescission) which may make it unavailable. The second lecture also deals with attempts to exclude liability for misrepresentation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Two topics within misrepresentation have a particular tendency to prolong treatments of the subject to the point at which it may begin to seem impossibly detailed. One is the relationship between silence and misrepresentation, which is given concise handling here. The other is the quantum of damages for misrepresentation. This is also given as light a treatment here as possible.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

This is certainly not wrong, but it can lead to confusion. The problem is that the notion of inducement can be understood in different ways. It can refer to the extent to which the mind of the representee was actually affected by the statetment made. It can refer to the propensity of the statement to encourage reliance. In a phrase such as “in order to induce...”, it can import the idea that the representor must have intended the statement to have that effect (some older cases expressly state that requirement, whilst some others disavow it).<br>&emsp;&emsp;For the purpose of accurate analysis, the language of inducement is best avoided altogether. It has not been avoided in recent decisions, so that confusion remains.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Inducement can be translated with advantage by the concepts of materiality and reliance, an approach favoured by <span class="bd">Treitel</span>. Materiality, when correctly understood, refers to the capacity of the statement made to affect the mind of a reasonable representee. It is an objective measure of the statement&#8217;s significance. Reliance is an assessment of whether the statement did in fact play a real and substantial part in the representee&#8217;s decision whether (or at least on what terms) to enter the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This approach, consisting of objective and subjective measurements of the statement&#8217;s impact, is more likely to lead to clarity than attempts to cover the same ground by looking for “inducement”. One remaining problem is that the law remains unclear about the relationship between materiality, reliance, and where the burden of proof should lie. For the purposes of this year, that problem (although a real one) is not going to be over-stated.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Recent cases, such as Raifeissen Zentralbank Osterreich v Royal Bank of Scotland (2011) have gone further, and proposed that a “but for” test applies to reliance. This is not the place for full discussion, but a few points seem apposite by way of response. One is that a heightening of the bar for reliance seems not altogether easy to reconcile with earlier caselaw or with the mechanics of proof described in Museprime v Adhill (see below). Another is that contract analysis seems more accident-prone in this area than public law would be, not least because public law has learnt from unpicking formal statements of reasons provided by those who decide (and explain) pursuant to duty. The distinction between factors which are “important” to a decision, and others merely “supportive of it” could readily be ideated in public law with regard to weight. The last is that <span class="bd">McKendrick</span>&#8216;s references to Raifeissen seem to be just that – references, with little done to pursue coherence.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The requirement that a misrepresentation should be capable of affecting the mind of a reasonable person (as opposed to being wholly trivial, or totally irrelevant, or mere sales talk) seems to derive from contracts which include a duty of disclosure – typically, insurance contracts. Since any non-disclosure entitles the insurer to avoid the contract, there has to be some limit on what is required to be disclosed, and it is provided by materiality. Otherwise the way would be open to opportunistic and unjustified repudiations of liability by insurers. The class of facts to be disclosed is defined as any capable of affecting the mind of a reasonable insurer in deciding whether to take on the risk, and if so, on what terms. In <i>Pan Atlantic Co Ltd v Pine Top Insurance Co Ltd</i> [1994] 3 All ER 581, Lord Mustill and the majority of the House of Lords held that misrepresentation included a similar test.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Complexity arises because materiality seems not to be used as a simple test to be passed or failed by a given representation. Instead, it is suggested that where a representation is not material, the representee must assume the probative burden of showing that he did in fact rely on it in deciding to enter the contract. Where a representation is material, it is the representor who has the burden of showing that the other did not rely on it (see <i>Museprime Properties Ltd v Adhill Properties Ltd</i> (1991) 61 P &amp; CR 111).</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation there is no requirement of materiality. As Treitel puts it (paragraph 9-014) “a person who has successfully perpetrated a fraud cannot be heard to say that the representation which he used to achieve this end was immaterial”.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The shifting of the burden of proof described above is probably for the best, because in the majority of cases it will relieve the representee of the difficult task of demonstrating reliance (while it is only fair that he should have to do just that if the representation is not one on which most people would have relied). The cases on reliance tend either to articulate fairly obvious impediments to finding it, or to consider whether reliance must have been objectively reasonable in addition to being subjectively present. Each issue will be examined in turn.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In the class of obvious impediments are cases in which the representee did not become aware of the representation; or took no account of it; or realised that it was false.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

By far the greater part of this lecture is confined to misrepresentation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Its structure broadly follows that of the Misrepresentation Act 1967. This Act by no means deals comprehensively with the relevant law – far from it, in fact – but its coverage does have a certain logic which can be adopted for a general exposition of the subject. This is an unorthodox means of organising the material, but it works, and it seems preferable to a presentation in which the sections of the Act are shuffled and dispersed into a discussion focused on the common law.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Rescission, the basic remedy for misrepresentation, is easy enough to understand in principle, but both the Act and the common law place restrictions upon its availability. These are examined in turn. A great many authorities could be cited on the common law “bars to rescission”, but it has seemed more realistic to explain this subject as a collection of principles without multiplying the quantity of cases needing to be learnt.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The last substantive section of the Act makes attempts to exclude liability for misrepresentation subject to one of the reasonableness tests in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. This provides a suitable opportunity to look more generally at the topic of exemption in this area, which is potentially fairly confusing.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Act begins by relaxing the boundary between intra-contractual terms and extra-contractual representations, and that seems as good a starting point as any.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Questions relating to the quantification of damages for misrepresentation are among the most difficult in general contract law.

This reflected the fact that prior to the passing of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 there were no damages for misrepresentation unless it was fraudulent. The standard remedy for misrepresentation was rescission, which means the retroactive dismantling of the contract, and involves the return of its subject matter and the repayment of the price.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It followed that a claimant who wanted compensation for having been deprived of a good bargain would not get it, save by showing that the false pre-contractual statement had become a term of the contract. Meanwhile, rescission itself might be unavailable for misrepresentation, since there were and are formal bars to rescission (eg. the impossibility of giving back the subject matter of the contract). These will be discussed in due course.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Despite the above, it was not invariably most advantageous to prove that a representation had become a term of the contract. After all, if the contract had turned out to be a bad bargain, an action for breach of contract might result in only nominal damages. By contrast a misrepresentation action, if it lay, was likely to produce the remedy of rescission and thereby rescue the claimant from the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Until the passing of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the weight of authority was against the permissibility of treating a term as a representation. Section 1 of the Act removes any common law impediment to doing that. It does appear necessary, nevertheless, that the term should have featured in pre-contractual exchanges as a representation independently of its later incorporation into the contract. If it first appears in the contract itself, then it must continue to be treated as a term; it is nothing else.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Even this relatively simple and self-contained proposition, beyond serving as an explanation of section 1 of the Act, involves an anomaly. If it is possible to bring a misrepresentation action and seek rescission for the falsity of a statement which later became a warranty (not a condition) of the contract, the claimant seems to be able to find a way out of the contract even though no such escape lies for mere breach of warranty. Breach of warranty is compensated only by damages, not by termination. By effectively downgrading a warranty to a representation, the claimant seems to be able to assert a superior remedy.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In fact the Act includes a means of stopping this from happening, since by section 2(2) it gives a court the discretion to refuse rescission for any non-fraudulent misrepresentation where that remedy would be inappropriate. This will be examined in due course.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It can be described, with an approach to accuracy, as “negligent misrepresentation”; the minor shortcoming of that label will be seen shortly, and of course negligent misrepresentation is always to be distinguished rigorously from negligent misstatement at common law. Since section 2(1) creates this new form of liability by a means which involves reference to fraudulent misrepresentation, and it also enacts a defence which will downgrade negligent to innocent misrepresentation if it is made out by the defendant, a grasp of section 2(1) therefore requires all three types of misrepresentation to have been understood. They will be presented here in turn.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This is a sub-category of the broader tort of deceit. Deceit covers any use of fraud which causes loss to the person deceived. Fraudulent misrepresentation is present where the innocent party has entered into a contract with the fraudster. The remedies for fraudulent misrepresentation are rescission and/or damages.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The first case to be cited concerns the state of mind required for a defendant to be found fraudulent. It is worth being aware from the outset that fraud must be strictly proved, so that if there is any doubt whether that can be done on given facts it would be prudent to choose a different cause of action.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It goes on to provide that such a person will be so liable even though the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently. It then enacts a partial defence to such liability for the defendant who can show that he had good grounds to believe and did believe at all material times that the facts represented by him were true.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This oddly drafted provision, based on what has become known as “the fiction of fraud”, creates a new misrepresentation action not previously known to the law. Clearly it is not fraudulent misrepresentation. Nor is it innocent misrepresentation since to show that the misrepresentation was innocent amounts to a defence to this new form of liability, even though liability for innocent misrepresentation will of course remain. What is left is misrepresentation accompanied by an intermediate level of culpability, short of fraud but beyond innocence. It is usual to describe this as “negligent misrepresentation”, though it can also be referred to as “statutory” or “section 2(1)” misrepresentation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A potential if minor misunderstanding should be avoided before we take the subject any further. While it is accurate to say that negligent misrepresentation is a new action not known to the law before the passing of the 1967 Act, it would be wrong to conclude that a misrepresentation which was in fact negligently made could not be the subject of an action before 1967. It would have been regarded as an action for innocent misrepresentation, in so far as it fell short of an allegation of fraud. Alternatively, it might have been brought (and may still be brought) as an action for negligent misstatement following <i>Hedley Byrne</i>, provided the pre-conditions for that form of liability could be established – special relationship/assumption of responsibility.<br>&emsp;&emsp;To return to section 2(1) of the 1967 Act, it presents two very notable aspects.<br>&emsp;&emsp;One is that in introducing the special category of sub-fraudulent culpability, it does so by transferring the burden of <i>disproving</i> that fault to the defendant. This is quite remarkable. To assess it within the parameters of the situation pertaining prior to the Act, fraud was to be strictly proved by the plaintiff, while in the case of innocent misrepresentation there is obviously no degree of fault to be proved. The <i>Hedley Byrne</i> action, if it may be viewed as a model, places the proof of negligence where one would expect it – upon the plaintiff. The Act, in creating negligent misrepresentation, removes what might be regarded as the natural burden of proof from the plaintiff, and places it in the form of a burden of disproof upon the defendant.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The second remarkable aspect of section 2(1) is that it seems to transfer the “liability” for fraud, and therefore its remedies, to the new cause of action. The quantum of damages for fraudulent misrepresentation is far-reaching for policy reasons which can readily be articulated, but it is surprising that an honest misrepresentor should be liable to the same degree. Nevertheless, that has been taken to be the effect of the words “shall be so liable” in section 2(1). They establish that just as the remedies for fraudulent misrepresentation are rescission and/or damages with no test of foreseeability, so the same is true of negligent misrepresentation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The next two cases provide confirmatory authority for these two aspects of section 2(1).</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Rescission is not available for negligent misstatement at common law; bear in mind that there may well be nothing to rescind through that action, since it does not require the claimant to have entered into a contract with the defendant. Even if there is a contract, it cannot be rescinded for negligent misstatement. The sole remedy obtained through that action is damages in the tort of negligence.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Rescission is a drastic remedy, since it undoes the contract and restores the parties to the position in which they would have been had they not entered it. The rationale for this is that the making of the contract was consequent upon a wrong.<br>&emsp;&emsp;That is not to say that the contract itself is tainted so that it must necessarily be rescinded. It is voidable. This means that the claimant has the option of rescinding or “avoiding” the contract, subject to any statutory or common law impediments to rescission. The claimant cannot be obliged to rescind the contract, however.<br>&emsp;&emsp;For fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation, where the court has power to make an award of damages, the claimant may seek rescission alone, or damages alone, or rescission and damages. If rescission and damages are granted, then the fact of rescinding the contract is likely to reduce the quantum of damages which can properly be recovered. After all, certain losses will cease to accumulate from the time that the contract is rescinded.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Rescission may be achieved informally, without the court&#8217;s involvement, or it may take place by order of the court. The following case gives guidance on what will be deemed to amount to rescission, informally exercised.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

For the purposes of this year, the aim is to know what the bars to rescission are in principle. If the need to research any of them further should arise, all the full-length textbooks refer to authorities from which a more detailed understanding can be developed.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Since misrepresentation renders a contract voidable, the representee must choose whether to use this remedy or not once he has become aware of the facts justifying rescission. The situation resembles the election to be made upon breach of condition (whether to terminate the contract or not). Here, as there, the election once made is binding.<br>&emsp;&emsp;There is some doubt whether lapse of time after discovery of the truth and before a purported rescission is a bar to rescission in its own right, or merely evidence from which affirmation can be deduced. Furthermore, a distinction is to be drawn between cases of fraudulent and non-fraudulent misrepresentation. In the first case, time runs from discovery of the fraud. In the second case, time appears to run from the date of the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Since rescission is not an automatic consequence of misrepresentation, but is at the option of the representee, it may be defeated by the claim to security of another&#8217;s subsequent transaction involving the property. Where a third party has acquired a bona fide claim to the property for value, that prevents rescission. This will be so notwithstanding that the original contract was induced by fraudulent misrepresentation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;For rescission to be available, it must be possible to give back what passed under the contract. If, for example, goods have been consumed or much altered after delivery to the representee, they cannot be returned. If only minor alteration has taken place, the court in its equitable jurisdiction may order a monetary adjustment to be made in order to achieve the equivalent of full restitution in the changed circumstances.<br>&emsp;&emsp;3 Avoidance of provision excluding liability for misrepresentation.<b>E+W</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;(a) any liability to which a party to a contract may be subject by reason of any misrepresentation made by him before the contract was made; or<br>&emsp;&emsp;(b) any remedy available to another party to the contract by reason of such a misrepresentation,<br>&emsp;&emsp;that term shall be of no effect except in so far as it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness as stated in section 11(1) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977; and it is for those claiming that the term satisfies that requirement to show that it does.<br>&emsp;&emsp;2) This section does not apply to a term in a consumer contract within the meaning of Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (but see the provision made about such contracts in section 62 of that Act).<br>&emsp;&emsp;In its final substantive section the 1967 Act returns to a standard style of drafting, and the effect of section 3 is fairly clear. A contractual clause exempting or restricting liability for pre-contractual misrepresentation is subject to the reasonableness test in section 11(1) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (that is the sub-section which deals with the reasonableness of contractual terms), or the equivalent in the 2015 Act in the case of a consumer contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Section 3 is deemed to apply only to liability for negligent or innocent misrepresentation. In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation, the common law has taken the position on public policy grounds that the exclusion of liability is ineffective (see <i>S. Pearson &amp; Son Ltd v Dublin Corporation</i> (1907)). The position with regard to attempts to exclude liability for the fraud of agents is less clear, but will not be considered further here.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The main issue which has arisen as a result of section 3 concerns clauses which could arguably be said to exclude or restrict liability, or which could alternatively be argued to prevent liability for misrepresentation arising in the first place.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The debate repeats the difference of approach which can be taken to ordinary exemption clauses providing a defence against actions for breach of contract (or, as some would have it, preventing breach from occurring in the first place in so far as they restrict the primary obligations undertaken pursuant to the contract). It is worth recalling the line taken here earlier in that regard. The mainstream attitude to such clauses is that they should be construed as potential defences. To regard them as restricting contractual obligations ab initio is to risk depriving the 1977 Act of the protective effect which Parliament meant it to have.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the case of misrepresentation, however, these arguments may be more finely balanced. Representations may be made in the course of pre-contractual negotiations not only by the principal, but also by the principal&#8217;s agent or agents. The sources of potential liability for misrepresentation are somewhat broader than those of potential contractual liability. Protective drafting to restrict them may well be more readily defensible.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-233'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Misrepresentation (2)</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Beyond section 3</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Section 3 clearly applies only to exclusions of liability for misrepresentation which have been incorporated into the contract between the parties. It is natural and proper to wonder about the effect, if any, of exemptions which have not been incorporated. Unhelpfully, the textbooks ignore the issue.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the case of exemptions from liability for breach, there would be no issue to be examined unless they were validly incorporated. Liability for breach arises from the contract and can only be negatived by the contract, or by some other document which is to be construed with the contract. Liability for misrepresentation does not arise from the contract. Therefore it would seem doubtful to assert that it can only be modified or exempted by a contractual term.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If a party makes a representation, but accompanies it with a warning that the other must not rely on it, it is hard to see why the law should refuse to allow that warning any effect. If it is thought that <i>Cremdean v Nash</i> gives grounds for asserting precisely that, then it will be necessary to reconcile that case with the attitude of the law in negligent misstatement. <i>Hedley Byrne</i> and <i>McCullagh v Lane Fox</i> both recognise that an express disclaimer does have legal effect in so far as it is likely to negative any assumption of responsibility. It is taken at face value.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Misrepresentation is conditioned upon both materiality and reliance. If a representation is made, but accompanied by a non-contractual warning that it should not affect the mind of the representee, why should it not be given effect?<br>&emsp;&emsp;If the representation is negligent, then the non-contractual warning can be dealt with by section 2(2) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, which makes the exclusion or restriction of liability for negligence by a contract term <i>or by a notice</i> subject to a reasonableness test. The fears expressed in <i>Cremdean v Nash</i> would therefore have no application here.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If the representation is innocent, then the 1977 Act does not provide a means of controlling the effect of a non-contractual warning about it. It would be for the common law, in a proper case, to follow its own logic by accepting that such a warning could undermine the materiality of a representation. If that threatened injustice, the relevant caselaw is flexible enough to allow positive proof of reliance despite the reduction in materiality.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It may be helpful to sum up the crucial points on exclusions as concisely as possible, since the foregoing discussion has been an involved one:<br>&emsp;&emsp;Fraudulent misrepresentation: principal&#8217;s liability for fraud cannot be excluded.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Non-fraudulent misrepresentation: exclusion must be reasonable (section 3 MRA).<br>&emsp;&emsp;Negligent misstatement: disclaimer of responsibility may prevent a duty of care arising.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Non-fraudulent misrepresentation: exclusion of negligence liability may be subject to section 2(2) UCTA; exclusion of non-negligent liability may go to materiality of representation.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Its reputation is partially justified. One aspect of its difficulty is that there is no unified doctrine of mistake. The area is dealt with by principles derived largely from elsewhere, and they differ according to the type of mistake in question. A second cause of difficulty is the law&#8217;s reliance on two or three distinctions which have proven hard to apply consistently to facts.<br>&emsp;&emsp;However, while the difficulties are real, they are not so formidable as to rule out a concise introductory account of the subject.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where mistake has left the parties at cross purposes, it negatives agreement (this is “<b>mutual mistake</b>”). One thought he offered peas; the other thought he accepted beans. Unless there is an objective means of ascertaining what the subject matter of the contract was meant to be, the contract is void.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where one party mistakenly deals with an interloper rather than his intended contractual partner, agreement is again negatived (this is “<b>unilateral mistake</b>”). It was X who was offered peas, but Y purported to accept that offer, masquerading as X. The contract may be void or it may be merely voidable, depending on some rather fine distinctions.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where the parties have dealt on the basis of a fundamental misapprehension as to the subject matter of their contract, consent is nullified (this is “<b>common mistake</b>”). They thought they were dealing in peas, but in fact the peas turned out to be beans. The contract is void, because the parties had no intention to contract as in fact they did.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In unilateral mistake, the one party&#8217;s misapprehension will often be found to be not a matter of the other&#8217;s identity as such, but rather of some attribute which the other represented himself to have (eg. the honest intention to pay). In that case, the contract will not be void; it will be voidable for fraudulent misrepresentation. This area has proved to be highly problematic.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In common mistake, there has been much discussion of how fundamental the parties&#8217; shared misapprehension must be in order to justify avoidance of the contract. An equitable easing of the situation by Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> lasted 50 years, but has fairly recently been declared bad law.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Properly it denotes the situation in which the parties misunderstand each other, so that they are at cross-purposes. It is sometimes said that two mistakes are therefore being made, one by each party.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The real questions where the parties are at cross-purposes are (a) whether this misunderstanding amounts to a flaw in their contract, or is nothing more than private misapprehension; (b) whether it matters that one party may be more to blame for the misunderstanding than the other; and (c) whether the matrix of fact allows a court to identify the more probable understanding, and therefore to overcome the ambiguity.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If the ambiguity does attach to the terms of the agreement and cannot be overcome, then the contract is void. This can be put in terms of a mismatch of offer and acceptance or, if it fits the facts better, in terms of vagueness rendering the contract unenforceable.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The first in the short line of cases debating the predicament lacks a reasoned judgment and is therefore of somewhat limited value.

They have led the law into the attempt to draw a distinction which some regard as impossible to maintain. It is worth taking a few moments to set it out in principled terms.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In all these cases, on any view, fraudulent misrepresentation is present, so that the misrepresentee would be entitled in principle to rescind the contract into which he has been fraudulently induced to enter. The problem is that this remedy may be worth little or nothing in the circumstances. Rescission involves recovering the purchase price from the defendant; if the defendant is a fraudster he may have absconded or be penniless. Furthermore, the fraudster may have passed the property to a third party who buys without awareness of the fraud. If the contract with the fraudster can be rescinded <b>before</b> the property passes to the third party, then that person obtains no rights to it (since the fraudster had none left to give following rescission). The misrepresentee recovers it from the innocent third party by an action in the tort of conversion. If, however, rescission is attempted only <b>after </b>the third party has obtained the property, the third party is invulnerable to an action by the misrepresentee. Rescission is blocked by the common law bar of third party rights, as seen in the last lecture.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In this latter instance, the misrepresentee has only one recourse. He may attempt to persuade the court not that the contract was voidable for fraudulent misrepresentation, but that it never came into being at all. It was void because the misrepresentee never intended to contract with the fraudster, but only with the person whose identity the fraudster assumed. On this view there is a mismatch of offer and acceptance. The contract is indeed void.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The difficulty with the argument is this. While the defrauded misrepresentee may sincerely protest that he never meant to contract with a fraudster, the objective view taken by the law suggests that he did precisely that. The misrepresentee will have to show that the fraudster was a mere mechanism by which he contracted (as he mistakenly believed) with “X”. This will be met by the argument (almost certainly put forward by the third party) that the fraudster&#8217;s assumption of the identity of “X” was simply the means by which he persuaded the misrepresentee that he would honestly pay, rather than defaulting. The drawing of the line between these competing interpretations has proved troublesome.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The next case is authority for the principle that English law maintains a distinction for the present purpose between contracts entered into at a distance (eg. through correspondence), and those entered into face to face (<i>inter praesentes</i>). With regard to the first class, the parties to the contract will be identified by construing the contract, quite possibly without regard to parol evidence. With regard to the second class, the courts strongly apply a presumption that the misrepresentee legally intended to contract with the person physically present. However, that presumption is not irrebuttable.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-245'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Mistake</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Common Mistake</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;“Common mistake” is not a well chosen label for this area of the law. It instantly requires a gloss. The label is used to denote cases in which the parties do not misunderstand each other, nor is one misled by the other. They contract on a basis which proves to have been fallacious, because they share a mistaken assumption about some basic aspect of the contract&#8217;s subject matter.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Two sub-categories of common mistake are covered by long-standing rules. These are the cases (a) of <i>res extincta</i> (agreeing to deal in something which in fact has no existence); and (b) <i>res sua</i> (agreeing to deal in something which transpires already to belong to the party which is to acquire it). In these cases, the contract will be void. This makes sense, because performance of such agreements is in fact impossible.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Other shared mistakes as to the subject matter of the contract may make it void even though it is not literally impossible of performance, provided the mistake is of a wholly fundamental character. This in itself is a slightly puzzling idea if one pauses to give it thought; why should such contracts be void? It is said that mistakes of this sort do not <i>negative</i> agreement, but <i>nullify consent</i>. This means that there is no disruption on the level of contract formation of the type which explains the outcome in cases of true mutual mistake or unilateral mistake where offer and acceptance fail to match. Agreement is present, but the law applies a rule to cancel its effect because of the parties&#8217; mistake. The contract is void. One explanation of this outcome is that the parties lacked the necessary contractual intention to make the agreement which in form they made.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The main themes within this area are (a) the gravity of the mistake which must be shown for the contract to be void; and (b) the discovery by Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> of an equitable jurisdiction to rescind contracts for somewhat less grave mistakes – before that jurisdiction was declared by the Court of Appeal to be illusory.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

This principle is codifed by section 6 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the goods without the knowledge of the seller have perished at the time when the contract is made, the contract is void”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This principle found its way into the Sale of Goods Act from the difficult mid-nineteenth century case of <i>Couturier v Hastie</i> (1856). Here, one party agreed to sell and the other to buy a cargo of corn, both unaware that at the date of the contract the corn had deteriorated and had already been sold in Tunis. The seller argued that the buyer had acquired all the risks associated with the sale, and should pay the contract price upon receipt of the shipping documents. The court held that the buyer was not liable since the contract supposed there to be something in existence which was capable of being sold/bought, when in fact there was not.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Does it follow from this case that when parties share a mistaken belief in the existence of the contract&#8217;s subject matter the contract will be void? The following very well-known Australian case shows that it cannot be that simple.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Courts have found contracts to be void for common mistake where, for instance, land was to be cropped or mined at rates which have subsequently proved to have been impossible from the outset: see <i>Sheikh Brothers Ltd v Ochsner</i> (1957), and <i>Clifford (Lord) v Watts</i> (1870). These cases are analogous to the <i>res extincta</i> and <i>res sua</i> situations.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As for common mistakes which do not render performance impossible, the sufficient gravity has occasionally been found when the subject-matter of the contract is a legal obligation rather than a thing.

If a contract is frustrated, then in a sense it has failed. Most contracts do not fail. If circumstances change during their performance, contracts will very often be found adequately to have allocated the risk of the consequences to one or the other party.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The effect of frustration is to terminate a contract which was capable of performance at the time it was made, but has since been overtaken by the impossibility, or the effective impossibility, of performance.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Frustration therefore resembles the last topic, common mistake. The difference is that common mistake is operative at the time the contract is concluded, whereas frustration occurs later, before or during the period for performance.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The comparison between common mistake and frustration is of some further value. The peculiarity of common mistake is that only a mistake so fundamental as to be somewhat difficult of definition will render the contract void (see <i>Bell v Lever Brothers</i>). This is mirrored by the reluctance of courts to find frustration in most circumstances.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Various reasons for this reluctance are worth noting. The first is that contractual liability is normally strict; the failure to perform a contract is a breach for which damages must be paid, irrespective of an absence of fault. Frustration can be seen as an anomalous deviation from this principle (and as the first case shows, the law once applied the principle itself). A second reason is that frustration has historically been a singularly blunt instrument, enabling one party to walk away from a loss which is borne in its entirety by the other. This situation has been mitigated by the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A third reason is that from one perspective frustration could be judged theoretically impossible. In a sense, each and every contract pre-allocates every conceivable risk. In so far as it is silent about where the risk is placed, it can be seen to be impliedly providing that the loss should lie where in fact it falls. If the parties had wished otherwise, no doubt they would have agreed a provision to alter the default outcome. Where a risk has been foreseen by the parties even though it has not been expressly allocated, this view is thought by most (but not Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span>) to be all but inescapable.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Given these impediments to a doctrine of frustration, it is quite surprising that the doctrine exists. Nevertheless it does, and it occasionally assumes considerable importance when numerous commercial contracts are gravely disrupted by war (and in particular by the closure of international waterways). The cases which result from such events show how closely English courts and arbitrators will adapt the law to the realities of commercial activity.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Its subject matter may be destroyed (as in <i>Taylor v Caldwell</i>); the party who is to render the contractual performance may die or become incapacitated; performance of the contract may be rendered illegal (for example where it would amount to trading with the enemy in wartime).<br>&emsp;&emsp;However, these situations can easily shade into others in which similar difficulties do not literally rule out performance, but rather make it more difficult. The fact that the contract has become more inconvenient or expensive or even very much more expensive for one party to perform does not normally amount to its frustration. Rather, it has become a bad bargain, though still a valid one. The policy of the law obviously is to uphold bargains irrespective of whether they are good or bad.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

These cases will be the main focus of the central part of this lecture.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The problem here is akin to the one which centres on Lord <span class="bd">Atkin</span>&#8216;s example in <i>Bell v Lever Brothers</i> of the painting believed to be by an old master, in fact valueless but a painting nonetheless. Is an equally reductive or unilateral a view taken of what the subject matter or purpose of the contract actually was? Changed circumstances are not likely to affect both parties equally, since one may very well have a relatively active and the other a relatively passive role within the contract. How far may the passive one maintain that his interest (eg. to continue to receive hire for a vessel) is unaffected by the change, even though the other protests that his commercial adventure has been altered out of all recognition and its purpose destroyed?</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Frustration releases contracting parties from their obligations; on any view this is an exceptional and rarely granted release, and where it is claimed by a party who is to blame for the supervening event, the plea fails as a matter of policy. The same tends to be true where non-performance is not due to fault but to a commercial decision about which of several incompatible contracts to abandon.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Questions have arisen over issues including (a) what counts as responsibility for the event which puts it out of one party&#8217;s power to perform; and (b) the degree of responsibility which the law will regard as rendering frustration unavailable.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Lauritzen AS v Wijsmuller BV, The Super Servant Two [1990] 1 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep 1</span></span></p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;A drilling rig had been built in Japan for the plaintiffs. They contracted with the defendants to transport it to Rotterdam. The defendants had two vessels capable of carrying out this contract – the <i>Super Servant One</i> and the <i>Super Servant Two</i>. The defendants decided to use the <i>Super Servant Two</i> for the contract, and the other vessel was booked for other contracts. Some months before the time for performance, the <i>Super Servant Two</i> was lost in the Zaire River. The defendants informed the plaintiffs that they were not able to carry out the contract, and the plaintiffs sued for the additional cost of transporting the drilling rig by a different contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that the contract between the parties was not frustrated. If the contract had specifically provided for the <i>Super Servant Two</i> to be used, then it would have been frustrated by the sinking of that vessel. The contract had left the choice of vessel to the defendant. It was the defendant&#8217;s decision to allocate the <i>Super Servant One</i> to other contracts which put it out of its power to perform. It even appeared that the defendant had entered into some of these contracts after the other vessel sank.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The argument for Wijsmuller, the defendant, was that the sinking of the <i>Super Servant Two</i> and its inability to perform the present contract formed a single succession of events not interrupted by its decision to allocate the <i>Super Servant One</i> elsewhere. This was based on the submission that its decision was a reasonable one in the circumstances, and therefore did not break a chain of causation beginning with the loss of the <i>Super Servant Two</i> and ending with the abandonment of the contract with the plaintiffs. On this view the sinking had automatically rendered the performance of at least one of Wijsmuller&#8217;s contracts impossible. Wijsmuller placed reliance on Professor <span class="bd">Treitel</span>&#8216;s opinion that a force majeure clause would not be deprived of effect simply because the party seeking its protection acted reasonably in deciding which of its obligations it would honour and which abandon.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal&#8217;s response was to draw a distinction between consensual force majeure clauses and claims of frustration (the first arising from agreement, and the second from independent operation of law). The court regarded itself as bound by the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Maritime National Fish Ltd v Ocean Trawlers Ltd</i> [1935] AC 524 to hold that the interposition of human choice ousted frustration.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Unsurprisingly this is a case on which Professor Treitel has strong views. He argues that Maritime National Fish was distinguishable, because there it would have been possible for the party claiming frustration to perform all his contracts, though at some disadvantage to his own interests. In the Super Servant Two, a contract was inevitably going to be unperformable. Treitel states his dislike of the rule that frustration, if it occurs at all, occurs automatically. He correctly points out that it is not applied in all cases, and considers it to have been wrongly extended in the Super Servant Two. He counters the reasoning that the risk of having too many contracts to perform is properly allocated to the party who here claims frustration; the same risk exists where only one contract is undertaken, and to regard this as disapplying frustration would be to strike at the very root of the defence. The actual decision in the Super Servant Two may have been influenced by indications that Wijsmuller astutely protected its own self-interest through its actions after the vessel was lost. Professor Treitel&#8217;s answer to this is that a rule of law should apply to such situations; incompatible contracts should rank in the order in which they were entered, so that the first should be performed and the last deemed frustrated.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Where self-inducement of frustration is raised, it is for the party making that allegation to prove it, as the next case shows.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

If they meant otherwise, the contract would presumably say so.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In other words, it has normally been thought that the foresight or even foreseeability (deemed foresight) of an event prevents its occurrence from frustrating a contract. It justifies the inference that the parties have contracted with reference, as it were, to the event.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The principal spokesman for this view is Professor <span class="bd">Treitel</span>. He points out that there are many dicta which support it, but admits that there is no English case in which foresight was the sole ground for rejecting a plea of frustration (para 19-076). He goes on to qualify the principle, however, by requiring that the parties should have had actual foresight of the event, or that it should have been highly foreseeable, and foreseeable in some detail.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

If it is very great (“inordinate”), it clearly may produce frustration. Of course it is likely to be otherwise if it is comparatively short. Where one party asserts that the contract is frustrated and the other contests this, the nature of the interruption will almost certainly appear quite different by the time the case reaches trial from how it appeared to the parties at the time. One question is whether the law adopts the parties&#8217; contemporary assessment of the situation, or uses the benefit of hindsight. The answer is that the law is very closely aligned with the parties&#8217; contemporaneous perspective, as the following passage from the judgment of Lord Sumner in <i>Bank Line v Arthur Capel</i> shows.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

parties to frustrated contracts.<b>E+W+S+N.I.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1) Where a contract governed by English law has become impossible of performance or been otherwise frustrated, and the parties thereto have for that reason been discharged from the further performance of the contract, the following provisions of this section shall, subject to the provisions of section two of this Act, have effect in relation thereto.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) All sums paid or payable to any party in pursuance of the contract before the time when the parties were so discharged (in this Act referred to as “the time of discharge”) shall, in the case of sums so paid, be recoverable from him as money received by him for the use of the party by whom the sums were paid, and, in the case of sums so payable, cease to be so payable:<br>&emsp;&emsp;Provided that, if the party to whom the sums were so paid or payable incurred expenses before the time of discharge in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, the court may, if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case, allow him to retain or, as the case may be, recover the whole or any part of the sums so paid or payable, not being an amount in excess of the expenses so incurred.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) Where any party to the contract has, by reason of anything done by any other party thereto in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, obtained a valuable benefit (other than a payment of money to which the last foregoing subsection applies) before the time of discharge, there shall be recoverable from him by the said other party such sum (if any), not exceeding the value of the said benefit to the party obtaining it, as the court considers just, having regard to all the circumstances of the case and, in particular,—<br>&emsp;&emsp;(a) the amount of any expenses incurred before the time of discharge by the benefited party in, or for the purpose of, the performance of the contract, including any sums paid or payable by him to any other party in pursuance of the contract and retained or recoverable by that party under the last foregoing subsection, and<br>&emsp;&emsp;(b) the effect, in relation to the said benefit, of the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) In estimating, for the purposes of the foregoing provisions of this section, the amount of any expenses incurred by any party to the contract, the court may, without prejudice to the generality of the said provisions, include such sum as appears to be reasonable in respect of overhead expenses and in respect of any work or services performed personally by the said party.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(5) In considering whether any sum ought to be recovered or retained under the foregoing provisions of this section by any party to the contract, the court shall not take into account any sums which have, by reason of the circumstances giving rise to the frustration of the contract, become payable to that party under any contract of insurance unless there was an obligation to insure imposed by an express term of the frustrated contract or by or under any enactment.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(6) Where any person has assumed obligations under the contract in consideration of the conferring of a benefit by any other party to the contract upon any other person, whether a party to the contract or not, the court may, if in all the circumstances of the case it considers it just to do so, treat for the purposes of subsection (3) of this section any benefit so conferred as a benefit obtained by the person who has assumed the obligations as aforesaid.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1) This Act shall apply to contracts, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, as respects which the time of discharge is on or after the first day of July, nineteen hundred and forty-three, but not to contracts as respects which the time of discharge is before the said date.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) This Act shall apply to contracts to which the Crown is a party in like manner as to contracts between subjects.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) Where any contract to which this Act applies contains any provision which, upon the true construction of the contract, is intended to have effect in the event of circumstances arising which operate, or would but for the said provision operate, to frustrate the contract, or is intended to have effect whether such circumstances arise or not, the court shall give effect to the said provision and shall only give effect to the foregoing section of this Act to such extent, if any, as appears to the court to be consistent with the said provision.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4)Where it appears to the court that a part of any contract to which this Act applies can properly be severed from the remainder of the contract, being a part wholly performed before the time of discharge, or so performed except for the payment in respect of that part of the contract of sums which are or can be ascertained under the contract, the court shall treat that part of the contract as if it were a separate contract and had not been frustrated and shall treat the foregoing section of this Act as only applicable to the remainder of that contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(a) to any charterparty, except a time charterparty or a charterparty by way of demise, or to any contract (other than a charterparty) for the carriage of goods by sea; or<br>&emsp;&emsp;(b) to any contract of insurance, save as is provided by subsection (5) of the foregoing section; or<br>&emsp;&emsp;(c) to any contract to which section 7 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979(which avoids contracts for the sale of specific goods which perish before the risk has passed to the buyer) applies, or to any other contract for the sale, or for the sale and delivery, of specific goods, where the contract is frustrated by reason of the fact that the goods have perished.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Annotations are used to give authority for changes and other effects on the legislation you are viewing and to convey editorial information.

Those of specific performance and injunction arise from the court&#8217;s equitable discretion, and not from any mechanism triggered by breach. For that reason they will not be further considered in this lecture. The remedies of termination and damages do derive from the contract which has been breached.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The basic position has already been set out in lecture 11. Termination of the contract is available for breach of any of its terms which the parties have agreed (and the court confirms) to be conditions, or for breaches which deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit of his bargain (the innominate term analysis). Damages, however, are available for breach of any contractual terms, including less important ones (warranties).<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where the right to terminate exists, the innocent party may elect to forego it, suing only for damages. For breach of warranty, the innocent party is entitled only to damages.<br>&emsp;&emsp;One may wonder by what reasoning a contract, which may well have nothing to say about termination or payment of damages, affords these rights when breached. This is given a principled explanation by Lord <span class="bd">Diplock</span> in a case already cited in lecture 12. In <i>Photo Productions v Securicor</i> the House of Lords swept away Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span>&#8216;s doctrine of fundamental breach, which had been based on the notion that such a breach disapplies the contract in all its aspects. The true position is that the contract continues to govern in the matter of remedies, at least by implication of the common law.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

On one view this cannot accurately be described as a breach of the contract, since no obligation to perform has yet arisen. However, the common law has adopted the position that an anticipatory breach gives rise immediately to rights for the innocent party. This can be explained on the basis, approved in the next case, that the breach is of an implied contract that neither party will do anything inconsistent with the substantive contract in the time between entry into it and performance.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The rights arising on anticipatory breach are to elect to treat the contract as repudiated and sue for damages forthwith, or to disregard the repudiation. It should be noted that if the latter course is adopted, and the other party does in fact perform, there will be no remedy for the earlier indication that he was not going to do so.<br>&emsp;&emsp;An anticipatory breach only occurs where the threshold for repudiation is reached (see above). It must be apparent that the breach would deprive the innocent party of effectively his entire bargain.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-288'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Breach of Contract</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Entire and severable obligations</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This topic is linked to the preceding one in the following way. The question whether a breach of contract is such as to deprive the innocent party of substantially their entire bargain depends not only on the magnitude of the breach, but also upon the purpose and structure of the contract. In some instances it will easily be shown that a given breach leaves little or nothing of value for the other party (for example, wholly defective goods are delivered). Statute confirms the traditional view of the common law that in this situation the contact may be terminated.<br>&emsp;&emsp;However, if the contract is for the delivery of several consignments of goods, and one such consignment proves wholly defective, it is not so obvious that this would justify termination of the overall contract. No doubt the affected consignment could be rejected, but a common sense view of the breach in the context of the broader relationship between the parties tends to confine its impact to one part of the contract. The rest is not affected.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This shift in perspective is particularly significant where the contract specifies a sum of money to be paid by one party in return for the other&#8217;s performance. If that performance is regarded as entire, then the innocent party may withhold his own performance (the making of payment). If the contract is divisible, payment must be made, though it may be reduced to take account of the other&#8217;s default.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The next case is a well-known example of an “entire” contract, and the injustice to which that analysis is capable of leading.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Where performance of an entire contract has been left incomplete, the contract price cannot be claimed, but it may be possible to imply a fresh contract. Into this implied contract there can be implied in turn a “quantum meruit”; in other words a promise to pay a reasonable sum for a benefit conferred.<br>&emsp;&emsp;For this device to work, it will be necessary for the party in default to show that the other exercised a free choice to take the benefit of as much work as the first had done, by building on it in some sense and thereby adopting it. The partial performance of the contract is regarded as the offer of a fresh contract, and the other&#8217;s adoption of it is regarded as an acceptance.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The principle is normally derived from the judgment of Lord Mansfield in <i>Boone v Eyre</i> (1779).<br>&emsp;&emsp;This seems to be an application of the distinction between conditions and warranties. If the contract breaker&#8217;s default amounts to breach of condition, then in not paying any part of the contract price the other is merely asserting his right to withhold further performance of his own contractual duties, and specifically, the obligation he would otherwise have to pay the contract price. If the default amounts only to a breach of warranty, then substantial performance has been rendered. The innocent party is not free to elect termination of the contract, and must therefore pay the contract price less the amount by which he can show the value of the performance to have been reduced by reason of the breach.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If the matter comes to litigation, then the innocent party will seek to raise the breach of warranty by way of set-off to the price claimed by the other.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Where performance is in fact possible, notwithstanding the fact that the other no longer wants it, is it possible to insist on providing it in order to claim the agreed price for it?<br>&emsp;&emsp;In certain circumstances it is. This answer derives from basic contractual principle, but has caused a degree of consternation.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

On fundamental principles of consideration the court cannot concern itself with the question of whether the relationship between performance and price represents a bad or an extravagantly good bargain for either party. This is a matter of freedom of contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;However, the contract may prescribe a sum to be paid, not upon completed performance, but upon breach. Here, it has traditionally been thought that the court may take a close and a comparatively paternalistic interest in the parties&#8217; deal.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If a sum made payable in these circumstances is nothing more than a pre-agreed estimate of the damage likely to be caused by the breach, then there is no objection. This feature of a contract is known as “liquidated damages”. If, however, it appears that the agreed sum is so disproportionate to the innocent party&#8217;s actual loss that it must have been included in the contract “<i>in terrorem</i>” of the other (to “terrify” the other into not committing a breach) then it is a penalty. The policy of the law is to disallow penalty clauses.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The contract provided that the tyres were not to be resold at less than a stipulated price, and stated that for every tyre sold in breach of this requirement the dealer would pay Dunlop £5 (a substantial sum at the time) “by way of liquidated damages and not as a penalty”. When breaches of this agreement were discovered, Dunlop brought an action for liquidated damages. It was allowed by the trial judge, but his decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the payment clause was a penalty.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords reversed the Court of Appeal&#8217;s decision. The £5 payment was a genuine pre-estimate of loss. It was necessary to bear in mind the extent of the harm which Dunlop would be likely to suffer from under-cutting. The agreement of an admittedly large sum by way of compensation was not unreasonable, given the further fact that actual loss of this extended type would be difficult to quantify.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Dunedin gave guidelines for distinguishing between penalties and genuine pre-estimates of loss, which have since become very well known. They are paraphrased here.<br>&emsp;&emsp;1. The sum payable is a penalty if it is extravagantly large in comparison with the greatest loss which the breach could possibly cause.<br>&emsp;&emsp;2. The sum is a penalty if the breach consists in failing to pay money, and the forfeit is larger than the amount which was to be paid.<br>&emsp;&emsp;3. If the sum is made payable on only one specified breach (rather than many), there is a presumption that it represents a genuine pre-estimate of loss.<br>&emsp;&emsp;4. If the sum is made payable for a range of breaches, there is a presumption that it is a penalty.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As seen in <i>Dunlop</i> itself, the guidance above will not prevent a court from taking a lenient view of a payment clause if it is apparent that actual loss would be difficult to assess.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It remains to be pointed out that the burden of proof lies on the party from whom payment is demanded to show that the obligation should be disallowed as a penalty. This is reasonable, since the clause has been the subject of agreement. However, the parties&#8217; description of the clause will be taken into account by the court. If it is described as a pre-estimate of loss, it will be presumed to be so. If (somewhat naively) it has been described as a penalty, the burden shifts to one of disproof.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A recent Supreme Court case, decided exactly 100 years after <i>Dunlop</i>, has examined the question of penalty clauses in detail. The account below gives no more than an introduction to it.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The subject of remedies is extensive, and cannot be treated in detail within the confines of the GDL.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The first section, on damages, is limited to the presentation of basic principles together with some supporting cases. The cases, given as bare citations, are provided only as signposts to lines of authority, and may be useful in the future. There is no expectation, at this stage of the year, that you will read and learn them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The second section of the lecture deals with the rules on “remoteness of loss”, or “consequential loss”. They apply to distinguish between those of the claimant&#8217;s losses for which the defendant must compensate in damages, and those for which compensation is not payable even though they were caused by the defendant&#8217;s breach of contract. They cannot simply be set out but need to be taught, and that is the approach which has been taken here.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Recovery for certain types of loss is barred primarily to facilitate contracting. Bishop, Beale &amp; Furmston posit the case of the taxi-driver booked to take Furmston to New York the following morning to negotiate a multi-million dollar deal. The taxi-driver oversleeps, so that Furmston misses his plane – and the deal. The taxi-driver cannot reasonably be made to stand the loss. If taxis are to be available for hire, and at reasonable prices, there has to be a rule that prevents that activity leading to inordinate liability.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The central issue within the area has been the test for remoteness, and whether there is a valid distinction between the rule as it operates in tort and within contract. The matter is not fully resolved.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The last two sections of the lecture address specific performance and restitution. They consist merely of elementary overviews meant to provide a basic grasp of the major issues within these areas.<br>&emsp;&emsp;For the purposes of the GDL Contract exam there is no expectation that you will have read widely beyond the material set out here.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

However, certain important sub-rules are also present within it, either explicitly or implicitly, and should be noted.<br>&emsp;&emsp;An award of damages is compensatory; punitive or “exemplary” or “aggravated” damages are not awarded in contract. See <i>Perera v Vandiyar</i> (1953).<br>&emsp;&emsp;Loss must be strictly proven; if no loss can be shown, merely nominal damages will be awarded. However, as long as loss can clearly be shown, mere difficulty in quantifying it need not be fatal to a claim; see further below.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Compensation for loss is the criterion for quantification of damages; the fact that the defendant has coincidentally profited from the breach is not <b>normally</b> relevant.

See <i>Robinson v Harman</i> (1848) per Parke B.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Expectation loss is usually measured by the diminution in value of what the claimant has received as against the value he would have received if the contract had been correctly performed. The claimant is entitled to the difference between the two.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It follows that if this calculation discloses no loss (because the claimant made a bad bargain), then only nominal damages will be awarded.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Expectation damages may cover the cost of procuring the benefit intended to be provided by the contract – the cost of cure – but only where the cost of cure is proportionate to the disadvantage produced by the breach. See <i>Ruxley Electronics v Forsyth</i> (1996).<br>&emsp;&emsp;Instead of claiming expectation loss, the claimant may elect to claim reliance loss. Reliance loss consists of expenditure on the performance of the contract which has been wasted because of the defendant&#8217;s breach. See <i>Anglia TV v Reed</i> (1972).<br>&emsp;&emsp;A reliance claim will not succeed if it would clearly improve the claimant&#8217;s position over what it would have been if the contract had been performed. In other words, it cannot be used to escape the consequences of a bad bargain. See <i>C &amp; P Haulage v Middleton</i> (1983). A reliance claim is likely to appeal where the claimant&#8217;s expectation, albeit substantial and genuine, is difficult to prove.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Claims for expectation and reliance loss can be combined, subject to the fundamental principle that the combination must not produce “double recovery” (eg. recovery of profit and the expenses which would have been incurred in earning it). See <i>Millar&#8217;s Machinery v David Way &amp; Son</i> (1935).</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

For instance, the contract may be found too uncertain to be enforced, or it may be defeated by illegality, or terminated by frustration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The quantum meruit action is a means of obtaining restitution where a contract has failed but the claimant has conferred a valuable benefit on the defendant. Where the claimant has paid a sum of money to the defendant but received nothing in return because of the contract&#8217;s failure, the money may be recovered on a total failure of consideration. In the case of frustration, these restitutionary remedies are effectively codified and refined by the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 – see lecture 16.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The defendant may have made a profit out of breaching a contract, but that has caused no loss to the claimant. Clearly, the compensation principle does not function well as a rationale for requiring the disgorgement of profit here, <b>unless</b> the defendant has breached a fiduciary duty, a duty of confidence, or the claimant&#8217;s proprietary rights.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where there is no such breach of duty, disgorgement of profits may nevertheless exceptionally be ordered. The leading case is <i>Attorney General v Blake [2001] 1 AC 268</i>, in which the Government successfully prevented the payment of royalties to the defendant on the publication of his memoirs (a breach of contract) in the circumstance that he had been found guilty of treason as a KGB double agent, and had fled to Moscow after escaping prison.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The government suffered no loss by Blake&#8217;s profit, but was nevertheless held by a majority of the House of Lords to have an interest in performance such as to make it just and equitable that the defendant should retain no benefit from his breach of contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Although the juristic basis for requiring the disgorgement of profits is controversial, the general adoption of this approach has been suggested as a means of introducing some flexibility into remedial quantification. Two government reports have examined the issue, concluding that it should be left to be worked out by the common law rather than by legislation.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The claimant did not have to notify the advertiser of her intention to accept the offer prior to her performance of the conditions.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>(1) The advertisement stated that £1,000 was lodged at a bank. Therefore it could not be said that the statement that £100 would be paid was intended to be mere puff. It was an offer made to all the world, but there was no reason why an offer should not be made to all the world which was to ripen into a contract when anyone came forward and performed the condition required, Spencer v Harding (1869-70) L.R. 5 C.P. 561 considered. (2) Generally, when an offer was made, in order to make a binding contract it was necessary not only that it was accepted but that the acceptance was notified. However, the instant case was an exception to that rule; the notification of acceptance did not have to precede the performance. The person who made the offer could dispense with notice if he thought it desirable to do so. B had shown by its language and from the nature of the transaction that it did not expect and did not require notice of acceptance, apart from notice of the performance. Anyone who performed the conditions set out in the advertisement had accepted the offer, Williams v Carwardine 110 E.R. 590 and Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Co (1877) 2 App. Cas. 666 applied. The advertisement therefore contained all of the necessary elements to form a binding contract enforceable in law, save for two potential problems: firstly, it was not limited by time, and secondly the question of consideration. (3) A reasonable person would not understand B&#8217;s advertisement to mean that if a person used a smoke ball three times daily for two weeks they were guaranteed against contracting flu for the rest of their life. There were a number of reasonable constructions to be put on the advertisement but the preferred construction was that the reward was offered to any person who contracted flu in the current epidemic within a reasonable time after having used the smoke ball, or whilst using the ball. (4) A use by the public of the smoke ball as a result of the advertisement was directly beneficial to B. Therefore, B received an advantage which was enough to constitute a consideration. In addition, inconvenience sustained by one party at the request of the other was enough to create a consideration, Gerhard v Bates 118 E.R. 845 considered. The person who acted upon the advertisement put himself to some inconvenience at B&#8217;s request. That was ample consideration for B&#8217;s promise.</p></div></div> </div>

G was the tenant and occupier of a council house owned by M Corp, by whom he had been employed for 16 years. In November 1970, M Corp sent G a form and a brochure giving details of how he could buy the house. G completed the form and returned it, requesting information as to its price. In February 1971, M Corp wrote informing G of the price, and saying that if he wished to purchase the house, he should return the enclosed application. G completed the form, leaving the price blank, and returned it with a covering letter asking for consideration to be given to defects in the path to the house. M Corp replied that the price had been fixed according to the condition of the property. G wrote back asking the corporation to &#8220;carry on with the purchase as per my application.&#8221; M Corp took the house off the list of tenant-occupied houses and G did some work on the house. The political control of M Corp changed and they resolved not to sell council houses except where legally binding contracts had been previously concluded. G was notified that the sale would not proceed. On G&#8217;s claim, the county court judge found that the contract for sale was complete and ordered specific performance. On appeal by M Corp, held, dismissing the appeal (Geoffrey Lane L.J. dissenting), that in the light of the correspondence as a whole, and the conduct of the parties, there was a concluded agreement for the sale of the house.

D1, a Jersey trust company, was the registered holder of shares in a company in which the plaintiff company and D2 and his family owned shares. Whichever of the two groups acquired the trustees&#8217; shares would acquire control of the company. The trustees by telex invited P and D2 to make offers by sealed tender or confidential telex for the shares by 3 p.m. on September 16, 1981. The offers were to be confidential until that time, and were to be a single offer for all the shares. In the event of closing not taking place within 30 days &#8220;other than by reason of delay on the trustees&#8217; part&#8221; interest should be payable by the purchaser on the purchase price and the trustees agreed to accept the highest offer. P&#8217;s offer was CUSD 2,175,000 and D2&#8217;s CUSD 2,100,000 or CUSD 101,000 in excess of any other offer expressed as a fixed monetary amount, whichever is the higher. Calculated by reference to P&#8217;s offer, D2&#8217;s alternative offer (the referential bid) was CUSD 2,276,000. D1 accepted D2&#8217;s offer but P obtained an injunction preventing them doing so. The judge gave judgment for P on their claim for the shares and held that they were not liable to pay interest. The Court of Appeal allowed D2&#8217;s appeal. P&#8217;s appeal to the House of Lords was allowed.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; that whether D1 had invited P and D2 to take part in a fixed bid or an auction sale (where the price could be adjusted by reference to the other bid) depended upon their presumed intention, which was deduced from the terms of the invitation read as a whole. Their undertaking to accept the highest offer, the fact that the same invitation had been given to both, and their insistence on confidentiality showed that they wished to obtain the best price on a fixed bidding scale. The use of the word &#8220;offer&#8221; did not displace that presumed intention. D2 had not been entitled to submit or D1 to accept a referential bid ( South Hetton Coal Co v Haswell Shotton and Easington Coal and Coke Co [1898] 1 Ch. 465 approved; SSI Investors Ltd v Korea Tungsten Mining Co Ltd 449 N.Y.S.2d 173 applied). Although D1&#8217;s conduct in declining to complete with P was not blameworthy, since they thought mistakenly that they were under an obligation to accept D2&#8217;s referential bid, the failure to complete had been due to delay on their part within the meaning of the invitation and so they were not entitled to interest at the contractual penal rate imposed by the invitation. However P should not, in all the circumstances, have the benefit of the interest attributable to the purchase money as well as the profits attributable to the shares since October 15, 1981, and accordingly, as a condition of being granted specific performance, they should be required to pay interest to D1 on the purchase price of GBP 2,175,000 from that date until actual payment at the short term interest rate.</div></div> </div>

It stood in full view of passers-by. At night the warehouse was guarded by a mobile security officer who normally visited the warehouse four times nightly and for whose services the defendants contracted with the third parties. On the night in question, however, the security officer visited the warehouse three times only, his last visit finishing at 2.18 a.m. His fourth visit, if he had made it, would have been at about 5 a.m. At a time probably not long after the security officer&#8217;s third visit thieves broke into the warehouse and stole the whisky. The plaintiffs compensated the owners of the whisky in full and then sued the defendants for damages for negligence, the security officer&#8217;s employer company being joined as third parties.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; (1) that the defendant&#8217;s system of protection was not adequate in the circumstances and the defendants had failed to prove that the loss was not due to their negligence; (2) that the defendants, therefore, were liable in damages to the plaintiffs; (3) that the defendant&#8217;s liability was limited to GBP 800 per ton, the defendants&#8217; conditions of carriage being incorporated in the contract; and (4) that the judge&#8217;s finding that the third parties had been negligent, but that this negligence had not caused loss, would not be disturbed. Per curiam: apart from their original liability under (1) above, the defendants were liable for any negligence of the third parties. (Decision of Cairns J.

The plaintiff sellers offered to deliver a machine tool on condition that orders were only to be accepted on the terms set out in the quotation. The sellers&#8217; terms included a price variation clause. The defendant buyers replied with an order containing different terms and no price variation clause. The order had a tear-off slip of acknowledgment on those terms, which acknowledgment was duly signed by the sellers. Due to the buyers&#8217; delay in accepting delivery the sellers invoked the price variation clause. The sellers were successful at first instance but on appeal, held, allowing the appeal, that the buyers&#8217; reply was a counter offer which the sellers had accepted by their acknowledgment (Hyde v Wrench 49 E.R. 132 applied and Trollope &amp; Colls Ltd (t/a Nuclear Civil Constructions) v Atomic Power Constructions Ltd [1963] 1 W.L.R. 333 applied).</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The traditional analysis would conclude that the terms on S&#8217;s acknowledgment would be the terms on which the parties contracted. The judge gave weight to the fact that the connectors were items of considerable sophistication which were to be fitted into aero engine control systems so that delivery times and quality control were important; the pre-existing agreement between S and Goodrich which committed S to make supplies on terms which largely corresponded to those of B; and the fact that S did not mention its own terms before the service of the defence. The context of the parties&#8217; relationship was important but the factors on which the judge relied did not justify his conclusion. The fact that delivery times and quality control were essential was true in many commercial relationships and could be no more than a background factor. There was no precise matching between the terms of the agreement between S and Goodrich and B&#8217;s terms. The parties had had an opportunity to agree a single set of terms but did not do so. The terms of the post-dispute correspondence were not as significant as the judge thought. It could not be inferred from the correspondence that S&#8217;s never intended its terms and conditions to apply. Although the context of a long term relationship and the conduct of the parties might be strong enough to displace the result which a traditional offer and acceptance analysis would dictate, the circumstances were not strong enough to do so in the instant case. The judge should have held that S&#8217;s terms and conditions applied.</p></div></div> </div>

The defendant&#8217;s resolution did not breach the legislation because it did not seek to treat the Broads as a National Park, only to adopt the name for marketing purposes. The code contained in the 1949 Act was not specifically directed to the use of a brand name for a National Park. By virtue of the Local Government Act 1972 s.144 and s.265A, the defendant was empowered to encourage persons to visit the Broads for recreation. By s.2(7) of the 1988 Act and s.111 of the 1972 Act it could do anything necessary or expedient for enabling it to carry out its functions. Such functions included &#8220;promotion&#8221;; which included marketing the Broads to the public. The defendant&#8217;s objectives in adopting the brand name fell within the ambit of those provisions. Furthermore, it was legally possible to separate the use of &#8220;National Park&#8221; as a brand name from the legal status of a National Park. The phrase &#8220;National Park&#8221; had become established as an ordinary part of English language and National Park legislation had no legal monopoly over the use of the term. There was no basis on which to imply a Parliamentary intention to prohibit the use of the term &#8220;National Park&#8221; outside the code based upon the 1949 Act (see paras 26, 61, 67-69, 73, 75, 77 of judgment).</p><p>(2) Whether a statement or decision by a public body had the effect of misleading the public was an objective question; the court&#8217;s role was not limited to reviewing the decision on Wednesbury principles. The defendant&#8217;s branding decision had not had a misleading effect with regard to the Sandford Principle, and was not irrational. Even within a National Park, conservation did not have to be the uppermost consideration. Section 11A(2) of the 1949 Act only required the relevant authority to &#8220;have regard&#8221; to the twin purposes. It did not deal with all relevant considerations such as the need for development. The claimants&#8217; reliance upon the Sandford Principle as the key difference between the Broads and National Parks was unsustainable. Introducing the Sandford Principle into the Broads would involve amending legislation, and such amendments could not be contemplated without Parliament considering a number of matters. As the defendant was only adopting a brand name, and the legal regime within the Broads remained unaltered, the resolution was only concerned with how the Broads should be marketed. In order to make a lawful name choice, it had not been necessary for the defendant to decide about the introduction of the Sandford Principle (paras 6, 81-82, 85, 87, 91-92, 95, 97).</p><p>(3) The 2011 Plan did not seek to promote the adoption of the Sandford Principle. For that reason and others, the claimants&#8217; submissions regarding defective consultation failed (paras 104-112).</p></div></div> </div>

In so deciding, the Commercial Court declined to follow the decision in Kuwait Rocks Co v AMN Bulkcarriers Inc [2013] EWHC 865 (Comm), [2013] 2 All E.R. (Comm) 689 (The Astra).</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Judgment for claimant.<p>(1) J had had actual authority to bind the guarantor. Actual authority was governed by Chinese law and was established if the guarantor had expressly authorised J to sign the guarantees, had known that he was signing but had done nothing to repudiate his assertion of authority, or if J had been performing a duty-related activity in signing. The evidence showed that all those conditions were established. In any event, J had had ostensible authority, or the guarantor had ratified the guarantees by adopting them. The SAFE provisions were not applicable, Emeraldian Ltd Partnership v Wellmix Shipping Ltd (The Vine) [2010] EWHC 1411 (Comm), [2011] 1 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep. 301 applied (see paras 67-70, 78-91 of judgment). (2) The authorities were divided as to whether the payment of hire was a condition. Faced with the conflicting decisions of Tenax Steamship Co v Owners of the Motor Vessel Brimnes (The Brimnes) [1973] 1 W.L.R. 386 and Kuwait Rocks Co v AMN Bulkcarriers Inc [2013] EWHC 865 (Comm), [2013] 2 All E.R. (Comm) 689 (The Astra), the instant court followed the former, The Brimnes applied, The Astra not applied. In the absence of clear language, a contractual termination clause was to be treated as an option to cancel which did not confer greater rights to damages at common law than would otherwise exist, Financings Ltd v Baldock [1963] 2 Q.B. 104 followed. There was no such clear language in the instant charterparties, and so the withdrawal clause did not make payment of hire a condition. Nor would payment of hire be treated as a condition without the withdrawal clause. First, providing for an express right of withdrawal for non-payment suggested that, without such provision, there would be no such right. Second, there was a presumption in mercantile contracts that stipulations as to the time of payment were not conditions unless indicated in the contract. Third, breaches might range from the trivial to the serious, which pointed towards the withdrawal term being innominate, Bunge Corp v Tradax Export SA [1981] 1 W.L.R. 711 considered and Federal Commerce &amp; Navigation Co Ltd v Molena Alpha Inc (The Nanfri) [1979] A.C. 757 followed. Fourth, it could not have been intended that, without express agreement, fractionally late payment would entitle the owners to terminate the charter. Considerations of commercial certainty did not point to a different conclusion. Until The Astra , shipowners and charterers had operated on the footing that the payment of hire was not a condition, and the standard forms of time charter had not been altered to indicate that it was. Insofar as the dicta in A/S Tankexpress v Compagnie Financiere Belge des Petroles SA [1949] A.C. 76, Bunge , and Afovos Shipping Co SA v R Pagnan &amp; Fratelli (The Afovos) [1983] 1 W.L.R. 195 stated that payment of hire was a condition, they had not been made after argument and were counterbalanced by The Brimnes ; The Petrofina, Bunge and The Afovos considered (paras 92-95, 188-207). (3) The charterer had renounced the charterparties. Conduct falling short of repudiation might amount to renunciation if a reasonable observer would conclude that the charterer intended not to perform so as to deprive the shipowner of substantially its whole benefit (paras 208-212). (4) Where a charterer repudiated a time charter and, at the date of termination, there was an available market in which to let the vessel on for the full length of the unexpired term on materially equivalent terms save as to hire, damages were assessed by reference to the difference between the charterparty rate and the rate for the substitute charter. Where there was no such available market, the owner had to mitigate his loss by employing the vessel in a different way, and his loss was the difference between his actual earnings and what he would have earned under the original charterparty, Zodiac Maritime Agencies Ltd v Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (The Kildare) [2010] EWHC 903 (Comm), [2011] 2 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep. 360 and Glory Wealth Shipping Pte Ltd v Korea Line Corp (The Wren) [2011] EWHC 1819 (Comm), [2012] 1 All E.R. (Comm) 402 applied. The availability of shorter charters did not constitute an available market (paras 216-227). (5) The arbitration costs fell within the scope of the guarantees. They were losses incurred &#8220;as a result or arising out of&#8221; the charterer&#8217;s default within the meaning of the guarantees (paras 241-246).</p></div></div> </div>

Although a person who is let into exclusive possession is, prima facie, to be considered to be a tenant, nevertheless he will not be held to be so if the circumstances negative any intention to create a tenancy. Words alone may not suffice. Parties cannot turn a tenancy into a licence merely by calling it one. But if the circumstances and the conduct of the parties show that all that was intended was that the occupier should be granted a personal privilege with no interest in the land, he will be held only to be a licensee&#8221;: per Denning, L.J. In 1936 a father bought a house for his son and daughter-in-law to live in. The father put down GBP 250 in cash and borrowed GBP 500 from a building society on the security of the house, repayable with interest by instalments of 15s. a week. He took the house in his own name and made himself responsible for the instalments. The father told the daughter-in-law that the GBP 250 was a present for them, but he left them to pay the building society instalments of 15s. a week themselves. He handed the building society book to the daughter-in-law and said to her: &#8220;Don&#8217;t part with this book. The house will be your property when the mortgage is paid.&#8221; He said that when he retired he would transfer it into their names. The daughter-in-law paid the instalments regularly from that date onwards with the result that much of the mortgage had been repaid. The father, on being informed that the couple could not pay the rates, paid those also. In 1945 the father died leaving the house to his widow. Soon after, the son left his wife. The widow sued her daughter-in-law for possession of the house. Held, (1) there was no tenancy at will as the father could not revoke his promise once the couple entered on performance of the act: his promise would only cease to bind him if they left it incomplete and unperformed, which they had not done; (2) the 15s. which the couple paid was not rent as they were not bound to pay it: the father could not sue for it or distrain for it; he could only refuse to transfer the house to them; (3) the couple were licensees, having a permissive occupation short of a tenancy, but with a contractual right or, at any rate, an equitable right to remain so long as they paid the instalments, which would grow into a good equitable title to the house itself as soon as the mortgage was paid.

The claimant did not have to notify the advertiser of her intention to accept the offer prior to her performance of the conditions.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>(1) The advertisement stated that £1,000 was lodged at a bank. Therefore it could not be said that the statement that £100 would be paid was intended to be mere puff. It was an offer made to all the world, but there was no reason why an offer should not be made to all the world which was to ripen into a contract when anyone came forward and performed the condition required, Spencer v Harding (1869-70) L.R. 5 C.P. 561 considered. (2) Generally, when an offer was made, in order to make a binding contract it was necessary not only that it was accepted but that the acceptance was notified. However, the instant case was an exception to that rule; the notification of acceptance did not have to precede the performance. The person who made the offer could dispense with notice if he thought it desirable to do so. B had shown by its language and from the nature of the transaction that it did not expect and did not require notice of acceptance, apart from notice of the performance. Anyone who performed the conditions set out in the advertisement had accepted the offer, Williams v Carwardine 110 E.R. 590 and Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Co (1877) 2 App. Cas. 666 applied. The advertisement therefore contained all of the necessary elements to form a binding contract enforceable in law, save for two potential problems: firstly, it was not limited by time, and secondly the question of consideration. (3) A reasonable person would not understand B&#8217;s advertisement to mean that if a person used a smoke ball three times daily for two weeks they were guaranteed against contracting flu for the rest of their life. There were a number of reasonable constructions to be put on the advertisement but the preferred construction was that the reward was offered to any person who contracted flu in the current epidemic within a reasonable time after having used the smoke ball, or whilst using the ball. (4) A use by the public of the smoke ball as a result of the advertisement was directly beneficial to B. Therefore, B received an advantage which was enough to constitute a consideration. In addition, inconvenience sustained by one party at the request of the other was enough to create a consideration, Gerhard v Bates 118 E.R. 845 considered. The person who acted upon the advertisement put himself to some inconvenience at B&#8217;s request. That was ample consideration for B&#8217;s promise.</p></div></div> </div>

The possible difference in substantive outcome that might arise from identifying the contract correctly did not affect the adjudicator&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Application granted.<p>(1) It was reasonably arguable that the parties had proceeded on the basis of the promised letter of intent and subsequently on the basis of the letter of intent plus the emails. Under either of those routes, the Scheme for Construction Contracts (England and Wales) Regulations 1998 would have applied, with no specified adjudicator nominating body, so that the procedural route to adjudication would have been the same as if the 5 December 2014 email had formed the basis of the contract. However, there were a number of problems with the letter of intent. It referred to a form of JCT contract which did not exist. While it was clear that something had gone wrong with the language, it was not clear what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant, Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38, [2009] 1 A.C. 1101 followed. The JCT terms were not incorporated. In addition, no valuation schedule had been attached to the letter of intent, so there was no way of identifying the dates for payment. The mechanism provided by the letter was inoperable and inadequate. The defendant relied on emails to plug the gap left by the failure to provide a valuation schedule. However, even if the letter plus the emails was the proper basis for the parties&#8217; contractual obligations, they made payment conditional upon the performance of obligations under the main contract, which was an inadequate mechanism pursuant to the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 s.110. Therefore, the Scheme applied to establish the requisite date for payment and pay less notices. That meant there would have been no substantive difference in the adjudicator&#8217;s decision on the absence of a valid pay less notice (see paras 12-17, 20, 37 of judgment).</p><p>(2) It was also reasonably arguable that the claimant had accepted the sub-contract order by conduct. The Scheme would have applied with no specified nominating body so that the procedural route to adjudication would have been the same as if the December email formed the basis of the contract. It was reasonably arguable that, if operative, the sub-contract order made provision for payment, which meant that the adjudicator&#8217;s substantive decision was wrong (para.37).</p><p>(3) The court therefore had to consider what the position would be if the adjudicator had concluded that he had jurisdiction, but the proper contractual basis of jurisdiction could make a difference to the substantive outcome. The legal policy was that reasonably arguable challenges to an adjudicator&#8217;s jurisdiction might be a reason for not enforcing a decision, but the mere assertion that he had misunderstood the factual or legal basis for his substantive decision was not, Purton (t/a Richwood Interiors) v Kilker Projects Ltd [2015] EWHC 2624 (TCC), [2015] B.L.R. 754 applied. In the instant case, the adjudicator had jurisdiction because, however the contractual arrangements were correctly to be described, they mandated the use of the Scheme and he was properly appointed by the Scheme&#8217;s procedure. The possible difference in substantive outcome that could arise from identifying the contract correctly did not go to jurisdiction, but to substantive outcome only. If the adjudicator had made an error of law in referring to the wrong contractual provisions when deciding the substantive question referred to him, that fell within the category of errors of procedure, fact or law, which the Court of Appeal had repeatedly emphasised should not prevent enforcement, Carillion Construction Ltd v Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd [2005] EWHC 778 (TCC), [2005] B.L.R. 310 applied and C&amp;B Scene Concept Design Ltd v Isobars Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 46, [2002] C.L.C. 652 followed. The claimant was therefore entitled to enforce the award and summary judgment was entered in the claimant&#8217;s favour (paras 44-45, 52-54).</p></div></div> </div>

D&#8217;s communications had been made with the approval of the board of the remuneration committee. Since the HR director was a member of that board, no further endorsement by HR was necessary. Moreover, there was no reason why compliance could not be achieved by two documents. A change affecting a group of people did not need to be in writing, but needed only to be displayed on the company intranet. The August 18 announcement could be said to have been &#8220;displayed&#8221; on D&#8217;s intranet by reason of its having been broadcast, even if the broadcast could not be viewed after the event (see paras 52-54 of judgment); (b) there was overwhelming evidence that D had intended its promise to be legally binding. Where a term was being introduced into a pre-existing contractual relationship, there was a very strong presumption that it was intended to be legally binding, and the onus was on the party asserting that there was no intention to create legal relations to establish that fact. The natural inference was that any promises made to staff relating to the terms of their employment would take effect in the same way as other contractual terms. That was supported by a number of matters: D&#8217;s chief executive officer had made the promise, which implied that it must have been approved at the highest level; it was part of a vitally important staff retention strategy to prevent the potential collapse of the investment banking division; the nature of the promise assured staff that the fund was guaranteed come what may; and it was related to pay, the most fundamental obligation under the employment contract (paras 80-81, 89, 96); (c) D&#8217;s employees were under no obligation to communicate acceptance of the bonus offer. D had plainly dispensed with the need for any response: it had made a promise without any disadvantage to its employees, and nobody hearing the announcement would expect that an employee could only benefit if he positively accepted the offer. That would have had the bizarre result that even if only a minority of the relevant employees accepted the offer, D would have had to pay them the whole of the bonus pool. Even if there was no unilateral change pursuant to cl.1.4, there was a binding contractual obligation to pay bonus payments in the usual way, at least to the limits of the guaranteed fund (paras 97-100). (2) The introduction of the MAC clause was a breach of the implied duty of mutual trust and confidence. The judge had been entitled to find that the MAC clause had been introduced as a result of pressure from C, which had been concerned about the public&#8217;s negative perception of large bonus payments. He had objectively analysed the question of whether trust and confidence had been undermined and there was ample evidence to support his conclusion that it had (paras 130-140).</p></div></div> </div>

Only coils stowed in a particular part of the vessel, close to the hull of the ship had been damaged. The security and safety of the vessel itself had been the responsibility of the ship&#8217;s master. The contract of carriage incorporated the Hague Rules and M sought to rely on the Hague Rules Art.IV r.2c which precluded liability resulting from the perils of the sea. G contended that M had been negligent in ignoring the master&#8217;s advice as to stowage. G&#8217;s appeal against the dismissal of its claim was dismissed and it appealed.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that the evidence demonstrated no negligence on the part of M in effecting stability calculations. All such calculations had been within the parameters set by the master, who had operated the vessel adequately in the conditions. In considering whether or not events resulted from perils of the sea, it was necessary to have regard to the condition of the vessel, whether the events asserted as &#8220;perils&#8221; were unexpected or a &#8220;freak occurrence&#8221;, and the intensity of the conditions which had caused the damage. On the facts there was no evidence that M had been negligent in preparing the vessel for the voyage.

O had chartered a vessel to the respondent charterers (C) on an amended Centricon form for the carriage of a cargo of maize from Argentina to Algeria. A dispute had arisen about demurrage. C had failed to pay O&#8217;s claim for demurrage in full, and O decided to refer the dispute to arbitration under the charterparty arbitration clause and proposed the name of an arbitrator. C had put forward three other names. Within the 12 months permitted for appointment of an arbitrator under the charterparty arbitration clause, O had composed a reply by fax agreeing to the appointment of one of the arbitrators put forward by C. That fax and another fax chasing the matter some four months later had been sent to a wrong number and were never received by C. After another four months O had made contact with C and the proposed arbitrator (R) who had accepted the appointment. C disputed R&#8217;s jurisdiction on the basis that he had not been appointed within the 12 month period from final discharge prescribed by the charterparty arbitration clause. O submitted that (1) C&#8217;s offer to agree to the appointment of R as sole arbitrator had been accepted at the moment when the fax was sent to the wrong number; (2) alternatively, the offer to agree to the appointment of R as sole arbitrator had remained open for acceptance until O had purported to accept it; (3) there should if necessary be an extension of time under the Arbitration Act 1996 s.12(3)(a) .</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; refusing the applications, that (1) rules about offer and acceptance should be clear so that parties knew where they stood. A situation in which it was unclear whether a contract had been formed until a court decided the issue in the exercise of some form of general discretion would be unsatisfactory. Acceptance by post was complete as soon as the letter, properly addressed, was put into the post-box, Adams v Lindsell 106 E.R. 250 and Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corp [1955] 2 Q.B. 327 considered. If the letter was wrongly addressed different considerations applied. It was unfair to the intended recipient that he should be bound by something which he was unlikely to receive because of the fault of the sender. Any such rule had the potential of givng a careless would-be acceptor an unfair advantage. The postal rule should not apply to misdirected letters of acceptance. A misdirected acceptance should take effect, if at all, at the time which was least favourable to the party responsible for the misdirection. (2) The letter of offer was implicitly open for acceptance only within a reasonable period. The fax to R, which was copied to C, was sent approximately eight months after C&#8217;s offer to agree to the appointment of R. In the circumstances eight months was far in excess of a reasonable period for acceptance of C&#8217;s offer. It followed that there had been no agreement to the appointment of R, and that he had no jurisdiction under the charterparty. (3) An extension of time for commencement of the arbitral proceedings under s.12 was refused. The clerical error in failing to send the fax to the right number and an omission to chase matters up with any promptitude were not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time when the contract was made as the kind of circumstance that might trigger an extension of time, Harbour &amp; General Works Ltd v Environment Agency [2000] 1 W.L.R. 950 considered. It would not be just to extend the time for commencing arbitration proceedings in circumstances where C had the benefit of a contractual time bar.</div></div> </div>

We also undertake to cover you with an agreed commission on any other business transacted with your friends&#8221;. In return for this you are to put us in direct touch with your friends&#8221;. The plaintiffs thereupon put the defendants in direct touch with their friends and the defendants purchased first 1,000 oilskins and later 20,000 oilskins from one of these friends. When the plaintiffs claimed their commission on these transactions, the defendants repudiated liability on the ground that there was no legally enforceable bargain arising out of the letter, it being an agreement to pay a commission to be agreed and no further agreement having been reached, and that, even if the arrangement constituted an enforceable bargain, it was only a contract to pay commission on business arising directly from the introduction by the plaintiffs and the second transaction arose from an advertisement in a newspaper. Held, (1) there was nothing in the agreement limiting the commission to commission on orders directly attributable to the introduction, and, therefore, it included a transaction arising from an advertisement in a newspaper; (2) the commission was payable in respect of every subsequent transaction with friends who had originally been introduced by the plaintiffs; (3) the agreement was not confined to oilskins but also applied to entirely different commodities; and (4) &#8220;to cover you with an agreed commission&#8221; meant in the circumstances of the case to cover you with a reasonable commission and such a condition was not too vague to be enforceable, because a jury properly directed would be able to arrive at a proper conclusion as to what in the circumstances of this case was a reasonable commission.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

High Trees House [1947-51] C.L.Y. 5601 , does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties. In none of the decided cases was the defendant sued on a promise, assurance or assertion as a cause of action in itself. He was sued for some other cause, for example, a pension or a breach of contract, or possession, and the promise, assurance or assertion only played a supplementary role, though, no doubt, an important one. That is its true function. It may be part of a cause of action, but it is not a cause of action in itself. The principle is that where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the one who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to their previous legal relations as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced, even though the promise or assurance is not supported in point of law by any consideration. A divorced husband agreed in writing in 1943 to allow his former wife GBP 100 a year free of tax by way of permanent maintenance. Being aware that he was not then in good financial circumstances, she made no claim to permanent maintenance then. But in 1950 she brought an action on the agreement claiming arrears under it. Held, the wife could only enforce the agreement in writing for the payment of maintenance if there was consideration for it; there was no evidence of any intention by the husband that the wife should forbear from applying to the Court for maintenance, or, in other words, any request by the husband, express or implied, that the wife should so forbear; her forbearance was not intended by him, nor was it done at his request; therefore, it did not amount to consideration for the husband&#8217;s promise. As a result the wife could not recover the arrears.

One company was prepared to offer GBP 100,000 for the land, and in answer to the taxpayer&#8217;s question &#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221; a director of the company said that the taxpayer would be paid GBP 10,000 if the company purchased the land for GBP 100,000 or less.

When the bank asked the taxpayer for his comments on the offer of GBP 100,000 for the sale, he replied that he personally would accept it, but he made no further recommendations. The sale for GBP 100,000 was completed and the taxpayer received the promised GBP 10,000 from the company. He was assessed to income tax on this sum.

The plaintiffs agreed to sell their shares in a private company to a company of which the defendants were majority shareholders in consideration of the issue to them of shares in the purchasing company. So as not to depress the market value of such shares the plaintiffs further agreed with the defendants that they would not sell 60 per cent of the newly issued shares until April 1974, the defendants agreeing, so that the plaintiffs might be protected against a fall in the value of the shares during such period, to purchase them at the end of that period at USD 2.50 each. Shortly afterwards the plaintiffs realised that the effect of such subsidiary agreement would be to deprive them of any increase in the value thereof. They therefore refused to complete the main agreement unless the defendants in substitution for the subsidiary agreement agreed to indemnify them against any reduction in value of the shares below the price of USD 2.50 each during the deferment period. The defendants, fearing the consequences of delay in completion of the main agreement, so agreed, the agreement being expressed to be in consideration of the plaintiffs having agreed to sell their shares in the private company. The main agreement was performed, and thereafter the value of the shares fell below USD 2.50 each.

They were cases in which a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact acted on. In such cases, the courts had said that the promise had to be honoured. In each case, the court held the promise to be binding on the party making it, even though under the old common law it might be difficult to find any consideration for it. The courts had not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a promise, but they had refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it. It was in that sense, and that sense only, that such a promise gave rise to an estoppel. The time had now come for the validity of such a promise to be recognised. The logical consequence, no doubt, was that a promise to accept a smaller sum in discharge of a larger sum, if acted on, was binding notwithstanding the absence of consideration; and if the fusion of law and equity led to that result, so much the better. A binding promise had been made in the instant case. As to the scope of that promise, the evidence showed that C had agreed that the ground rent would be reduced to £1,250 a year as a temporary expedient while the block of flats was not fully, or substantially fully, let owing to the conditions prevailing. When the flats became fully let, early in 1945, the reduction ceased to apply. Rent was therefore payable at the full rate for the last two quarters of 1945.</p></div></div> </div>

D&#8217;s son was also fined, and ordered to pay GBP 525 in costs. The justices gave reasons for their award of costs.

The justices&#8217; reasons disclosed that they took into account the irrelevant matters of the source of the local authority&#8217;s revenue and its duty to prosecute such cases.

In such cases, no notice of any kind may be necessary. But in other cases, where there is nothing to fix the end of the period which may be dependent on the will of the person who has made the concession, equity will, no doubt, require some notice together with a reasonable period for re-adjustment before the grantor is allowed to enforce his strict rights. In such cases the notice need not take any particular form, nor need it specify a date for the termination of the period. The principle should be applied with great caution to purely creditor-and-debtor relationships which involve no question of forfeiture or cancellation. In 1938 the plaintiffs, who were the registered proprietors of letters patent relating to hard metal alloys, granted the defendants a licence under the patents to sell and use the contract material on payment of a royalty of 10 per cent on the net value of all contract material sold or used. The agreement further provided that if the aggregate quantity of the contract material sold or used by the defendants other than contract materials supplied to them by the plaintiffs or their licensees under the patents should exceed a quota of fifty kilograms in any month, they should pay to the plaintiffs compensation equal to 30 per cent of the sum which represented the excess net value. The compensation or penalty rates presented the defendants with an ever-increasing burden by reason of the growth in production resulting from war-time requirements. As a result the plaintiffs decided that they would not continue to demand payment of the compensation under the agreement and in fact did not enforce such payment throughout the war. The defendants thereupon based their production policy on the footing that only the 10 per cent royalty would be payable whilst the arrangement continued in force. In July, 1945, the defendants commenced proceedings against the plaintiffs, claiming damages for fraud. By their counterclaim (which was delivered with the defence on March 26, 1946), the plaintiffs alleged that since March 31, 1942, the defendants had sold and used contract material, some of which was made in accordance with the revelant patents, but, in breach of their obligations under the deed, had not since that date rendered any accounts or paid the sums due for royalties and compensation. They waived their claim to enforce payment of compensation in respect of deliveries made before the end of hostilities with Germany. Devlin, J. dismissed the action, the defendants having failed to establish the charges of fraudulent misrepresentation, but he gave judgment for the plaintiffs on the counterclaim holding that the arrangement for suspension of payment of compensation had been terminated by the presentation of a new agreement to the defendants. The Court of Appeal held that the presentation of the new agreement did not operate to determine the arrangement for suspension and held that up to the date of the counterclaim no notice requiring the payment of compensation had been given. In the present proceedings the plaintiffs alleged that the delivery of the counterclaim in the first action was a sufficient notice of their intention to enforce payment of compensation and that the time between the delivery of the counterclaim and January 1, 1947, was a reasonable time.

L, challenging the existence of an apprenticeship, contended that the arrangement was educational in nature, not commercial, and that it was not enforceable due to a lack of consideration. The court, while finding that a binding contract did exist, held that E was not an apprentice nor a &#8220;worker&#8221; within the meaning of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, because there had been no expectation upon her to do any work for L or do anything other than further her own training.</p><p>E accepted an unpaid 12 month pupillage with a barristers&#8217; chambers. In friendly litigation brought at the Bar Council&#8217;s instigation, E sought and was granted declarations ([2000] I.R.L.R. 18) that her acceptance of the pupillage created an apprenticeship contract, that she was a &#8220;worker&#8221; within the meaning of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 s.54(3)(a) and that, being over 26 years old, she was entitled by virtue of the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 Reg.12 to be paid the national minimum wage during her pupillage. L, a barrister belonging to the chambers, appealed, contending that the offer to provide E with education and training was not enforceable as a contract since there had been no intention to create legal relations and E had provided no consideration. Furthermore, L argued, the relationship between the parties was regulated by Bar Council guidelines relating to pupillage which rendered a further contract unnecessary.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that (1) there was a binding contract for the provision of education and training which impliedly incorporated regulatory materials governing pupillage; (2) a broad view had to be taken of the relationship between E and the barristers&#8217; chambers. It was in the chambers&#8217; long term interests to attract talented pupils and, regardless of whether E was a prospective candidate for tenancy or not, her agreement to that potentially productive relationship had been consideration for the offer, and (3) the construction of &#8220;apprenticeship&#8221; in s.54(2) of the 1998 Act was intended to be unlegalistic and covered learned professions. However, a cardinal ingredient of an apprenticeship was a mutual covenant whereby the master undertook to educate and train the apprentice, who, in return, was bound to serve and work for the master. In the instant case, there had been no expectation on E to provide valuable service and she was not obliged to do anything which was not conducive to her own training, hence she did not work under a contract of apprenticeship or an equivalent contract.</div></div> </div>

O had left the key in M&#8217;s charge, and it was M&#8217;s duty to take reasonable care to see that it was not taken by an unauthorised person. It had been taken, and reasonably foreseeable consequences had followed: a thief had used it to steal from the room. (2) M could not rely on the notice in the bedroom. It could not form part of the contract. Those relying on a contract to exempt themselves from common law liability had to strictly prove its terms and the intention to create legal relations. The best way of proving intention was by a written document signed by the party to be bound. Another way was handing him before or at the time of the contract a written notice specifying its terms and making it clear that the contract was on those terms. The same effect could be achieved by a prominent public notice made plain for the party to see when he made the contract, or by an express oral stipulation. Nothing short of one of those ways would suffice. Notices put up in bedrooms did not make a contract: as a rule, guests did not see them until after they had been accepted as guests. (3) The question of whether, had O agreed to be bound by it, the notice would have exempted M from liability for its negligence should not depend on whether the hotel was a common inn with the liability of an insurer, or a private hotel with liability only for negligence. It should depend on the words of the contract. In order to exempt a person from liability for negligence, the exemption should be clear on the face of the contract; it should not depend on what view the courts might take of the nature of the hotel. Whether it was a common inn or a private hotel, a notice in the terms of that in the instant case would not exempt the hotel from liability for negligence but only from any liability as insurer. The notice could be construed as a warning that the hotel was not liable in the absence of negligence. As such it served a useful purpose of warning the guest to take care of his things; it was unnecessary to go further and construe it as a contractual exemption.</p></div></div> </div>

A &#8220;warranty&#8221; denotes a binding promise. The word is also used in order to denote a subsidiary term in a contract as distinct from a vital term which is called a &#8220;condition.&#8221; 3. A warranty as a statement which is a term of the contract must be distinguished from an innocent misrepresentation. The distinction is best expressed by the ruling of Holt C.J. in Pasley v. Freeman , &#8220;was it intended as a warranty or not?&#8221; 4. The question whether a warranty was intended depends upon the conduct of the parties, on their words and behavior, rather than on their thoughts. If an intelligent bystander would reasonable infer that a warranty was intended, that will suffice. And this, when the facts are not in dispute, is a question of law. 5. When the seller states a fact which is or should be within his own knowledge and of which the buyer is ignorant, intending that the buyer should act on it and he does so, it is easy to infer a warranty. So also if the seller makes a promise about something which is or should be within his own control. If, however, the seller, when he states a fact, makes it clear that he has no knowledge of his own but has got his information elsewhere, and is merely passing it on, it is not so easy to imply a warranty. 6. If an oral representation is afterwards recorded in writing, it is good evidence that it was intended as a warranty. If it is not put into writing, it is evidence against a warranty being intended; but it is by no means decisive. The defendant sold to the plaintiffs, who were motor traders, a Morris car, which according to the registration book was first registered in 1948, for GBP 290. Eight months later the plaintiffs discovered that the car was made in 1939. If they had known this they would have given only GBP 175 for it. The defendant honestly believed that it was a 1948 model. The plaintiffs claimed damages for breach of contract.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; on the facts, the defendant, in offering a 1948 Morris and producing the registration book, did not intend to bind himself so as to warrant that it was a 1948 model; accordingly the plaintiffs&#8217; claim failed.

The maker of the representation can rebut this by showing that he was entirely innocent of fault in making it and that it would not be reasonable in the circumstances for him to be bound by it. During negotiations for the purchase of a second-hand Bentley the seller said it had done only 20,000 miles since fitted with a replacement engine and gearbox. This was wrong, the true figure being nearer 100,000, as the seller could have discovered by asking the manufacturer. On a claim for damages for breach of warranty as to this mileage, held that it was a warranty, not a mere innocent misrepresentation, and the action succeeded.

Accordingly, while the main reason for leasing the aircraft was to mitigate the consequences of K&#8217;s breaches of contract, that reason did not justify leasing the aircraft for three years rather than two. The choice of a three-year rather than a two-year lease term was driven by other commercial considerations. The decision to lease the aircraft for a third year was not a step which was taken nor which it would have been reasonable for T to take in mitigation of loss and was therefore not attributable to K&#8217;s breaches of contract. K had failed to prove that the net benefits which T had obtained from having the three leased aircraft in its fleet during the first two years of the leases were sufficient to offset all the losses resulting from the delayed entry into service, or the restricted use, of the aircraft caused by K&#8217;s breaches of contract. T was entitled to recover lease costs of $107 million (see paras 56, 62, 138-139 of judgment). (2) If as a result of buying lighter replacement seats in mitigation of its loss T had saved or would save money, the amount saved would have to be brought into account in the assessment of damages. However, the burden of proof was on K to establish the fact and amount of any such saving. It had not discharged that burden in relation to what were known as the Recaro seats. However, in relation to what were known as the ZIM seats, the expert evidence did justify a finding that T had incurred a saving which should be brought into account (paras 144, 152, 158). (3) T had obtained a price reduction from the supplier of the aircraft in which K&#8217;s seats were to be installed. There were two effective causes of that reduction: K&#8217;s breach of contract and the bargaining power which T was able to exploit through being a good customer of the supplier. When the defendant&#8217;s breach of contract combined with another effective cause to result in loss to the claimant, the loss was recoverable; the same principle had to apply to gains. Credit had therefore to be given in the calculation of damages for the benefit to T of the price reduction. Further, T had been granted various credits on the purchase of new aircraft after the relevant events. Three credits remained in dispute. One was a credit to offset the amount of an invoice which the supplier had issued to T claiming &#8220;disruption costs&#8221; resulting from the delayed delivery caused by K&#8217;s breaches. T had failed to prove that it was liable to pay the sum offset and was therefore not entitled to recover that sum from K. The receipt by T of the other two credits had not been caused by K&#8217;s breaches of contract. It was reasonable to infer that the supplier would have been willing to make similar credits available to T as an incentive to buy new aircraft irrespective of the problems caused by K&#8217;s breaches of contract. Those credits were therefore not to be brought into account in the assessment of damages (paras 172, 176-179, 187-188, 191).</p></div></div> </div>

There was no clearly established case for departing from the exclusionary rule, even though it might mean that in some cases parties would be bound by a contract in terms which, upon a full investigation of the course of negotiations, a reasonable observer would not have taken them to have intended, Prenn considered. There was a power to depart from the rule, but that power was only intended to be applied in a small number of cases in which previous decisions of the House were thought to be impeding the proper development of the law or to have led to results which were unjust or contrary to public policy, Jones v Secretary of State for Social Services [1972] A.C. 944 considered; (b) Evidence could be adduced that the parties to a contract habitually used words in an unconventional sense in order to support an argument that words in the contract should bear a similar unconventional meaning (the &#8220;private dictionary&#8221; principle). However, the decision in Partenreederei MS Karen Oltmann v Scarsdale Shipping Co (The Karen Oltmann) [1976] 2 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep. 708 , which involved a choice between two perfectly conventional meanings of the word &#8220;after&#8221;, was an illegitimate extension of the &#8220;private dictionary&#8221; principle which, taken to its logical conclusion, would destroy the exclusionary rule and any advantages which it might have, The Karen Oltmann considered. (3) (Obiter) Joscelyne v Nissen [1970] 2 Q.B. 86 extended the availability of rectification to cases where there had not been any enforceable prior agreement, Joscelyne considered. In considering rectification, the question was what an objective observer would have thought the parties&#8217; intentions were, Frederick E Rose (London) Ltd v William H Pim Junior &amp; Co Ltd [1953] 2 Q.B. 450 and Etablissements Levy (Georges et Paul) v Adderley Navigation Co Panama SA (The Olympic Pride) [1980] 2 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep. 67 considered. Evidence as to what terms a party understood to have been agreed could be significant in a case where the prior consensus was based on oral exchanges or conduct, but where the prior consensus was expressed entirely in writing such evidence was likely to carry very little weight, Carmichael v National Power Plc [1999] 1 W.L.R. 2042 and George Cohen Sons &amp; Co Ltd v Docks and Inland Waterways Executive (1950) 84 Ll. L. Rep. 97 considered. However, it would not be inadmissible. In the instant case, on the assumption that the judge was right in his construction of the ARP definition, both parties were mistaken in thinking that it reflected their prior consensus, so P was entitled to rectification.</p></div></div> </div>

The proposition that the implication of a term was an exercise in the construction of the relevant instrument as a whole was not only a matter of logic (as a court had no power to alter what the instrument meant) but also well supported by authority. In every case in which it was said that some provision ought to be implied in an instrument, the question for the court would be whether such a provision would spell out in express words what the instrument, read against the relevant background, would reasonably be understood to mean. It would be noticed from Lord Pearson&#8217;s speech in Trollope &amp; Colls Ltd v North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board [1973] 1 W.L.R. 601 that that question could be reformulated in various ways which a court might find helpful in providing an answer - the implied term had to &#8220;go without saying&#8221;, it had to be &#8220;necessary to give business efficacy to the contract&#8221; and so on - but those were not to be treated as different or additional tests. There was only one question, namely what the instrument, read as a whole against the relevant background, would reasonably be understood to mean. In BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings 180 C.L.R. 266, Lord Simon of Glaisdale had said that the following conditions had to be met before a term could be implied: it had to be reasonable and equitable; it had to be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term would be implied if the contract was effective without it; it had to be so obvious that &#8220;it [went] without saying&#8221;; it had to be capable of clear expression; further, it had not to contradict any express term of the contract. That list was best regarded, not as series of independent tests which had each to be surmounted, but rather as a collection of different ways in which judges had tried to express the central idea that the proposed implied term had to spell out what the contract actually meant, or in which they had explained why they did not think that it did so, Trollope, BP Refinery, Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman [2002] 1 A.C. 408 and Moorcock, The (1889) 14 P.D. 64 considered. (2) The Court of Appeal had been wrong not to imply the term argued for by X into the article. The implication was required to avoid defeating what appeared to have been the overriding purpose of the machinery of appointment and removal of directors, namely to ensure that the board reflected the appropriate shareholder interests in accordance with the scheme laid out in the articles.</p></div></div> </div>

In an action brought by the council for possession of a maisonette on the ninth floor of a 15- storey tower block, the tenants, who had withheld rent in protest against the appalling state of repair of, in particular, the lifts and staircases in the building, counterclaimed for damages for breach of a duty to repair and maintain the common parts of the building. The council had made repeated efforts at considerable expense to keep the lifts in working order and to provide safe access to the maisonettes but their efforts had been frustrated by incessant vandalism. The county court judge awarded nominal damages for breach of an implied duty to keep the common parts in repair. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held, Lord Denning M.R. dissenting, that there was no such duty. On appeal to the House of Lords, held, allowing the appeal, that where an essential means of access to units in a building was retained in the landlord&#8217;s occupation, then unless the obligation to maintain them was clearly placed on the tenants, the nature of the contract and circumstances required that it should be placed on the landlord. The obligation, however, was to take reasonable care to keep the means of access in reasonable repair and usability with the recognition that the tenants had the responsibilities of a reasonable set of tenants, and there had not been shown to be any breach of such obligation by the council.

Ps were medical practitioners employed by Ds in Northern Ireland under contracts of employment which incorporated the regulations from time to time in force governing superannuation rights and liabilities of persons employed in the Health Service. Under the 1962 Regulations an employee had to complete 40 years&#8217; contributory service to qualify for a full pension. The 1974 Regulations gave employees the right to purchase &#8220;added years&#8221; on certain terms, to qualify for a full pension. The right was exercisable within 12 months of February 10, 1975, by persons already employed and within 12 months by persons taking up employment thereafter. There was a discretion to extend the 12-month time limit and to vary the terms of purchase when the time limit was extended. The 1983 Regulations removed this discretion and substituted a new less favourable right to purchase. Ps were not given notice of their right to purchase &#8220;added years&#8221; and accordingly failed to take up their rights before the 1983 Regulations came into force. Ps brought claims against Ds claiming an implied breach of contract and breach of statutory duty under s.4(1) of the 1965 Act. At trial the claims based on breach of statutory duty were abandoned. The judge dismissed the other claims. The Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland permitted Ps to revive the claims based on breach of statutory duty and allowed the appeal.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing Ds&#8217; appeal, that (1) where the terms of an employee&#8217;s contract of employment had not been negotiated with the individual employee but resulted from negotiations with a representative body or were otherwise incorporated by reference, and a particular term of the contract made available to the employee a valuable right contingent upon his taking action to avail himself of its benefit and the employee could not, in all the circumstances, reasonably be expected to be aware of the term unless it was drawn to his attention, it was an implied term of the contract that the employer was under an obligation to take reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the employee. Accordingly, there was such an implied term in Ps&#8217; contract of which Ds were in breach; (2) the actions were not time-barred because Ds had been in breach of a continuing obligation to bring the right to purchase &#8220;added years&#8221; to Ps&#8217; attention under the 1974 Regulations until they were superseded by the 1983 Regulations. Per curiam: a breach by an employer of the duty imposed by s.4(1) of the 1965 Act to give an employee written particulars of the terms of his employment is remediable only by recourse to an industrial tribunal as provided by s.5 and confers no civil right of action in the employee founding in damages.</div></div> </div>

C was a senior employee and director of F. Under his contract of employment he was entitled, if absent from work due to illness, to be paid his full salary for up to six months&#8217; absence and thereafter such remuneration as the board of F might in its discretion allow. He was a member of F&#8217;s long term disability insurance scheme, under which he was entitled, so long as he remained an employee of F, to the payment of benefits in the event that he was &#8220;totally unable by reason of sickness....to follow his occupation&#8221;, and thereafter to payment of such benefits as the scheme&#8217;s insurer might think fit. C suffered a nervous breakdown which rendered him unfit for further work and he consequently submitted a claim under the scheme. Terms were discussed between C and F in relation to C&#8217;s retirement, as a result of which C wrote a letter, in terms suggested by F, in which he tendered his resignation with effect from June 1997. As a consequence of that letter C ceased to be entitled under the scheme to payments of benefit as of right after June 1997, and the scheme insurer only continued to make discretionary payments until June 1998. C sought damages representing past and future loss of benefit on the basis that F had acted in breach of an implied term of his contract of employment to take reasonable care of C&#8217;s economic well being by (i) asking him to submit a resignation letter knowing the effect that that would have on C&#8217;s right to benefits under the scheme, or (ii) failing to warn him of the effect that the letter would have on his entitlement to those benefits.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that the judge had been right to reject the proposition that it was an implied term of every contract of employment that an employer ought to take reasonable care of an employee&#8217;s economic well being. In deciding whether such a term was to be implied, it was better to focus on questions of reasonableness, fairness and the balancing of competing policy considerations rather than on the elusive concept of &#8220;necessity&#8221;. The implication of such a term would introduce a major extension of the relevant law, when in the recent decisions of Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board [1992] 1 A.C. 294 and Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc [1995] 2 A.C. 296 the House of Lords had refused to do so. Secondly, such an implied term would impose an unfair and unreasonable burden upon employers, Scally , Spring , University of Nottingham v Eyett (No.1) [1999] 2 All E.R. 437 and Hagen v ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd [2002] I.R.L.R. 31 applied, Outram v Academy Plastics Ltd [2001] I.C.R. 367 considered, Reid v Rush &amp; Tompkins Group [1990] 1 W.L.R. 212 doubted. On the evidence, it was clear that C had decided to retire on his own initiative. F had not caused or contributed to that decision. It was equally clear that F was reasonably entitled to conclude that C knew, or reasonably had open to him the means of finding out, the terms of the scheme, including those as to cessation of the right to benefit on termination of employment.</div></div> </div>

If the clause contains language which expressly exempts A, the person in whose favour it is made, from the consequence of the negligence of his own servants, effect must be given to that provision. 2. If there is no express reference to negligence, the court must consider whether the words used are wide enough, in their ordinary meaning, to cover negligence on the part of the servants of A. If a doubt arises at this point, it must be resolved against A. 3. If the words used are wide enough for the above purpose, the court must then consider whether the head of damage may be based on some ground other than that of negligence. The other ground must not be so fanciful or remote that A cannot be supposed to have desired protection against it; but, subject to this qualification, the existence of a possible head of damage other than that of negligence is fatal to A even if the words used are, prima facie, wide enough to cover negligence on the part of his servants. The appellants, a Quebec company, presented a petition of right against the Crown, alleging that a fire in a freight shed occupied by the appellants under a lease from the Crown was caused by the negligence of the Crown&#8217;s servants and that goods to the value of half a million dollars, of which 40,000 dollars-worth of goods belonged to the appellant and the remainder to others, were destroyed. The fire occurred when servants of the Crown were doing repairs in the shed at the request of the appellants. Part of the work consisted of drilling a hole in a steel beam and for this purpose an oxy-acetylene cutting torch was used instead of a hand drill. Sparks from the torch fell on some bales of cotton waste in the shed and started a fire which destroyed the shed and all its contents. In answer to the petition the Crown denied negligence but alleged that, if they were guilty of negligence, cl. 7 of the lease exempted them from any liability to the appellants. Cl. 7 provided: &#8220;That the lessee shall not have any claim or demand against the lessor for . . . damage . . . to the said shed.. . or to any . . . goods . . . at any time . . . being . . . in the said shed.&#8221; The Crown also brought in the appellants as third parties to the petition of six other petitioners who had suffered loss in the fire, alleging that if the Crown were guilty of negligence the appellants were liable to indemnify the Crown against the consequences of its negligence under cl. 17 which provided: &#8220;That the lessee shall at all times indemnify . . . the lessor from and against all claims and demands loss costs damages actions suits or other proceedings. . . in any manner based upon occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these presents or any action. . . done. . . by virtue hereof . . .&#8221; It was shown that by the law of Quebec the lessor would be liable for damage to the shed without any negligence on his part if such damage were caused by an inherent defect in the shed, by the operations of a third party on adjacent land, or by the act of a trespasser. Held, (1) under cl. 7 the Crown had failed to limit its liability in respect of negligence in clear terms; (2) even if the words in cl. 17 &#8220;any action done by virtue hereof&#8221; could be applied to a negligent act done in the course of carrying out an obligation, the head of damage might be based on some ground other than that of negligence, and, for this reason and also because the Crown had failed to impose on the appellants in clear terms the burdensome obligation of an indemnity for the whole of the damage by the Crown however negligent its servants might be, the Crown&#8217;s claim for an indemnity under cl. 17 also failed.

If in those circumstances the representor gave information or advice which was negligent he would be liable for any pecuniary or personal damage caused to the inquirer, but where the representor had expressly excluded responsibility for reliance on his statement no liability arose.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>(1) (Per Lord Reid) The principle in Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562 had no direct bearing on the instant case. Donoghue set out to reflect the standards of the reasonable man but reasonable people often stated opinions without taking care, so the law had to treat words and acts differently . It was clear that liability for negligent misstatement could not be founded on the Donoghue principle alone; something more was required, namely that the representor had expressly or impliedly undertaken responsibility for their statement, Donoghue considered. The decision in Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App. Cas. 337 had not established any universal rule that, in the absence of any contract, an innocent (not fraudulent) but negligent misrepresentation could not give rise to an action, Nocton v Lord Ashburton [1914] A.C. 932 applied, Derry considered. In the light of the decision in Robinson v National Bank of Scotland Ltd 1916 S.C. (H.L.) 154, concerning a duty of care arising from other &#8220;special relationships&#8221;,there was no logical stopping place short of all those relationships where the party seeking the advice was reasonably trusting the other to exercise such a degree of care as the circumstances required, and where the representor knew or should reasonably have known that the inquirer would rely on him, Robinson applied, Candler v Crane Christmas &amp; Co [1951] 2 K.B. 164 overruled, Le Lievre v Gould [1893] 1 Q.B. 491 not followed and Cann v Willson (1888) 39 Ch. D. 39 approved. The relevant question in the instant case was whether an undertaking to assume a duty to take care could be inferred. Since H&#8217;s inquiry had been requested &#8220;without responsibility&#8221; from X, it was clear that no such duty could be inferred. (2) (Per Lord Morris) It should be regarded as settled that if someone possessed of a special skill undertook, irrespective of contract, to apply that skill for the assistance of another person who relied upon such skill, a duty of care should arise. That the service was given by words made no difference. Where a person was so placed that others could reasonably rely on his skill, and that person allowed his advice to be passed on to another whom he knew or should have known would rely on it, a duty of care also arose. (3) (Per Lord Hodson) A banker giving references as to credit-worthiness was not under a legal obligation to do more than to give honest answers to the best of his actual knowledge. However, in accordance with Lord Morris, where a person gave advice in the knowledge that it would reasonably be relied upon, a duty of care arose. (4) (Per Lord Devlin) The problem in issue was a by-product of the doctrine of consideration in English law. The special relationship required to establish a duty of care arose in relationships &#8220;equivalent to contract&#8221; where there was an assumption of responsibility which, but for the absence of consideration, would constitute a contract. The responsibility was not one implied by law, but one which was voluntarily accepted either generally where a general relationship was created or specifically in relation to a particular transaction. Where there was a general relationship (such as that of solicitor/client, banker/customer, although there were others yet to be established) it was unnecessary to prove any more than its existence, and the duty followed. Where a particular relationship was created ad hoc (as in the instant case) the facts had to be examined to see if there was an express or implied undertaking of responsibility. (5) (Per Lord Pearce) To import a duty of care, the relationship between the parties had normally to concern a business or professional transaction whose nature made clear the gravity of the inquiry.</p></div></div> </div>

Auditors of a public company routinely preparing accounts, in contrast to the preparation of a report for a specific purpose for an identified party, owed no duty to the public at large who might place reliance on company accounts when making investment decisions. To impose such a liability would open the floodgates to an indeterminately wide class of people, JEB Fasteners Ltd v Marks Bloom &amp; Co [1981] 3 All E.R. 289 distinguished. Furthermore, it was necessary to impose some limit on liability for economic loss arising in the absence of a contractual relationship between the parties.</div></div> </div>

In negotiations leading to a contract, the statute imposes an absolute obligation not to state facts which the representor cannot prove he had reasonable grounds to believe. A Ltd, civil engineering contractors, entered negotiations with H Ltd for the hire of two sea-going barges, owned by H Ltd, for carrying vast quantities of clay out to sea. At a meeting on July 11, 1974, the owners&#8217; marine manager orally represented to A Ltd that the capacity of the barges was 1,600 tonnes deadweight. He based that figure on his recollection of an entry in Lloyd&#8217;s Register which gave the capacities as 1,800 tonnes. The Register was erroneous, and the correct deadweight capacity was 1,055 tonnes, which could have been ascertained from the ship&#8217;s document in possession of H Ltd A Ltd continued negotiations without obtaining any other figure for the vital matter of deadweight capacity, and took the barges into use under a charterparty. The charterparty included an exception clause that the charterers&#8217; acceptance at handing over the barges should be conclusive that they had examined them and found them fit for their purpose. After about six months&#8217; use, A Ltd discovered the correct capacity and paid GBP 20,000 for the hire, refusing to pay any more. H Ltd withdrew the barges and issued proceedings claiming outstanding hire charges. A Ltd denied liability, and counterclaimed for damages alleging, inter alia, (1) breaches of collateral warranties in the representations before contract; (2) negligence arising from a special relationship between the parties and (3) liability under s.2(1) of the Act. Bristow, J. gave judgment for H Ltd On appeal by A Ltd, and cross-notice by H Ltd, held, allowing the appeal in part, that (1) there was nothing in the pre-contract negotiations which could amount to a collateral warranty; (2) per Bridge and Shaw L.JJ., the misrepresentation at the meeting of July 11, 1974, as to the deadweight capacity, was a most material matter and H Ltd had not proven that their marine manager had reasonable grounds for believing, and did believe, that the facts represented were true; (3) per Shaw and Bridge, L.J.J., H Ltd could not escape liability by reliance on the exception clause, since it was a provision which came within s.3 of the Act and was therefore of no effect unless the court allowed reliance upon it as being &#8220;fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the case&#8221; and since it was not &#8220;fair and reasonable&#8221; to allow reliance upon it, the cross-appeal should be dismissed.

The headlease granted to R contained a clause giving the head lessor the right to terminate the headleases for redevelopment. In negotiations for the underlease, G&#8217;s solicitors enquired whether there were any rights affecting the superior, leasehold title which would inhibit G&#8217;s enjoyment of the property. R&#8217;s solicitors answered &#8220;not to the lessor&#8217;s knowledge&#8221;.

The answer given to the enquiry was a misrepresentation by R upon which G had relied and G was entitled to damages. A defence that G had been contributorily negligent (by failing to call for the head lease) was open to R but, on the facts, did not succeed.</div></div> </div>

C sold a motor-car to N and accepted a cheque in part payment. The cheque was dishonoured the following morning, whereupon C asked both the police and the Automobile Association to trace the motor-car. N sold the car to M company, a firm of motor dealers, who had notice from which they could have inferred that N had acquired the car fraudulently. Immediately after acquiring the car, M filled up hire-purchase forms, selling the car to G and C, a finance company, in which M expressly warranted that the car belonged absolutely to themselves. Seventeen days after the transaction between C and N, C demanded the return of the car from M company, who claimed to have a good title to it.

A contract was concluded for the sale and purchase of development land. The contract incorporated the National Conditions of Sale (20th ed.). The property was sold subject to, inter alia, any easements, liabilities and public rights affecting it. This was subject to V&#8217;s duty to disclose all latent liabilities and easements known to it.

V replied to enquiries before contract stating that so far as it was aware there were no rights of easement or public rights affecting the property other than as disclosed in the contract. After completion a private foul sewer was discovered running under the property. P purported to rescind on the grounds of misrepresentation and common fundamental mistake.

Thus, the court had power under Sch.B1 para.63 to give directions to the administrators in respect of those funds even though they did not form part of the company&#8217;s assets, Denny v Yeldon [1995] 3 All E.R. 624 applied. Although para.63 did not specify the scope of the directions that might properly be given, the court was entitled to exercise its inherent equitable jurisdiction when seised of an application under that provision, MF Global UK Ltd (In Special Administration), Re [2013] EWHC 1655 (Ch), [2013] 1 W.L.R. 3874 applied (see paras 49-55 of judgment).</p><p>(2) Client money was received and held on the statutory trusts unless the firm was acting in accordance with CASS 5.4, the conditions for which were not fulfilled in the instant case. Moreover, there was nothing to suggest that deductions for commission, interest or any other matters should be made (paras 60, 64, 67). All clients with a client money entitlement were to be regarded as entitled to participate in the relevant pool, not merely those whose contributions were identifiable. Claims against the pool were not affected where the cover had been provided gratuitously, and any claims by intermediaries for fees or commission would be considered (paras 71, 73, 78).</p><p>(3) There was no reason why one statutory trust should not in principle be able to trace into the assets of another statutory trust where there had been a breach of trust. Although CASS statutory trusts had to be understood in terms of their own regulatory scheme and were not confined by the general law of trusts, that did not mean that victims of wrongs against the trust were deprived of an equitable remedy. Where the breach of trust had applied prior to pooling, the effect of successful tracing in support of a claim would be to augment the pool to the benefit of those who were beneficiaries of a statutory trust before pooling occurred (paras 118-119).</p><p>(4) If it became clear that poor record-keeping created a need for significant work to be done by the administrators to identify claimants, an application ought to be made to the court for directions and for prior sanction of remuneration. The words &#8220;costs properly attributable to the distribution of the client money&#8221; in CASS 5.3.2R meant the costs incurred for the purpose of enabling such distribution to be made and the costs of making such a distribution. Any work that might properly be done to enable the administrators to distribute the trust moneys was capable of being remunerated under that rule; therefore, there was no reason to have recourse to a general equitable jurisdiction. However, if it had been held that the rule related only to the costs of making the distribution, the jurisdiction under Berkeley Applegate (Investment Consultants) Ltd (No.1), Re [1989] Ch. 32 would have been available in respect of costs relating to preliminary work not covered by the rule. According to that jurisdiction, where the court was considering the enforcement of a claim to an equitable interest in property, it had a discretion to require that an allowance be made for costs incurred and for skill and labour expended in connection with the administration of that property, Berkeley Applegate considered (paras 139, 144-147).</p></div></div> </div>

The court also emphasised the duty on parties to assist the court in furthering the overriding objective, outlining the expected standards of compliance and co-operation between litigants and warning that opportunism and unreasonably contested applications for relief from sanctions would be penalised.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeals allowed.<p>(Jackson LJ concurring in the result but dissenting in part in the reasoning) (1) The text of r.3.9(1) contained three elements: identification of the &#8220;failure to comply&#8221;; consideration of &#8220;all the circumstances of the case&#8221;; and consideration of factors (a) and (b). The guidance given in paras 40 and 41 of Mitchell as to how that approach was to be applied in practice remained substantially sound, but it needed to be clarified and further explained. Some first instance judges had ignored the fact that it was necessary to consider all the circumstances of a case; others had adopted a more traditional approach of giving pre-eminence to the need to decide claims on their merits when there was no room for such an approach in the post-Jackson era. Useful amplification of the Mitchell guidance had already been given in some of the authorities immediately following the Mitchell decision, but some judges were being unduly draconian in their approaches, and others unduly relaxed. The view that an application for relief was bound to fail unless a default could be characterised as trivial, or unless there was a good reason for it, was leading to manifestly unjust decisions and was an approach which was not mandated by what the court said in Mitchell . The following clarification was intended to create a reasonably consistent judicial approach to the application of r.3.9, making it unnecessary to refer to earlier authorities in future, and assisting in reducing the need for satellite litigation. In future, judges were to adopt a three-stage approach: (a) they had to identify and assess the seriousness or significance of the relevant failure. Triviality was not part of that stage. There were clearly degrees of seriousness and significance. The assessment ought not to involve consideration of past unrelated failures, only the seriousness and significance of the very breach in respect of which relief from sanctions was sought. If a breach was not serious or significant, relief would usually be granted and there would be no need to spend much time on the second and third stages; (b) the second stage did not derive from r.3.9 but was nevertheless important: the court had to consider why the failure or default occurred. It would be inappropriate to produce an encyclopedia of good and bad reasons; paragraph 41 of Mitchell gave some examples but they were nothing more than that; (c) the third stage required the court to consider all the circumstances of the case. A serious breach for no reason was not automatically prevented from attracting relief. Factors (a) and (b) in r.3.9 remained of particular importance and were to be given particular weight at the third stage. Therefore, if the effect of a breach was to prevent the efficient and proportionate conduct of litigation, that would weigh against relief being granted. Likewise, the old lax culture of non-compliance with rules, practice directions and orders was no longer tolerated, and compliance had to be considered in every case. However, other relevant factors would also be relevant and would vary on a case-by-case basis (see paras 22-38, 81-82 of judgment). (2) Litigation could not be conducted efficiently and proportionately without fostering a culture of compliance and co-operation. CPR r.1.3 required parties to help the court to further the overriding objective and those who opportunistically and unreasonably opposed applications for relief from sanctions breached that obligation. Where the failure was neither serious nor significant, where a good reason was demonstrated, and where it was otherwise obvious that relief from sanctions should be granted, parties ought to agree that relief should be granted. In any event, extensions of time of up to 28 days ought readily to be given, as envisaged by r.3.8(4). Contested applications for relief ought to arise only in exceptional cases (paras 39-44). (3) The judges in each of the three appeals had erred in their case management powers and their orders were set aside.</p></div></div> </div>

Although the claimants had no personal liability to pay the solicitors&#8217; fees under the terms of the conditional fee agreement the solicitors had an interest which the insurer had notice of and the principle of equitable intervention operated to require the insurer to pay the solicitors&#8217; fees.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>(1) There was no reason in principle why implied, rather than express, notice of a lien should not be sufficient for the operation of the principle of equitable intervention. In any event, express notice had been given in the instant case. It was apparent from transcripts of telephone calls that the insurer had intended to avoid paying G&#8217;s costs by entering into a settlement directly with the clients. The insurer&#8217;s knowledge of and participation in the scheme established by the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents meant that it was well aware of G&#8217;s interest in receiving its fixed costs and other sums due under the scheme, Khans applied (see paras 25-26, 28-29 of judgment).</p><p>(2) There was a tension between the provisions in the CFAs. The provision in the client care letter had to prevail because it was expressed to be for the avoidance of doubt. That meant that G had no recourse against their clients for the fees and were limited to what they could recover from the losing side. In those circumstances, they would not have a lien over assets received in their clients&#8217; account because the clients had no underlying liability to them. However, under the normal course of events, G would have an entitlement to recover the fixed costs and other sums payable under the Protocol scheme. That was either an entitlement of the solicitors themselves or, alternatively, an entitlement to bring proceedings in the name of the clients to recover those sums. In either case, G had an interest which equity could protect and which was deserving of protection. The insurer was aware of that interest because of its knowledge of and participation in the Protocol scheme. That might involve an extension of the principle in Khans , but there was no reason why that principle should not apply in the circumstances of the case. The Protocol scheme was not mandatory and it was therefore open to the insurer to enter into compromise agreements with the claimants outside the Protocol. However, that was not what had happened. In each case, the client had authorised G to commence the Protocol process on his behalf and the insurer had voluntarily entered into the Protocol process. Neither the clients nor the insurer had formally exited the process before entering into the compromise agreements. The insurer had acted with the intention of defeating G&#8217;s entitlement under the scheme, Khans applied (paras 18, 30-32).</p><p>(3) The fact that an offer might have been made at a time when a retainer could still be cancelled could not relieve the insurer of liability. It would have been open to the insurer to make the offer conditional upon cancellation of G&#8217; retainer within the permitted period, but it did not do so. In each case, the insurer assumed the risk that its offer might be accepted after the expiry of the cancellation period. In any event, in none of the underlying cases was the retainer cancelled or otherwise terminated (paras 21, 34-37).</p><p>(4) The insurer entered into each compromise agreement with notice of G&#8217;s entitlement and the principle of equitable intervention required it to pay to G the sums payable on settlement under the Protocol scheme (para.38).</p></div></div> </div>

The car dealer was the agent of S in delivering the car to R but was acting without authority since its authority was to deliver to P. Further, there was no contract with R and no bailment of the car by S to R; (4) the purported signature on the hire purchase agreement was not P&#8217;s and that agreement therefore lacked an essential ingredient and was never an offer eligible for acceptance, and (5) according to Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Millett, in a case of mistaken identity, a person should be presumed to contract with the person with whom he was actually dealing.</div></div> </div>

The Act regulated the keeping of the register and imposed duties on the registrar for that purpose. The register published information which was available to the whole world, because it was available on the internet. The common law of negligence had control mechanisms designed to restrict the class of person who could claim damages for economic loss. However, the imposition of a statutory duty giving rise to a claim for damages at the suit of anyone who suffered economic loss by reason of any act or omission in breach of the statutory duty would create a very wide duty indeed. There was nothing in the Act to justify a finding that that was the intention of Parliament (see para.106 of judgment). (2) If a person did an act which was capable of causing harm to a particular person if done carelessly, he would have assumed responsibility to that person in respect of that task, White v Jones [1995] 2 A.C. 207 followed. In determining whether an assumption of responsibility and duty of care existed, the court took the following factors into account: (a) unless a remedy was provided by the common law of negligence, a company damaged by carelessness in these circumstances would have no remedy; (b) it was not difficult for the registrar&#8217;s staff to avoid errors of the instant type; (c) there were no public policy reasons for denying a duty of care; (d) the statutory duty or contractual relationship between the company and the registrar did not limit the nature and extent of the responsibility; (e) balancing the harm done to the company against the potential adverse impact on the registrar, it was clear that the balance favoured the loss falling on the registrar rather than the company; (f) it was likely that the imposition of a duty would improve the accuracy of the register, which was plainly in the public interest. It was fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care upon the registrar. A special relationship between the registrar and the company arose because it was foreseeable that if a company was wrongly said to be in liquidation, it would suffer serious harm. The nature of the exercise also supported the existence of such a relationship. The company was not consulted before an entry was made and had no opportunity to protest that the entry, if made, would be a mistake. Foreseeability and proximity had been established, Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman [1990] 2 A.C. 605, Ministry of Housing and Local Government v Sharp [1970] 2 Q.B. 223 and Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank Plc [2006] UKHL 28, [2007] 1 A.C. 181 followed. Accordingly, the registrar owed a duty of care when entering a winding-up order on the register to take reasonable care to ensure that the order was not registered against the wrong company. The duty was owed to any company which was not in liquidation but which was wrongly recorded on the register as having been wound up by order of the court. The duty extended to take reasonable care to enter the order on the record of the company named in the order, and not any other company. It did not extend to checking information supplied by third parties, but only to entering that information accurately on the register (paras 108-118). (3) The registrar&#8217;s error had been a disaster for the company. The rumour of insolvency spread and the suppliers&#8217; immediate reaction was to refuse further credit to the company. Prior to the error, the suppliers had been trading on ordinary 30-day credit terms, and actually affording longer periods of credit than that. The company&#8217;s main customer terminated the company&#8217;s contract because of its concerns about the company&#8217;s future, which were fuelled by rumours resulting from the error. The bank refused to lend further money to the company. The claimant had proved that the reason the company went into administration was the error made by the registrar (paras 37, 39, 47-48).</p></div></div> </div>

Whether any particular alterations come within this principle is a question of fact, but the inclusion of a garage in the demise has no material effect on the identity of the dwelling-house. Where there is a mutual mistake as to the effect of the structural alteration on the identity of the house, the Court, acting on the principle laid down in Cooper v Phibbs (1867) L.R. 2 H.L. 149 , will set aside a lease entered into under such a common misapprehension. The demised premises, a flat, had been let in 1939 at a standard rent of GBP 140 a year, and in repairing war-damage the landlord had made substantial alterations to the flat. Had the necessary notices been served, the increase in respect of improvements permitted under s.2(1) of the Act of 1920 would have brought the rent up to approximately GBP 250 a year, but the landlord and the tenant, who was a surveyor and a partner with the landlord in a firm of estate agents, were satisfied that the reconstructed flat was not subject to the previous standard rent of GBP 140 a year, and no notices were served. On completion of the work, the landlord let the flat, together with a garage which had not been previously demised, on a seven years&#8217; lease at GBP 250 a year. Subsequently, the tenant sought a declaration that the standard rent was GBP 140 a year and claimed repayment of the amount overpaid. Held, (1) disregarding the garage, which was not material to the question, the alterations were not such as to change the identity of the flat, and, since it was clear from the decision in Welch v Nagy [1950] 1 K.B. 455 , that no rule of estoppel could oust the jurisdiction of the court under the Acts, the tenant was not estopped by conduct, and the standard rent of GBP 140 a year applied; (2) (Jenkins, L.J., dissenting) there was a mutual mistake which was fundamental and in no way due to any fault of the landlord, so that in equity the landlord was entitled to have the lease set aside.

In its appeal, T, relying upon the test of mistake identified in Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd [1932] A.C. 161 reasserted that the contract had been concluded by reason of a fundamental mistake of fact which had deprived the contract of the consideration underlying it.

It was important to analyse the rights and obligations created by the contract before considering the effect of an alleged mistake. Bell indicated that equitable intervention such as that demonstrated in Cooper v Phibbs (1867) L.R. 2 H.L. 149 was permissible where the common law would have ruled the contract void for mistake and it was thought to be unlikely that the court in Bell had overlooked an equitable right to rescind an agreement in different circumstances. Whereas Bell was concerned with the question whether the mistake had the effect of producing a situation where the parties were only able to provide something essentially different from that which they had contracted to provide, Solle and the cases which followed it were more concerned with circumstances where the effect of the mistake made the contract a bad bargain for one of the parties. The two cases were irreconcilable and the only way to restore coherence to that area of the law was to declare that there was no jurisdiction to grant rescission of a contract on the ground of common mistake where the contract was valid and enforceable as far as the ordinary principles of contract law were concerned, Solle doubted and Bell applied. In the instant case, the contract between the parties was binding and upon cancellation of it, there was no injustice in the cancellation fee provided for in the contract becoming payable.

On this view, there is no need to consider what the parties thought, or how they or reasonable men in their shoes would have dealt with the new situation if they had foreseen it. The question is whether the contract which they did make is, on its true construction, wide enough to apply to the new situation: if it is not, then it is at an end.&#8221; Per Lord Radcliffe: &#8220;. . . frustration occurs whenever the law recognises that, without default of either party, a contractual obligation has become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract. Non haec in foedera veni. It was not this that I promised to do.&#8221; In 1946 the plaintiffs agreed to build 78 houses for the defendants. The contract price was GBP 85,836. The work was to be completed within eight months. Before the contract was signed the plaintiffs had written to the defendants: &#8220;Our tender is subject to adequate supplies of material and labour being available as and when required to carry out the work within the time specified.&#8221; Owing to bad weather, but more particularly to an unforeseen shortage of available labour, due to an unexpected lag in the demobilisation of troops after the war, the work took 22 months to complete. The contractors received the contract price, but they claimed that by reason of the delay they were entitled to treat the contract as void and to be paid on a quantum meruit. Lord Goddard C.J. held that on the wording of the contract the contractors were entitled to throw over the contract and sue on a quantum meruit basis. The Court of Appeal had remitted the case to the arbitrator for further findings. The appeal was heard after the arbitrator had made a supplemental award, when it was allowed on the grounds that (1) the condition in the letter meant that, if adequate supplies of material and labour should not be available when wanted, the contractors would be excused from completing the work within eight months but would be given a reasonable time; that the condition affected the time, but not the price; and that, so interpreted, the condition had been fully honoured; and that (2) when an owner employed a builder to do work for a fixed sum, his whole object was to secure himself against the unexpected difficulties which so often arose; and that the court could seriously damage the sanctity of contracts if it allowed a builder to charge more simply because, without anyone&#8217;s fault, the work took him much longer than he thought.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; on appeal to the House of Lords, (1) the letter merely formed part of the negotiations which led up to the contract and its terms were not incorporated into that contract; (2) in a contract of this kind the contractor undertook to do the work for a definite sum, and he took the risk of the cost being greater or less than he expected; if delay occurred through no one&#8217;s fault, that might be in the contemplation of the contract and there might be provision for extra time being given; to that extent the other party took the risk of delay; but he did not take the risk of the cost being increased by such delay; it might be that delay could be of a character so different from anything contemplated that the contract would be at an end, but in this case the most that could be said was that the delay was greater in degree than was to be expected; it was not caused by any new and unforeseeable factor or event; the job proved to be more onerous but it never became a job of a different kind from that contemplated in the contract; therefore the appeal must be dismissed.

The penalty rule regulated only the remedies available for breach of a party&#8217;s primary obligations, not the primary obligations themselves. That concept provided the whole basis of the classic distinction in law between a penalty and a genuine pre-estimate of loss, the former being essentially a way of punishing the contract-breaker rather than compensating the innocent party (see paras 11-13 of judgment). Clydebank Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding Co Ltd v Don Jose Ramos Yzquierdo y Castaneda [1905] A.C. 6 held that a contractual provision would be penal if it was &#8220;unconscionable and extravagant&#8221;. In Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage &amp; Motor Co Ltd [1915] A.C. 79, Lord Dunedin agreed that that was the essential question. Lord Atkinson considered that the question was the nature and extent of the innocent party&#8217;s interest in the performance of the relevant obligation. In determining whether a contractual provision was penal, the true test was whether it was a secondary obligation which imposed a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the primary obligation. The innocent party could have no proper interest in simply punishing the defaulter. His interest was in performance or in some appropriate alternative to performance. Compensation was not necessarily the only legitimate interest that the innocent party might have in the performance of the defaulter&#8217;s primary obligations, Clydebank , Dunlop , Lordsvale Finance Plc v Bank of Zambia [1996] Q.B. 752, United International Pictures v Cine Bes Filmcilik ve Yapimcilik AS [2003] EWCA Civ 1669, [2004] 1 C.L.C. 401, Murray v Leisureplay Plc [2005] EWCA Civ 963, [2005] I.R.L.R. 946 and White &amp; Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1962] A.C. 413 applied (paras 19-32). Although the penalty rule was open to criticism, it would not be appropriate for the instant court to abolish it or extend it (paras 36-43). (2) In Cavendish&#8217;s appeal, the first clause under consideration was, in reality, a price adjustment clause. It was a primary obligation, rather than a secondary provision. Although it had no relationship with the measure of loss attributable to the breach, Cavendish had a legitimate interest in the observance of the restrictive covenants which extended beyond the recovery of that loss. Viewed in the context of a carefully negotiated agreement between informed and legally advised parties at arm&#8217;s length, the clause could not be regarded as extravagant, exorbitant or unconscionable. It was not a penalty (paras 74-78, 175-181). The second clause, which contained a price formula for the sale of retained shares, was justified by the same legitimate interest. It was not a penalty, Jobson v Johnson [1989] 1 W.L.R. 1026 doubted (paras 79-88, 182-187). (3) In Beavis&#8217;s appeal, the parking charge had two main objectives: to manage the efficient use of parking space in the interests of the nearby retail outlets and of their customers, and to provide an income stream to enable ParkingEye to meet the costs of operating the scheme and make a profit. Those objectives were perfectly reasonable. The charge was not a penalty: ParkingEye had a legitimate interest in charging overstaying motorists which extended beyond the recovery of any loss. There was no reason to suppose that £85 was out of all proportion to ParkingEye&#8217;s interests. Motorists regularly used the car park knowing of the charge, which was some evidence of its reasonableness. They clearly regarded the risk of having to pay £85 for overstaying as an acceptable price to pay for the convenience of parking there. The fact that some customers underestimated or overlooked the time required or taken for shopping, or whatever else they were doing, did not make the scheme excessive or unconscionable (paras 97-101, 198). The parking charge did not infringe the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. A reasonable motorist in Beavis&#8217;s position would have agreed to the term imposing the charge in individual contract negotiations, Aziz v Caixa d&#8217;Estalvis de Catalunya, Tarragona i Manresa (Catalunyacaixa) (C-415/11) [2013] 3 C.M.L.R. 5 applied (paras 102-114, 200-213). (4) (Per Lord Mance) The courts below had found some support in the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 for the view that charges like the parking charge in Beavis&#8217;s case were not to be regarded as unenforceable. That was a misreading of the Act. The reference in Sch.4 para.1 to a relevant &#8220;obligation&#8221; did not exclude the penalty doctrine. On the contrary, if a contractually-stipulated charge was a penalty, there would be no obligation (para.191). (Per Lord Toulson) The penalty clause made no allowance for circumstances, allowed no period of grace and provided no room for adjustment. ParkingEye had failed to show factual grounds on which it could reasonably assume that a customer using the car park would have agreed, in individual negotiations, to pay £85 if he overstayed for even one minute, Aziz considered (paras 306-314).</p></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-552'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Damages - Delay - Profits - Remoteness</div><div class='details details-facts'><p>Remoteness; loss of profit arising from delay in delivery</p><p>In considering the authorities on remoteness of damage the following general propositions emerge: (1) It is well settled that the governing purpose of damages is to put the party whose rights have been violated in the same position, so far as money can do so, as if his rights had been observed. This purpose, if relentlessly pursued, would provide him with a complete indemnity for all losses de facto resulting from a particular breach, however improbable, however unpredictable. This, in contract at least, is recognised as too harsh a rule; (2) in cases of breach of contract the aggrieved party is only entitled to recover such part of the loss actually resulting as was at the time of the contract reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach; (3) what was at that time reasonably foreseeable depends on the knowledge then possessed by the parties, or, at all events, by the party who later commits the breach; (4) for this purpose, knowledge &#8220;possessed&#8221; is of two kinds - one imputed, the other actual. Everyone, as a reasonable person, is taken to know the &#8220;ordinary course of things&#8221; and, consequently, what loss is liable to result from a breach of that ordinary course. This is the subject-matter of the &#8220;first rule&#8221; in, Hadley v Baxendale 156 E.R. 145 , but to this knowledge, which a contract-breaker is assumed to possess, whether he actually possesses it or not, there may have to be added in a particular case knowledge which he actually possesses of special circumstances outside the &#8220;ordinary course of things&#8221; of such a kind that a breach in those special circumstances would be liable to cause more loss. Such a case attracts the operation of the &#8220;second rule&#8221; so as to make additional loss also recoverable; (5) in order to make the contract-breaker liable under either rule, it is not necessary that he should actually have asked himself what loss is liable to result from a breach. It suffices that, if he had considered the question, he would, as a reasonable man, have concluded that the loss in question was liable to result, and (6) nor, finally, to make a particular loss recoverable, need it be proved that on a given state of knowledge the defendant could, as a reasonable man, foresee that a breach must necessarily result in that loss. It is enough if he could foresee it was likely to result. It is enough - to borrow from the language of Lord du Parcq in Monarch Steamship Co v A/B Karlshamns Oljefabriker [1947-51] C.L.Y. 2562 if the loss (or some factor without which it would not have occurred) is a &#8220;serious possibility&#8221; or a &#8220;real danger&#8221;. (Perhaps the colloquialism &#8220;on the cards&#8221; indicates the shade of meaning with greater accuracy than &#8220;likely&#8221; to result.) Applying these general principles to a case where the plaintiffs, a laundry company, claimed damages from the defendants, an engineering company, for delay in supplying a boiler, which - so the defendants had been informed - was to &#8220;be put into use in the shortest possible space of time&#8221;, it was held that the obvious purpose for which a boiler in a business such as the plaintiff company&#8217;s was to be used leapt to the eye, and that no supplier, let alone an engineering company which had promised delivery of such an article by a particular date, with knowledge that it was to be put into use immediately on delivery, could reasonably contend that it could not foresee that loss of profit or loss of business would be liable to result to the purchaser from a long delay in delivery thereof, with the consequence that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages for loss of profits resulting from the enforced delay in extending their business, Monarch Steamship Co v A/B Karlshamns Oljefabriker[1947-51] C.L.Y. 2562 ; Hadley v Baxendale 156 E.R. 145 , British Columbia Saw Mill Co Ltd v Nettleship (1867-68) L.R. 3 C.P. 499 distinguished; and Portman v Middleton 140 E.R. 1108 distinguished.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The appellant shipowner entered into a charterparty with the respondents, who were merchants. Under the terms of the charterparty the ship was to be loaded with sugar at Constanza on or after October 27, 1960, and was to proceed therefrom with all convenient speed to Basrah. In fact the ship called at several ports en route to Basrah thus taking some nine days longer to arrive than it would have done had it sailed directly to Basrah. The price of sugar at Basrah fell during those nine days, and in the result the respondents&#8217; sugar was sold for GBP 4,183 16s. 8d. less than it would have been had it arrived promptly. Disputes having arisen an umpire found as facts, inter alia, (a) that sugar was regularly bought and sold at Basrah, which fact was known to the appellant; (b) that the price of sugar there fluctuated from time to time; (c) that shipowners generally knew that there was some urgency in carrying sugar, a perishable commodity, to its destination; and (d) that the appellant did not know that the respondents intended to sell the sugar promptly on arrival. The appellant admitted that the delay was in breach of the charterparty. As to the measure of damages, held (1) that on the facts the appellant ought to have foreseen that delay would involve a serious possibility of a real danger that the price of sugar would decline; and (2) that the proper damages were therefore GBP 4,183 16s. 8d., the difference between the price which the sugar ought to have fetched if it had arrived on time and the price which it in fact fetched. (The &#8220;serious possibility of real danger,&#8221; per Lords Upjohn and Pearce, was expressed in differing terms by Lords Reid, Morris of Borth-y-Gest, and Hodson.)

The common basis on which the parties had contracted was essential to the rule in Hadley v Baxendale as a whole. In Koufos v C Czarnikow Ltd (The Heron II) [1969] 1 A.C. 350 their Lordships had had well in mind that it was not simply a question of probability but also of what the contracting parties had to be taken to have had in mind, having regard to the nature and object of their business transaction. What mattered was whether the common intention of reasonable parties to a charterparty of this sort would have been that, in the event of a relatively short delay in redelivery, an extraordinary loss, measured over the whole term of the renewed fixture, was, in the words of Lord Reid in The Heron II , &#8220;sufficiently likely to result from the breach of contract to make it proper to hold that the loss flowed naturally from the breach or that loss of that kind should have been within [the defaulting party&#8217;s] contemplation&#8221;. That would not have been the common intention of reasonable contracting parties. It was contrary to the principle stated in Victoria Laundry (Windsor) v Newman Industries [1949] 2 K.B. 528, and reaffirmed in The Heron II , to suppose that the parties were contracting on the basis that T would be liable for any loss, however large, occasioned by a delay in redelivery in circumstances where it had no knowledge of, or control over, the new fixture entered into by M, Hadley v Baxendale , The Heron II and Victoria Laundry applied.</p></div></div> </div>
