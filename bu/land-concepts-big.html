Unregistered interests which overrode registered dispositions had to be proprietary in nature, and the combined effect of s.116 and s.132 was that s.116 rights had to have a proprietary element in order to have any effect. S also relied on the line of authority to the effect that following the exchange of contracts, a seller held the property on trust for the purchaser. On the face of it, N&#8217;s promise bore the hallmarks of a proprietary estoppel, but the question was whether such an estoppel could be an interest in land before the promisor became the owner. Between exchange and completion the purchaser had a proprietary interest &#8220;of a sort&#8221;, Oughtred v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1960] A.C. 206 and Berkley v Poulett [1977] 1 E.G.L.R. 86 considered. The question was whether the conveyance and the mortgage were one indivisible transaction, or whether there was a moment between the completion of the purchase and the grant of the mortgage in which the purchaser acquired legal estate before disposing of it by way of mortgage, Coventry Permanent Economic Building Society v Jones [1951] 1 All E.R. 901, Church of England Building Society v Piskor [1954] Ch. 553, Universal Permanent Building Society v Cooke [1952] Ch. 95 and Woolwich Equitable Building Society v Marshall [1952] Ch. 1 considered. Cann decided that the conveyance and the mortgage were indivisible but, in any event, each of the above cases assumed that even if the tenant had equitable rights as against the purchaser, those rights would only become proprietary and capable of taking priority over a mortgage when they were &#8220;fed&#8221; by the purchaser&#8217;s acquisition of the legal estate, Cann applied. S&#8217;s appeal had therefore to be dismissed on the ground that she acquired merely personal rights against N when she agreed to sell on the basis of its promise. Her rights only became proprietary and capable of taking priority over the mortgage when N acquired the legal estate on completion, at which point the acquisition of the legal estate and the grant of the charge were one indivisible transaction (see paras 24, 36, 56-80, 105-114 of judgment). (2) (Obiter) (Per Lords Collins and Sumption JJ.S.C.) Given the conclusion on the first issue, the second, whether the contract for sale was part of an indivisible transaction together with the conveyance and the mortgage, did not arise and was unlikely ever to arise. Nevertheless, the court would express its views on it. It was implicit in Cann that the contract, transfer and mortgage were one indivisible transaction, Nationwide Anglia Building Society v Ahmed and Balakrishnan (1995) 70 P. &amp; C.R. 381 considered. In the instant case the contract and conveyance had been executed on the same day, but the analysis was not dependant on that. It would be unrealistic to treat the contract of sale as a divisible element. Even if S had equitable rights of a proprietary nature arising on exchange, the mortgage would still have taken priority (paras 84-85, 90). (Per Lady Hale J.S.C and Lords Wilson and Reed JJ.S.C.) The mortgagee was not a party to the contract between the vendor and purchaser. It was difficult to see how the House of Lords rejection of Piskor in Cann implied that the contract of sale was part of the indivisible transaction along with the conveyance and mortgage (paras 115-123).</p></div></div> </div>

That was a question of fact, Grossman v Hooper [2001] EWCA Civ 615, [2001] 3 F.C.R. 662 applied. The answer might be that the disputed term was not a term of the relevant sale but was part of a strictly unrelated transaction. The problem in the instant case was that the works obligation sued upon was an oral one, North Eastern Properties Ltd v Coleman &amp; Quinn Conveyancing [2010] EWCA Civ 277, [2010] 1 W.L.R. 2715 considered. When the parties reached an agreement to vary the sale agreement, their agreement had to be contained in a document satisfying s.2. That was because by agreeing to vary the contract, they were in effect entering into a new contract, and could only validly do so if it was made in a written and signed document containing all the expressly agreed terms of the original agreement. The supplemental agreement purported to comply with s.2, but the critical question was whether it needed to also incorporate the works obligation on the basis that it was an expressly agreed term of the variation of the sale agreement. On the limited material before the court it was not possible to decide the point finally one way or the other. The judge had been correct to decline to do so, and had not erred by deferring its determination to the trial (see paras 27-33 of judgment). (2) In Kilcarne Holdings Ltd v Targetfollow (Birmingham) Ltd [2004] EWHC 2547 (Ch), [2005] 2 P. &amp; C.R. 8 Lewison J. deduced from Tootal Clothing Ltd v Guinea Properties Management Ltd (1992) 64 P. &amp; C.R. 452 a principle to the effect that, in a case in which the parties had purportedly made a s.2 contract but had in fact created a nullity because not all the terms of the sale were included within it, once the land elements of the purported contract had been completed, either side could then enforce any non-land terms that were or should have been included in it, even though, by reason of the non-compliance with s.2, they had no contractual force. The court respectfully disagreed with that summary of Tootal , Kilcarne doubted. Whilst Tootal was a difficult case, it was not authority for any such proposition, and the proposition that a void contract could, by acts in the nature of part performance, mature into a valid one was contrary to principle and wrong. There was nothing in Tootal to support K&#8217;s submission that once the land elements of the sale agreement had been completed it was open to them to sue M for the alleged breach of the works obligation which should have been included in the supplemental agreement, Tootal explained. M&#8217;s appeal on the Tootal point was therefore allowed (paras 36, 40-48).</p></div></div> </div>

In October 1977, Bleak House was purchased for GBP 34,000. Mr. and Mrs. Flegg provided GBP 18,000 of the purchase price. The remainder was provided by their son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell-Brown. It was necessary for the M-Bs to mortgage the house to the Hastings and Thanet Building Society to raise their contribution. In consequence, the house was transferred to Mr. and Mrs. M-B upon trust for sale as joint tenants. The house was in fact held by Mr. and Mrs. M-B on trust for sale and to stand possessed of the net proceeds of sale and rents and profits until sale upon trust for Mr. and Mrs. M-B and Mr. and Mrs. F as tenants in common in the proportions which they had contributed to the purchase price. From that time, Mr. and Mrs. M-B and Mr. and Mrs. F occupied the property in common. In January 1982, Mr. and Mrs. M-B executed a charge of the house in favour of the City of London Building Society to secure a loan of GBP 37,500. Mr. and Mrs. M-B used the money to discharge the existing mortgage and a number of other charges. Mr. and Mrs. M-B defaulted and the Building Society sought an order for possession of the house which was granted at first instance. On Mr. and Mrs. F&#8217;s appeal, the Court of Appeal held applying Williams &amp; Glyn&#8217;s Bank Ltd v Boland [1981] A.C. 487 , that Mr. and Mrs. F had an overriding interest in the house so that the Building Society&#8217;s charge was subject to their interest.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the Building Society&#8217;s appeal, that Mr. and Mrs. F&#8217;s interest was that of a beneficiary under a trust for sale. The advancement of capital moneys by the Building Society to Mr. and Mrs. M-B, being an advancement to two trustees, overreached Mr. and Mrs. F&#8217;s interest. Their interest transferred to the capital moneys in the hands of Mr. and Mrs. M-B and the equity of redemption. The enjoyment of occupation of the property did not give rise to any separate or severable right from those enjoyed under the trust for sale. the Law of Property Act 1925 S.14 could not enlarge or add to Mr. and Mrs. F&#8217;s interest; it could not create an interest in the nature of a right to occupy the property that survived the execution of the trust for sale. Upon the execution of the trust for sale, any rights in reference to the house ceased to subsist within the meaning of the Land Registration Act 1925 s.70(1)(g) ; there was no longer a right for the time being subsisting. Accordingly, there was nothing in s.70(1)(g) that had the effect of preserving any rights of Mr. and Mrs. F to occupy the house against the Building Society&#8217;s. In Williams and Glyn&#8217;s Bank v Boland, the beneficiary&#8217;s rights were not overreached because payment was not made to two trustees as required by s.27 Law of Property Act 1925. The same did not apply in the present case ( Williams &amp; Glyn&#8217;s Bank Ltd v Boland [1981] A.C. 487 distinguished; Bull v Bull [1955] 1 Q.B. 234 , National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth [1965] A.C. 1175 , Irani Finance Ltd v Singh [1971] Ch. 59 considered).</div></div> </div>

A legal charge was a public document on a public register upon which third parties could be expected to rely in order to obtain an accurate picture of the state of the title to the land.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>(Arden L.J. dissenting) (1) Under the principles of interpretation, the existence and terms of the facility agreement were admissible evidence, Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society (No.1) [1998] 1 W.L.R. 896 followed. However, the extent to which that evidence could influence the interpretation of the charge was constrained by the fact that the land was registered. The land register was intended to be a complete and accurate reflection of the state of the title to registered land. Anybody applying to inspect the register would be supplied with the documents kept by the registrar. The facility agreement was not one of those documents, and to treat it as modifying the registered charge would fall foul of s.120(2)(b), under which the documents kept by the registrar were to be taken as containing all the material parts of the original documents. The courts distinguished between the use of background material in the interpretation of ordinary commercial contracts on the one hand, and its use in interpreting registrable contracts and public documents on the other. A more restrictive approach was to be taken in respect of the latter. Even though the system of land registration did not mean that registered title was wholly indefeasible, a person inspecting the register could not, in general, be expected to look further for extrinsic material, Westfield Management Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd [2007] HCA 45 considered. When considering the extent to which background material not appearing on the face of the charge could influence the interpretation of that charge, the question was what weight would be attributed to it by a reasonable person with all the background knowledge of the parties Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd [2009] UKPC 10, [2009] 1 W.L.R. 1988 considered. In the instant case, the reasonable reader&#8217;s background knowledge would include the knowledge that the charge would be registered on a publicly accessible register upon which third parties might be expected to rely. He would know that documents retained by the registrar were to be taken as containing all material terms, and he would understand that the parties had a choice about what they put into the public domain and what they kept private. He would conclude that matters which the parties had chosen to keep private should not influence those parts of the bargain that they had chosen to make public. There was a real difference between allowing the physical features of the land to influence the interpretation of a transfer, and allowing the terms of a collateral document to do so. Even the staunchest advocates of the court&#8217;s ability to consider extrinsic evidence stopped short of saying that, by the process of interpretation, the court could insert whole clauses that the parties had mistakenly failed to include (see paras 104-105, 108-109, 123-132, 148-150 of judgment). The decision in Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38, [2009] 1 A.C. 1101 did not abolish the remedy of rectification, and the instant case demonstrated that it still had a useful role, if properly pleaded, Chartbrook considered. In the context of a charge intended to be completed by registration at the land registry, the insertion of a missing clause ought to be effected, if at all, by way of a properly pleaded and proved claim for rectification. C had neither pleaded such a claim nor attempted to prove one, and its case should not have been decided summarily as a pure question of interpretation. To interpret the registered charge as including the extended power of sale contained in the facility agreement was a step too far (paras 97-99, 136-138).</p></div></div> </div>

The proprietors had not caused or contributed to the mistaken registration as they held an honest and reasonable belief in their ownership, and it was not unjust to leave the registration of the fell in their names where they had expended time and money in improving and managing it and no-one else had claimed ownership.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>(1) The deputy adjudicator had not been required to decide who was entitled to the fell. The Crown had not asserted title and was not a party. It had not disclaimed ownership but was content to be bound by the decision. In those circumstances, W could not complain that it had been wrong not to have accorded Crown title significant weight in determining the injustice point under Sch.4 para.6 of the Act (see paras 92-93 of judgment). (2) W&#8217;s argument, that the mistaken registration of the fell was consequential on the mistaken registration of the lordship, was logical. However, Sch.4 para.6(2) required the court to take specified factors into account where there was a registered proprietor in possession of the land. That was not the case with the correction of the lordship registration, because it was not &#8220;land&#8221; but an incorporeal hereditament. The consequential nature of the mistaken registration of the fell did not result in the disapplication of Sch.4 para.6(2) (para.95). (3) It was a question of fact for the deputy adjudicator as to whether there had been a lack of care contributing to the mistaken registration of the fell. He had been entitled to reach his conclusion because: (a) the burden of showing lack of care had been on W; (b) B had behaved reasonably and responsibly in engaging solicitors to advise and act for them. B&#8217;s belief had been reasonable having regard to what was known about title to the lordship; (c) it was a fatal flaw that the lack of care point had not been raised in relation to the registration of the fell, as distinct from the registration of the lordship. It had only been raised after the evidence was closed and B had no opportunity to deal with it in their evidence (paras 96-99). (4) There had been no error of law in the deputy adjudicator&#8217;s conclusion on the injustice point. The following factors were relevant: (a) W had not claimed title to the fell and the Crown had shown no sign of asserting title against B. It was therefore a relevant factor that the fell should be owned by someone rather than being left in continuing uncertainty about title to it; (b) in view of the Crown&#8217;s stance it would have made no difference had the Crown been notified of B&#8217;s application for registration; (c) W had delayed bringing the application for rectification; (d) B had invested time, effort and money on the management and improvement of the fell and had entered into commitments on which they and others relied; (e) the fact that the mistake as to registration of the fell had been consequential on the registration of the lordship, which had been corrected, did not mean that it also had to be corrected or that it would be unjust not to correct it (paras 100, 102-106).</p></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-83'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Real Property - Land Registers - Land Registration - Mistake - Priorities - Rectification - Title to Land</div><div class='details details-facts'><p>The court considered the power in the Land Registration Act 2002 Sch.4 to &#8220;correct&#8221; mistakes in the land register. It gave particular focus to the rectification provisions in Sch.4 para.8 in the context of changes to the priority of competing rights, explaining how the words &#8220;for the future&#8221; should be construed.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>(1) The judge had been entitled to order that J&#8217;s title numbers should take priority. J&#8217;s and G&#8217;s leases fell within the subject matter of Sch.4 para.8. The primary effect of that provision was to confirm that the power to rectify the register was not limited to simply restoring an interest, but extended to changing what would otherwise be its priority. The words &#8220;for the future&#8221; qualified that power; the question was how those words fell to be interpreted. G&#8217;s argument was that if its interest was registered after the mistake but before the rectification, and would otherwise enjoy priority, that priority could not be altered, because an alteration to a priority which already existed could not be described as an alteration &#8220;for the future&#8221;. That construction would defeat the situation that Sch.4 para.8 was intended to address. Schedule 4 was concerned with &#8220;correcting&#8221; mistakes in the register and it was established law that the power to correct extended to correcting the consequences of such mistakes. Under para.3(3), that power was, in some circumstances, also a duty. An interest having priority meant that an owner could exercise his rights to the exclusion of any inconsistent rights of the owner of the competing interest. Thus, the concept of priority arose as soon as a party sought to enjoy those rights. The words &#8220;for the future&#8221; therefore meant that the person whose interest had been restored to the register could exercise his rights as the owner of that interest, to the exclusion of the rights of the owner of the competing interest, from the moment that the order was made. The effect of the judge&#8217;s order was to enable J to immediately exercise their rights as leaseholders to the exclusion of G, Argyle Building Society v Hammond (1985) 49 P. &amp; C.R. 148 applied, Knights Construction (March) Ltd v Roberto Mac Ltd [2011] 2 E.G.L.R. 123 approved, and Piper Trust Ltd v Caruso (UK) Ltd and DB UK Bank Ltd v Santander UK Plc considered. The court drew attention to the contrary reasoning advanced in Ruoff &amp; Roper: Registered Conveyancing (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell) and Dr Charles Harpum, Stuart Bridge, Dr Martin Dixon, Megarry &amp; Wade: The Law of Real Property, 8th edn (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2012) concerning the interpretation of Sch.4 para.8, Freer v Unwins Ltd [1976] Ch. 288 and Malory Enterprises Ltd v Cheshire Homes (UK) Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 151, [2002] Ch. 216 considered (see paras 20, 32-33, 35-42, 47-52, 54-56, 77, 79-83, 86-99 of judgment). (2) The judge had been right to find that there were no exceptional circumstances justifying non-rectification of the register. Delay by J in claiming rectification did not amount to an exceptional circumstance justifying the court not making an order which it would otherwise be obliged to make (paras 101, 104).</p></div></div> </div>

The claim was not defeated by the fact that the occupier of the relevant property had always had an overriding interest in the form of a right to have the forged disposition set aside.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>S&#8217;s claim turned on the interaction between Sch.8 para.1(1)(a) and para.1(2)(b). The registrar contended that alteration of the register did not amount to rectification within para.1(1)(a) because it had not prejudicially affected S&#8217;s title to the registered charge so as to cause loss: the registration had always been subject to R&#8217;s right to have the forged disposition set aside, which was an overriding interest binding on S&#8217;s registered title. S relied on para.1(2)(b), under which, it said, the proprietor of a registered charge claiming in good faith under a forged disposition was deemed to have suffered loss (see paras 14-15 of judgment). The Land Registration Act 1925 s.83(4) largely contained the provisions now found in para.1(2)(b). However, the 2002 definition of rectification introduced the requirement to show that the registered title had been &#8220;prejudicially affected&#8221;. Chowood&#8217;s Registered Land, Re [1933] Ch. 574, held that no &#8220;loss&#8221; was suffered under s.83 where the register was rectified to give effect to an overriding interest. Accordingly, S accepted that it could not establish loss and prejudice unless either R&#8217;s right to set aside the charge was not an overriding interest, or loss was established under the deeming provisions in para.1(2)(b). Before 2002, it would have been necessary to consider whether s.83(4) created an exception to Chowood where the registered title was a forged disposition. Section 83(4) was designed to exclude the argument that rectification to remove a forged disposition caused no loss to the registered proprietor. The Law Commission&#8217;s proposals leading to the 2002 Act showed that it had intended prejudicial effect under the 2002 Act to be limited to cases where alteration of the title would have been held to cause &#8220;loss&#8221; under s.83(1)(a), and that the reference, in the definition of rectification in Sch.8 para.11, to alteration of the register which prejudicially affected the registered title was intended to give effect to Chowood . That left open the question of how Chowood operated in cases involving forged dispositions. The Law Commission&#8217;s proposals showed that it had regarded para.1(2)(b)&#8216;s objective as being to reproduce s.83(4) on the basis that the registered proprietor under a forged disposition acting in good faith would be treated as suffering loss from rectification. The unqualified application of Chowood , absent para.1(2)(b), was likely in most cases to completely answer any allegation of prejudice. The judge had rejected the registrar&#8217;s submission that para.1(2)(b) only applied once it was determined that alteration to the register amounted to rectification. That argument faced difficulty regarding the effect of para.1(2)(b) if Chowood applied in priority to the presumption of loss. Malory Enterprises Ltd v Cheshire Homes (UK) Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 151, [2002] Ch. 216 decided that the fraudulent transfer of land only transferred the legal estate on registration, leaving the original proprietor with a beneficial interest. If that was correct, no alteration by removal of the new entry would constitute prejudice for the purposes of rectification under the 2002 Act; the transferee would never receive more than the bare legal estate and could not suffer loss by alteration of the register, regardless of whether the right of rectification was an overriding interest. However, the beneficial ownership point in Malory had been decided per incuriam. It did not consider Argyle Building Society v Hammond (1985) 49 P. &amp; C.R. 148, which stated that s.69(1) of the 1925 Act vested title by registration even when the transfer was a forgery, or consider s.114, which contradicted its reasoning, Hammond considered, Malory not followed (paras 19-45). The registrar had submitted that the limitation of what constituted rectification under the 2002 Act to cases of prejudice in the sense of loss made it impossible to regard para.1(2)(b) as intended to neutralise Chowood . The phrase &#8220;where the register is rectified&#8221; in para.1(2)(b) did not compel the conclusion that the existence of an overriding interest ousted the right to rectification. The differing origins of Chowood and the statutory provisions did not mean the provisions did not apply where the overriding interest consisted of a right to seek rectification on the ground that the disposition was forged. That such a right was capable of being an overriding interest did not alter the fact that the registered proprietor was claiming in good faith and was to be regarded as suffering loss by rectification as if the disposition had not been forged. Applying Chowood in the instant case led to the conclusion that there had been no loss, which contradicted the presumption under para.1(2)(b). If the 2002 or 1925 Acts had intended the deemed loss provisions to provide an exception for cases involving enforcement of an overriding interest, much clearer indication would have been necessary, Chowood considered (paras 47-51).</p></div></div> </div>

There had been a mutual understanding between T and F that if F built an extension it would belong to her. T had failed to establish that F had not acted in reliance on that representation, and F established her claim to ownership of the extension. (2) Unacceptable conduct amounting to undue influence might arise out of a relationship between two persons where one had acquired over the other a measure of influence or ascendancy, of which the ascendant person took unfair advantage. Whether a transaction had been brought about by undue influence was a question of fact, Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge (No.2) [2001] UKHL 44, [2002] 2 A.C. 773 applied. On the evidence, there had not been a complete relationship of trust and confidence between T and F, as T had appreciated that she was taking a risk, although F had promised to pay T the £200,000. The kind of trust in play was no more than a trust that a daughter would keep her promise to her mother. No presumption of undue influence arose, therefore, and the burden was on T to prove that F had actually used undue influence to procure that the transaction went ahead. The fact that F&#8217;s promise had been repeatedly and sincerely given did not amount to undue influence. Accordingly, the claim to set aside the deed of family arrangement and the gift of the legal title had to fail. (3) Even if, contrary to that finding, T had been entitled to set aside the transaction on the ground of undue influence, that would not have affected the registered estate at the date of the charge in favour of X because the claim based on undue influence would not crystallise until F&#8217;s misappropriation of the mortgage moneys and the equity would not arise until that time. (4) F had not repaid the £20,000 that T had lent to her and it was still owing.</p></div></div> </div>

Because that clearly cut across the underlying premise of the land-registration system that purchasers should acquire good title free of any interests which did not appear on the register, subject to statutorily defined overriding interests, the circumstances in which a constructive trust would arise had been narrowly confined. The crucial question was whether the transferee of the land had undertaken a new obligation to give effect to the relevant encumbrance or prior interest, Lloyd v Dugdale [2001] EWCA Civ 1754, [2002] 2 P. &amp; C.R. 13 followed. Although G accepted that it had knowledge or notice of H&#8217;s rights as contained in the agreement between him and C, it had not assumed an obligation to re-transfer the Phase Two Residential Land to him under the sale agreement which it had entered into with C. The effect of one clause in that agreement was that, for the purposes of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994, C sold with full title guarantee free of all rights created by it, which would clearly include H&#8217;s right to a re-transfer. Another clause provided that the property was sold subject to the entries on the property and charges registers and to certain other matters, none of which included H&#8217;s rights. Further, there was no specific reference in the agreement to H&#8217;s right to a re-transfer of the Phase Two Residential Land.

A registration obtained by a person not entitled to apply for it would be mistaken, so putting the register back in the condition it was prior to that application would be correction of a mistake within the meaning of Sch.4 para.1 and para.5. There was no reason to limit the jurisdiction to correct a mistake to official errors in the course of examination of a relevant application. To otherwise conclude would be an invitation to fraud. The fact that there was no possibility of extending the prescribed time meant that Parliament either intended that the rectification power could cover such a case or that the true owner could lose his land for failure to submit a form in time, a conclusion which was wholly improbable (see paras 24-26, 30 of judgment). The normal operation of the provisions would lead to certainty and simplicity and there was no answer to the fact that if landowners could lose land in such a way they would have lost it without compensation, with a consequential breach of the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 Protocol 1 art.1 (para.34). (2) It was impossible to draw any rational distinction between a mistake induced by fraud and a mistake induced by a wrong application. In both scenarios the reason for the mistake was the same, namely the fact that the registrar had been given false information. As the judge had noted, it would be strange if a registered proprietor could be at risk of losing his land to a squatter who had never been in adverse possession (paras 28-29). (3) The legal onus of proof lay on M. Having shown, prima facie, that B&#8217;s claim to have been in exclusive possession for upwards of 10 years was wrong, the evidential burden shifted to B and B had failed to prove that he had been in adverse possession. In any event, the adjudicator&#8217;s findings did not turn on the issue of onus of proof but rather came as the result of having heard all the evidence (paras 38-89). (4) As the judge had found, it was a matter of &#8220;simple justice&#8221; to put M back as the registered owner. B had made an unjustified attempt to acquire title (para.41).</p></div></div> </div>

However, in order to demonstrate that L gave permission his words and acts had to be probative of, and not merely consistent with, the giving of permission.

Z did not retake exclusive possession of the strip as they intended to do by banging in posts and starting to erect a fence. They decided to withdraw part-way through that exercise, because of the protests from P. It was clear that Z intended that they should recover possession, but they did not retake possession in any meaningful sense. It was not enough that Z planted stakes or took other steps symbolic of taking possession of the whole of the strip. The judge was entitled to come to the conclusion that P&#8217;s adverse possession had not been interrupted (paras 35-44).

By the time Z asserted their ownership C and P together had been in possession of the land for well over 10 years. A surveyor&#8217;s report commissioned by the parties found that the boundary was in the middle of the hedge.

On the basis of the judge&#8217;s findings, there was nothing which would have put C on notice of the need to make enquiries, of his solicitors or of others, as to whether his title included the disputed land that he had enjoyed from when he had first acquired his interest (see paras 27-28 of judgment). (2) The mere fact that the paper title owner challenged asserted ownership by adverse possession was not always sufficient to make the adverse possessor&#8217;s belief unreasonable, Zarb v Parry [2011] EWCA Civ 1306, [2012] 1 W.L.R. 1240 applied. The question in each case was what, in all the circumstances, was the proper conclusion on reasonableness of belief. By the time C had received G&#8217;s letters, he had been enjoying unchallenged, exclusive occupation for 18 years. Accordingly, the judge was entitled and correct to conclude that the correspondence did not mean that C&#8217;s belief in ownership ceased to be reasonable (paras 29-30).</p></div></div> </div>

The criminalisation of squatting did not mean that granting title to a squatter in such circumstances amounted to him benefiting from his criminal conduct.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>It was an established principle that the law of illegality did not give the court a discretion to take a claimant&#8217;s illegal actions into account when deciding the extent to which such illegality impacted the relief sought by the claimant. Rather, the court had to identify in the specific context a particular rule which appropriately reflected the relevant underlying policy, Tinsley v Milligan [1994] 1 A.C. 340 and Allen v Hounga [2014] UKSC 47, [2014] 1 W.L.R. 2889 applied. There was no single rule with blanket effect across all areas of law. In the instant case, the illegality affected statutory rights, and the registrar&#8217;s argument would involve &#8220;reading down&#8221; Sch.6 para.1 of the 2002 Act so as to provide that a period of adverse possession in reliance on behaviour which constituted a criminal offence could not qualify to be treated as adverse possession. Balancing the public policy considerations in the 2002 Act with those in the 2012 Act, it was clear that Parliament had not intended s.144 of the latter to impact Sch.6 of the former. Section 144 was designed to provide deterrence and practical assistance for homeowners in removing squatters from their properties; it was not to re-balance the rights of property owners and adverse possessors regarding their respective entitlements to be treated as title holders to property. That was so in respect of either registered or unregistered land. Accordingly, criminally unlawful activity falling within s.144 could occur without it preventing a successful claim to acquire title by virtue of adverse possession. There was no overriding public policy concern associated with s.144 which ought to be taken to affect the usual balance of interests between landowner and adverse possessor, Bakewell Management Ltd v Brandwood [2004] UKHL 14, [2004] 2 A.C. 519 and R. (on the application of Smith) v Land Registry (Peterborough Office) [2009] EWHC 328 (Admin) considered. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 Pt 5 did not provide relevant guidance on the meaning and effect of s.144 in the context of its intended impact on the regime in Sch.6, and it provided no support for the registrar&#8217;s case. Moreover it was questionable whether the requirements of POCA had been satisfied in relation to the squatter&#8217;s acquisition of the house, because there were other acts of assertion of possession which he could rely on, such as maintaining the property and boundary fence. POCA operated a separate regime, and the illegality defence was not to be imported into the scheme of the 2002 Act in an attempt to short-circuit the POCA procedure (see paras 51-52, 56, 58, 63, 65, 67-73, 75, 80, 84-88, 90-95, 108 of judgment).</p></div></div> </div>

The contract to grant the underlease is void against the purchaser of the head lease, by virtue of the Land Charges Act, 1925, s.13(2), and the Law of Property Act, 1925, s.199(1)(i). 2. Although the purchaser of the head lease expressly takes subject to and with the benefit of such leases and tenancies as may affect the premises, he is not bound by an estate contract which has not been registered. 3. The vendor of the head lease who has contracted to grant an underlease but who sells before completion of the underlease is in breach of contract and, as demonstrated in Wright v Dean [1948] Ch. 686 , the damages will be substantial. 4. There is no duty on the underlessee to register the contract to prevent its being void against a purchaser of the head lease and thereby preventing the breach of contract. In 1945 a draft underlease for seven years was agreed between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The plaintiffs, who were the underlessees, completed and returned the counterpart to the defendants&#8217; solicitor but the defendants did not exchange their part, although periodically requested by the plaintiffs to complete. In 1947 the defendants sold the head lease to a third party, with notice that the plaintiffs held an underlease for seven years. The third party served a notice to quit on the plaintiffs on the footing that they were only yearly tenants. Held, on the facts of the case there was no contract between the plaintiffs and defendants, but, had there been a contract, the defendants would have committed a breach and would have been liable for substantial damages.

A purchaser or mortgagee needs to carry out a full inspection of property in order to discover who other than a husband is in occupation, and has to look behind the husband&#8217;s attempted concealment of his wife&#8217;s occupation. The marriage between a husband and wife broke down and the wife left the matrimonial home but returned there regularly, including sleeping there when the husband was away. The house was in the husband&#8217;s name. The husband approached mortgage brokers to obtain a loan of GBP 66,000 on the security of the house which was unregistered land. He signed the application form and stated that he was single. The brokers instructed a surveyor to carry out a survey and the husband arranged a time on a Sunday when the wife was away. The surveyor saw evidence of the occupation by the husband and his children, but no evidence of occupation by any other female. The husband told the surveyor that his wife had left many months ago, and was living with someone nearby. The plaintiffs made a loan offer which was accepted in the light of the surveyor&#8217;s report. Shortly after, the husband and son emigrated. The plaintiffs sought to enforce their charge and the question arose whether the charge was subject to or overrode the wife&#8217;s equitable interest. The plaintiffs contended that mere occupation in the case of unregistered land was not sufficient to protect a person claiming equitable rights against a purchaser or mortgagee of the legal estate unless the claimant was found in occupation or would have been found on proper inspection taking place. It was common ground that the surveyor was the plaintiffs&#8217; agent.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; that for physical presence to amount to actual occupation it did not have to be either exclusive or continuous and uninterrupted. Nor was it negatived by regular or repeated absence. Since on the facts the wife spent some part of virtually every day in the former matrimonial home, it was clear she had been in occupation and her change of habits had not altered that (dictum of Lord Wilberforce in Williams &amp; Glyn&#8217;s Bank Ltd v Boland [1981] A.C. 487 applied). When the surveyor discovered that the husband was married but separated he was under a duty to look for signs of occupation and to tell the plaintiffs. In any event, the reference in the report to the &#8220;son and daughter&#8221; itself should have put the plaintiffs on further inquiry which would have led them to discover the wife&#8217;s beneficial interest by virtue of the Law of Property Act 1925 s.199(1)(ii)(a) . They had knowledge of her beneficial interest and the mortgage took effect subject to those rights. The husband&#8217;s attempt to conceal the wife&#8217;s occupation could not be relied on by the plaintiff as preventing the need for further inquiry. Where a purchaser or mortgagee made reasonable inquiries and inspections and did not find the claimant in occupation or evidence sufficient to give notice of it, they were not fixed with notice of the claimant&#8217;s rights. In the case of residential property what was a reasonable inspection depended on all the circumstances. On the facts, the plaintiffs&#8217; pre-arranged inspection on a Sunday afternoon was not within the category of &#8220;such...inspections...as ought reasonably to have been made&#8221; under s.199(1)(ii) of the 1925 Act.

The lease was owned by RC, who had received the proceeds of sale as payment for the property under an oral agreement with his sister-in-law, MC, who was in possession. The judge below had held that the lease was held in trust for MC, but the bank argued that no equitable interest had been established, either by way of bare trust, constructive trust or proprietary estoppel, and that MC&#8217;s interest under the estate contract was unregistered and therefore void under the Land Charges Act 1972.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that although no agreement had been made in writing, the contract became enforceable when MC paid the purchase price which removed any beneficial interest RC had. A bare trust could not be established simply as an equitable consequence of that contract. Furthermore, once a specifically enforceable contract had been made it was not possible to establish a constructive trust in addition to the rights of MC under the contractual relationship. Nor was it possible to apply principles of proprietary estoppel, by arguing that MC carried out improvements to the property believing that she owned it, as a trust already arose from the contract, Lloyds Bank Plc v Rosset [1991] A.C. 107, [1990] C.L.Y. 706 considered. However, if the title to the property had been registered MC would have had an overriding interest binding on the bank under the Land Registration Act 1925 s.70(1)(g) as no enquiries had been made and MC was in possession.</div></div> </div>

A lessee by subdemise has the right to protect his mortgage, where it is of a term of years, by applying for relief from forfeiture under s.146 of the Act. That is a most important right possessed by a mortgagee by subdemise, for it may be the only way of saving his security in the hands of an insolvent lessee. The effect of s.87 is to give the mortgagee, by way of legal charge, this same right, because he has the same protection, as if he were an underlessee. The plaintiffs granted a lease of premises to the defendant. That lease contained a covenant against assigning or underletting the premises or any part thereof without the plaintiffs&#8217; consent and also a convenant not to use the premises or any part thereof for any illegal or immoral purpose and to use the same for a single private dwelling-house or for letting furnished apartments.

The bank should inform the surety that, for its own protection, it would require written confirmation from the solicitor that the nature of the documents and their practical implications had been fully explained. It should also inform the surety that the purpose of the written confirmation was to preclude the surety from subsequently disputing that the documents signed were legally binding, Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v Etridge (No.2) [2001] UKHL 44, [2002] 2 A.C. 773 and Barclays Bank Plc v O&#8217;Brien [1994] 1 A.C. 180 applied. In the instant case, the bank ought not to have proceeded with the transaction until it had communicated to the property owner the purpose underlying the requirement that she obtained legal advice and it had received an appropriate response from her. As a further preliminary step, the bank was required to furnish the nominated solicitor with information that would enable the solicitor to explain the financial risks to be assumed by the surety. On the evidence, the bank had not given that information to the solicitor. The bank had failed to take the necessary preliminary steps to protect itself and to constitute the solicitor as the property owner&#8217;s agent thereby entitling it to rely on the certificate of execution. The bank ought to have realised that she had not received the appropriate advice. In consequence, the charge was unenforceable (see paras 47-49, 63-64, 74 of judgment).</p></div></div> </div>

On August 1, 1979 P, after consulting solicitors, entered into a deferred sale agreement with D and became entitled to enter into occupation of a house which they were contractually bound to purchase in 12 months&#8217; time, with payment of interest meanwhile on the balance of the purchase price. They fell behind in their interest payments, but on September 2, 1980 completed the purchase and executed a charge over it to pay D the principal sum lent of GBP 17,450 plus interest at the rate of 25.785 per cent per annum over 10 years. They missed instalments, tried and failed to sell the house, and in January 1982 D started possession proceedings. In March P found a buyer and in April the house was transferred and the mortgage redeemed. D made no charge for interest on arrears of instalments. In May 1984 P brought proceedings seeking an order that the rate of interest stipulated under the legal charge be reduced to a proper rate on the grounds that the loan and terms of repayment constituted an extortionate credit bargain within the meaning of s.138 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, that the rate of interest was &#8220;grossly exorbitant,&#8221; and that the circumstances surrounding the loan and the charge &#8220;grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair trading.&#8221; The claim failed.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; that it was for the court to determine whether a credit bargain was &#8220;extortionate&#8221; and the meaning of the word was confined to the meaning given in s.138 (dictum of Browne-Wilkinson J. in Multiservice Bookbinding Ltd v Marden [1979] Ch. 84 considered). On the evidence P could not rely on their lack of business experience or financial pressure as relevant factors since they had been warned by independent solicitors and D that a mortgage would be expensive, and no advantage was taken of them by D. The degree of risk, accepted by D on the security offered was a relevant factor and justified the rate of interest charged, since P had found difficulty in obtaining a building society or other institutional loan. As to the remaining factor set out in s.138, namely prevailing interest rates, regard should be had to the true rate of interest, i.e. the annual percentage rate of charge calculated in accordance with the Consumer Credit (Total Charge for Credit) Regulations 1980 even though they did not apply to the loan in question. A comparison of rates charged by other lending bodies showed that the payments required of P fell far short of constituting the legal charge an &#8220;extortionate credit bargain&#8221; under s.138 or one which &#8220;grossly contravened&#8221; the principles of fair dealing (dictum of Sir John Donaldson in Wills v Wood (1984) 81 L.S.G. 1211 applied).</div></div> </div>

H had obtained a possession order in respect of C&#8217;s house. D and any family member of his had been prevented by H&#8217;s internal rules from purchasing repossessed houses. D persuaded M, his uncle, to purchase C&#8217;s house for GBP 140,000 and in a back to back transaction, D purchased C&#8217;s house from M. C&#8217;s house had been purchased at an undervalue and the judge found that D had not been a purchaser in good faith in accordance with the Law of Property Act 1925 s.205 so could not benefit from s.104 of the Act. The question on appeal was whether the sale to D had been liable to be set aside, not because D or H had known or should have known of the undervalue, but because D had deceived H in selling the house to him rather than to someone else.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal in part, that the sale did not have to be set aside because it had taken place at an undervalue. Impropriety had been a prerequisite. Section 104(2) of the Act made it clear that a purchaser would not be protected if he had actual knowledge of impropriety. D&#8217;s deception of H had not conferred upon C any right to set aside the sale which they would not have possessed against any other purchaser at an undervalue who did not know of the undervalue and who had not been involved in the exercise of the power of sale by H. The sale would have been voidable by H but this would not have been relevant to C. The sale had to be tainted by impropriety and not have been just at an undervalue. Equity would only intervene if there had been impropriety or bad faith on the part of the mortgagee. The lack of good faith had had nothing to do with C, only H. Accordingly C had not been affected. The judge had been wrong to set the sale aside on the basis that D could not take the benefit of s.104(2). The judge had also exercised his discretion to set aside the sale wrongly as he had failed to consider delay, the work carried out to the property, the fact that it was a family home to minor children and that there had been a rise in property prices.</div></div> </div>

Adverse possession referred to the capacity of a person in possession of land and not to the nature of that person&#8217;s possession. Possession had to be given its ordinary meaning. C were in ordinary possession of the property in the period following the grant of the mortgage and after the last payment to N. That possession was exclusive possession. N had a right to possession of the property, but it was not in possession of the property. C were prima facia in adverse possession of the property at the material time, being the persons in whose favour time could run under the Act and N&#8217;s right of action be treated as accruing. The crucial issue was whether any good reason had been shown for treating C other than in ordinary possession of the property. There was no such reason. There was no evidence that C applied for, or were positively given, express permission by N to remain in possession of the property after the legal charge or after the last payment made in respect of the mortgage debt. Although N had never enforced its right to possession against C it did not necessarily follow that N had impliedly granted them permission to remain in possession of the property so as to prevent them from being in adverse possession within Sch.1 para.8 of the Act. N had simply chosen not to do anything to enforce its right of action. C did not need N&#8217;s permission to possess the property. Their possession of the property was referable to their own registered legal title to the property. It was not derived from N&#8217;s title to the property. Accordingly C had been in adverse possession for a period of over 12 years and the judge was right to grant the declaration that N&#8217;s legal charge was extinguished by reason of the operation of s.15 and s.17 of the Act.</p></div></div> </div>

Clause 17.16 virtually entitled X to be judge in its own cause as to whether the clause was satisfied and, if so, whether it had a potentially drastic effect on C&#8217;s economic position. The court had to be convinced that X had formed the requisite honest and rational opinion. The first instance judge had over-complicated the position with regard to X&#8217;s decision-making process. It was difficult to identify any evidence contrary to X&#8217;s case, and the event of default was made out. X was entitled to accelerate the loan under cl.17.18 (see paras 43-62 of judgment). (2) The judge&#8217;s findings afforded no basis for treating the appropriation as ineffective. In equity, a mortgagee had a limited title which was available only to secure satisfaction of the debt. The security was enforceable for that purpose only, Quennell v Maltby [1979] 1 W.L.R. 318 and Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd [1993] A.C. 295 applied. It followed that any act by way of enforcement of the security purely for a collateral purpose would be ineffective between mortgagor and mortgagee. The fact that it was an incident which was highly attractive to X did not mean that the right of appropriation was exercised in bad faith. If a chargee enforced his security for the proper purpose of satisfying the debt, the fact that he might have additional purposes which were collateral to that object could not vitiate enforcement. If the law were otherwise, the result would be that the exercise of the right to enforce the charge for its proper purpose would be indefinitely impeded because of other aspects of the chargee&#8217;s state of mind, which were by definition irrelevant (paras 73-79). (3) C&#8217;s case for relief in equity was distinct from their case on bad faith and improper purpose. It did not therefore follow from rejection of the latter case that equitable relief should not be afforded on appropriate terms; it had to be considered on its own terms as a freestanding remedy. The issues were whether the court had jurisdiction to grant such relief and, if so, whether it should and on what terms. Repayment of the loan to X was secured by equitable mortgages over the charged shares. The primary object of the bargain was to secure the repayment of the loan together with contractual interest, and the forfeiture provision, namely the power to appropriate, was added to secure that result. It followed that, unless it could be said that the jurisdiction to give such relief was limited to mortgages of real property, no convincing reason had been identified as to why there should not be jurisdiction. On the contrary, it was a classic case for the exercise of the jurisdiction; there was no principled basis on which jurisdiction could be limited to real property, Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding [1973] A.C. 691 and BICC Plc v Burndy Corp [1985] Ch. 232 applied (paras 80-97). There was nothing in the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No.2) Regulations 2003 precluding the availability of relief against forfeiture in such circumstances (paras 98-115). The need for commercial certainty was recognised; however, the instant case involved a combination of unusual features which were unlikely to be repeated. Relief against forfeiture would be available to C on appropriate conditions to be determined (paras 116-126).</p></div></div> </div>

That circumstance, together with the statutory context and the language employed, indicated that s.36 had not been intended to deal with the protection of a borrower against a lender who exercised his common law right to take possession by peaceable entry without seeking a possession order.

When A fell into arrears, AIB obtained a possession order and judgment for arrears and principal. The business closed prior to AIB repossessing the property and the sale of the premises yielded a shortfall in respect of which AIB served statutory demands on A. The district judge set aside the statutory demands on the ground that A had a defence and a potentially substantial counterclaim based on AIB&#8217;s failure to sell the business as a going concern. A appealed against a ruling ([1997] 4 All E.R. 677, [1997] C.L.Y. 3033) allowing AIB&#8217;s appeal against the setting aside of the statutory demands, the judge finding that, while A had an arguable counterclaim, it would not &#8220;equal or exceed&#8221; the amount of the statutory demand as required by the Insolvency Rules 1986 r.6.5(4)(a) . A disputed the judge&#8217;s valuation of the counterclaim and argued that AIB had a duty of care to take steps to preserve the goodwill of the business and ensure that it was included in the sale.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that, while a mortgagee owed the mortgagor a duty to take reasonable care to obtain a proper price for the sale of mortgaged property and in some circumstances that might include a duty to attempt to sell a business as a going concern, in the instant case the proprietors had closed down the business and moved from the premises prior to the mortgagee repossessing the property, and no duty to safeguard the goodwill of the business could arise in those circumstances. There was no question of AIB being under any duty to take action to preserve the business until it took possession of it, although the bank would have had the power to appoint a receiver and manager of the business if they had chosen to. Accordingly, the judge below had been wrong to conclude that A had an arguable counterclaim.</div></div> </div>

Read as a whole, s.101 of the Act implemented rather than overrode the private bargain between mortgagor and mortgagee.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Judgment for claimant.<p>(1) B had lost the equity of redemption in the property without statutory intervention. The receivers&#8217; power to sell the property was derived wholly from the mortgage contract. There was no corresponding power under the Act. On a strict analysis of the facts of the instant case, the issue for determination never arose. However the outcome of such an important question should not remain unanswered and the analysis of the legal position would continue as if s.101 had been engaged. (2) It was clear that s.101 of the Act served to implement rather than override the private bargain between mortgagor and mortgagee. It was a form of conveyancing shorthand designed to implement the ordinary expectations of mortgagors and mortgagees whilst reducing the costs and delays therein. Section.101 of the Act was expressed to be subject to the doctrine of &#8220;contrary intention&#8221; pursuant to s.101(4) of the Act. Accordingly, s.101 of the Act, read as a whole, was very far removed from the concept of state intervention into private rights through overriding legislation. It was not rigid, arbitrary or discriminatory and its effect was not only apparent on its face but, in the instant case, was spelt out in terms in the mortgage itself, Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No.2) [2003] UKHL 40, [2004] 1 A.C. 816 and Ropaigealach v Barclays Bank Plc [2000] Q.B. 263 applied and Pennycook v Shaws (EAL) Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 100, [2004] Ch. 296 considered. The exercise of a statutory power of sale under s.101 of the Act after a relevant default by the mortgagor was not a deprivation of possession within the meaning of the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 Protocol 1 art.1 and neither was the exercise by receivers acting under purely contractual powers in overriding B&#8217;s equity of redemption by contracting to sell the property. (3) (Obiter) Any deprivation of possession constituted by the exercise by a mortgagee of its powers under s.101 of the Act after a relevant default was justified in the public interest and required no case-by-case exercise of a proportionality exercise by the court. It clearly reflected the bargain habitually and historically drawn between mortgagors and mortgagees, in which the ability of a mortgagee to sell the property offered as a security without having to go to court was identified as an essential aspect of the security necessary if substantial property based security lending was to be available at affordable rates of interest, Barclays Bank Plc v Alcorn [2002] EWHC 498 (Ch), [2002] 2 P. &amp; C.R.

It was true that, when valuing the property, there was no real comparable that could be justifiably relied upon to assess the property&#8217;s market value. It was self-evident that the original asking price was far too low, and it was surprising that the sales particulars or advertisements did not mention the property&#8217;s potential for conversion into flats. Although the estate agent had explained the low asking price and the lack of a reference to development potential, the instant court still had serious misgivings about how the property was marketed: it did not regard it as sensible, even in the sale by a mortgagee, to put a property on the market at a grossly inadequate price simply to generate interest, or to neglect to mention its development potential. However, despite those justifiable criticisms, the property was sufficiently exposed to the market to enable all potential purchasers to bid for it if they so wished. The absence of any reference to development potential in the advertising and the low asking price had not deterred potential purchasers, including developers, from making offers above the asking price. Further, £325,000 did not represent the price which could and should have been achieved for the property at the date of sale. There was no evidence to establish that the price obtained for the property was less than the best price reasonably achievable. The market value of a property was the price which a willing purchaser was prepared to pay to a willing vendor after the property had been exposed to the market for a reasonable period of time. It followed that, in the instant case, the property&#8217;s market value when the contracts of sale were exchanged was the sum actually agreed to be paid, namely £221,500. It was possible that a developer such as the actual purchaser in the instant case could have made similar calculations to M&#8217;s expert and concluded that the property was potentially worth to it as much as £325,000. However, unless a bidding war developed between two or more developers who had made similar calculations, such a sum could not be said to represent the best price reasonably achievable for the property at that time, and did not represent its true market value. Accordingly, G had not breached its duty to M, Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance [1971] Ch. 949 applied (see paras 12, 19, 23 of judgment).</p></div></div> </div>

T obtained a mortgage from HBS by making false representations as to his identity and creditworthiness. On his subsequent default the property was sold and the surplus was placed in a suspense account. T was convicted and the CPS sought a confiscation order and a charging order on the suspense account. HBS argued that to allow T to keep the money would be an unjust enrichment brought about by the commission of a wrong against it. HBS also argued that it might recover the money through waiver of tort or on the basis of being a beneficiary to a constructive trust .</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that (1) the relationship of lender and borrower was that of debtor and creditor and it was never contemplated by the parties that T would incur liability other than debt. On the sale, he became entitled to the proceeds. The effect of condition 23 of the Law Society&#8217;s Mortgage conditions operating on the Law of Property Act 1925 s.105 was not to make T liable to account to HBS for the money as money &#8220;due under the mortgage&#8221; and secured by the mortgage; (2) it was inconsistent with the mortgage to argue that T could sue in tort for deceit to recover any shortfall which the security did not cover. T did not need to rely on illegality to support his claim and his rights were not denied, Tinsley v Milligan [1994] A.C. 340, [1993] C.L.Y. 1839 followed and (3) having affirmed the mortgage HBS remained only a secured creditor. The Criminal Justice Act 1988 Part IV prevented the criminal from keeping the benefits of his crime and the courts also had power to confiscate that benefit. A remedy for unjust enrichment was not provided by a constructive trust.</div></div> </div>

The house was conveyed into the names of D and his brother. D told P her name was not going onto the title because it would prejudice pending matrimonial proceedings between P and her husband. GBP 1,043 of the purchase price of GBP 5,490 was paid in cash by D. The remainder was raised by means of two mortgages. The mortgage repayments were made by D. After they moved into the house P paid D GBP 6 per week. A second child was born on 13 July 1971. In addition there were two children from P&#8217;s earlier marriage.

The trial judge rejected her claim.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing P&#8217;s appeal, that the court would find a constructive trust giving P a beneficial interest if P was able to establish a common intention between her and D and acted on by her that she should have a beneficial interest in the property. In acting to her detriment the conduct required of P was conduct that she could not reasonably be expected to embark upon unless she was to have an interest in the house. In the present case the common intention of the parties that P was to have a beneficial interest in the house was established by the excuse given by D to P for not putting her name on the title of the house; such an excuse could only have been necessary if it was intended that P should have an interest in the house. It could properly be inferred that P made substantial contributions to the mortgage payments by her contributions towards the housekeeping given that the parties had barely sufficient money when they were both earning similar sums of money. P could not reasonably have been expected to give D such substantial assistance in making the mortgage payments unless she was to have an interest in the house. Accordingly P acted to her detriment on the faith of the common intention of the parties that she should have an interest in the house. P was entitled to a half interest in the house. Mustill L.J. set out a summary of the relevant propositions of law to be applied in such cases (Pettitt v Pettitt [1970] A.C. 777, Gissing v Gissing [1971] A.C. 886, Eves v Eves [1975] 1 W.L.R. 1338, Midland Bank Plc v Dobson [1986] 1 F.L.R. 171 considered).</div></div> </div>

There was no express agreement between R and H between November and 17 December that R would have a beneficial interest in the property and no express evidence of discussions to that effect.

P had bought L in April 2001 by using the proceeds of sale of her previous home, being a little under GBP 9,000, a mortgage for GBP 138,480 and GBP 6,000 cash. C paid no part of the purchase price.

The onus was upon the person seeking to show that the parties intended their beneficial interests to be different from their legal interests and in what way. Context was everything, and each case would turn on its own facts. Many more factors than financial contributions could be relevant to intention, and the court gave a non-exhaustive list. Cases in which the joint legal owners were to be taken to have intended that their beneficial interests should be different from their legal interests would be very unusual. Accordingly, it was for D to show that the common intention when they bought the house was that she and S should hold the property otherwise than as joint beneficial tenants, and there were, on the evidence, many factors for her to rely on. The fact that she and S had lived together for such a long time and had children together, yet had kept their affairs rigidly separate, was strongly indicative that they did not intend their shares, even in the property that was put into their joint names, to be equal, and she had made good her case for a higher share, Pettitt v Pettitt [1970] A.C. 777 considered, Oxley v Hiscock [2004] EWCA Civ 546, [2005] Fam. 211 applied and Walker v Hall [1984] Fam. Law 21 , Springette v Defoe [1992] 2 F.L.R. 388 and Huntingford v Hobbs [1993] 1 F.L.R. 736 doubted. (2) In determining the issue of payments from D to S for his alternative accommodation, the criteria laid down in the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 were to be applied in preference to cases pre-dating that regime. The judge at first instance had erred in failing to apply those criteria and the Court of Appeal had been correct to quash his order in this respect. (3) (Per Lord Neuberger) Although the judge&#8217;s reason for ordering D to pay S&#8217;s accommodation costs had been weak, partly because he had not been referred to the 1996 Act, a proper exercise of the court&#8217;s power under s.14 of the Act would, in the circumstances, have been to order the compensation at the level the parties had originally agreed.</p></div></div> </div>

It appeared to have attached undue significance to the dictum of Lord Bridge in Rosset , in particular as to what conduct was to be taken into account in quantifying an acknowledged beneficial interest. The law had moved on since then, Rosset disapproved. The parties&#8217; whole course of conduct in relation to a property had to be taken into account in determining their shared intentions as to its ownership, Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 A.C. 432 applied. If a parent gave financial assistance to a newly-married couple to acquire a home, the usual inference was that it was intended as a gift to both of them, McHardy &amp; Sons v Warren [1994] 2 F.L.R. 338 and Midland Bank Plc v Cooke [1995] 4 All E.R. 562 considered. In the instant case, that inference was supported by H and W&#8217;s behaviour throughout the marriage. The fact that they arranged their finances entirely jointly and undertook joint liability for the repayment of the mortgage was significant, Hyett v Stanley [2003] EWCA Civ 942, [2004] 1 F.L.R. 394 considered. The Court of Appeal appeared not to have attached any weight to that factor. (2) The shares belonged to H exclusively. W had made a concession to that effect before the Court of Appeal, and that concession was properly made. (3) The judge at first instance had been correct to find that H and W owned the furniture in the matrimonial home in equal shares. However, he had made an adjustment based on W&#8217;s estimate of the costs of purchasing the furniture in 1991. That was unrealistic, as in the intervening years much of the furniture would be of little value. Some had been disposed of, and W had declined to take any of it with her when she left the matrimonial home. (4) There should be an order that the house be sold and the proceeds divided equally, subject to an adjustment in favour of W for 20 per cent of the costs of acquiring the furniture.</p></div></div> </div>

In the absence of an express agreement, the parties&#8217; intentions, actual or inferred, with respect to the property had to be ascertained in the light of the whole course of their conduct in relation to it, Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 A.C. 432 applied. (2) As a matter of law, a presumption of joint beneficial ownership arose from the fact that B and F were joint legal owners, Stack applied. It was open to B to rebut that presumption. There was only circumstantial evidence of the parties&#8217; intentions. The relevant intention of each party was the intention that was reasonably understood by the other party to be manifested by that party&#8217;s words or conduct, Gissing v Gissing [1971] A.C. 886 applied. Thus any secret intention of B that F should only benefit in the event of his death and on the basis that they were then still living together, did not provide the evidential basis for rebutting the presumption, since it was not evidence of the parties&#8217; shared intention. B&#8217;s mistaken belief as to the effect of putting the property into joint names was of no materiality. He had not communicated his belief to F, and there was no basis for saying that it should have been apparent to her. The fact that F had signed the mortgage deed, although she was not expected to make any payment towards the discharge of the mortgage debt, was not inconsistent with the shared intention that she should be a joint beneficial owner. As regards the amount of the parties&#8217; contributions, that was not necessarily a critical factor. It could be inferred that F had contributed to the household expenses for which both parties were responsible and the parties had intended that it should make no difference to their interests in the property which party paid for what expense. The proper inference from the execution of mutual wills was that the parties intended each to have an interest. There was no logical reason why F&#8217;s interest should be equal to a one half-share of the proportion that the mortgage loan bore to the total acquisition cost to the property since the parties could not have expected her actually to contribute to that amount. Accordingly, B had not discharged the onus on him of showing that it was not the parties&#8217; shared intention that F should have a one half-share in the property.</p></div></div> </div>

This was so, despite the nature of the familial relationship between the parties, Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 A.C. 432 distinguished. In the instant case, the purchase of the property was nothing more than a business venture. Both parties led separate and distinct lives and maintained separate and distinct finances. It was clear that R had been brought into the transaction on the basis that it had been necessary to name her as a joint tenant in order to raise the requisite finances on the property. Despite its familial appearance, the relationship was one between investors, and the presumption of joint ownership did not apply in such circumstances. Accordingly, there was nothing more than a resulting trust, and each party was entitled to the value of her own contribution. (2) The award of discount under s.129 of the Act had been made to Z on the basis of her long tenancy as sole tenant. R had been named as joint tenant comparatively recently and only as a mechanism to raise finance on the property. Therefore, the beneficial interest would not follow the legal interest and the judge had been correct to treat the discount as a contribution solely made by Z, Springette v Defoe [1992] 2 F.L.R. 388, Evans (formerly Newton) v Hayward [1992] N.P.C. 85, and Ashe (Trustee in Bankruptcy of Henry Samuel Mumford) v Mumford (No.2) [2001] B.P.I.R. 1, applied. (3) By virtue of the fact that both R and Z were jointly liable under the mortgage, it was correct to treat the mortgage as representing equal contributions to the purchase price. That was especially the case where mortgage repayments were funded by the rent on the property and not by the personal finances of the parties. Accordingly, on the basis of her contributions, R&#8217;s beneficial interest in the property was raised appropriately to represent the uplift created by her mortgage contribution.</p><p></p></div></div> </div>

On the evidence before the court it was apparent that before the property was purchased, it was intended that H would be named as a joint purchaser, but that intention could not be effected as the local authority would not accept H&#8217;s name on the legal title of the property. Parts of H&#8217;s case were well-founded but at times he was prone to exaggerate the extent to which he had actually implemented such intentions as there may have been at the time of the original purchase. The intention that H should participate had survived the news that the local authority would not accept his name on the title. That was consistent with the terms of letters written by their solicitor at the time, and the solicitor&#8217;s suggestion that a trust deed should be drawn up to protect H&#8217;s position. However, it was clear that there was no express agreement between M, H or B as to how the property was to be held by them or in what shares, and there was no satisfactory explanation as to why they had not entered into a trust deed either before the property was purchased or afterwards. The fact that the transfer form stated that M and B held the property as joint tenants was of little relevance as it was apparent that M could not read English and there was no evidence that at the time of the transfer she understood what a joint tenancy was. On the evidence before the court H had not made a full initial contribution towards the purchase price nor had he consistently contributed monies towards payment of the mortgage. However, he had made some payments to clear mortgage arrears and had made other payments towards insurance and household items for the property. H had taken out an endowment policy in the full sum of the purchase price before the mortgage was drawn down, as B had also done, and that policy had been taken out with the mortgage in mind, but H&#8217;s endowment policy had not been charged as security. It was also noteworthy that for a considerable period, the mortgage payments had been made through the use of benefits received by M and rent received from lodgers at the property and that the property purchase had been made possible through the use of M&#8217;s discount which was greater than the purchase price. Against all of that background H had not made out his case that there was any express agreement as to the shares in which the property should be held. Accordingly, adopting an holistic approach to the parties&#8217; whole course of conduct in relation to the property, M&#8217;s share in the property was quantified at 50 per cent, and the shares of H and B&#8217;s estate were quantified at 25 per cent each, Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 A.C. 432 applied and Abbott v Abbott [2007] UKPC 53, [2008] 1 F.L.R. 1451 considered.</p></div></div> </div>

That presumption could be rebutted by evidence of a contrary intention, which might more readily be shown where the parties had contributed to the acquisition of the property in unequal shares, but each case would turn on its own facts. It was for the court to ascertain the parties&#8217; common intention as to what their shares in the property would be, in the light of their whole course of conduct in relation to it, Gissing v Gissing [1971] A.C. 886 and Oxley v Hiscock [2004] EWCA Civ 546, [2005] Fam. 211 applied, Stack followed (see paras 10-15, 25, 51 of judgment). Any challenge to the presumption was not to be lightly embarked on, since a decision to buy a property in joint names indicated an emotional and economic commitment to a joint enterprise, and the notion that in a trusting personal relationship the parties did not hold each other to account financially, was underpinned by the practical difficulty of taking any such account after years of living together (paras 19-22). The search was primarily to ascertain the parties&#8217; actual shared intentions, whether expressed or to be inferred from their conduct. However, where it was clear that the beneficial interests were to be shared, but it was impossible to divine a common intention as to the proportions in which they were to be shared, it was for the court to impute an intention to the parties which they might never have had. The court could not impose a solution on them which was contrary to what the evidence showed that they actually intended (paras 31, 46-47). Where a family home was put into the name of one party only, the starting point was different, and the first issue was whether it was intended that the other party should have any beneficial interest at all: there was no presumption of joint beneficial ownership, but their common intention had again to be deduced from their conduct (para.52). In the instant case there was no need to impute an intention that the parties&#8217; beneficial interests would change, as the judge had made a finding that their intention did in fact change, and that was an intention which he both could have and should have inferred from their conduct. The calculation of their shares by the instant court produced a result so close to that produced by the judge that it would be wrong for the instant court to interfere (paras 48-49).</p></div></div> </div>

G had worked in the business to a greater extent than R had admitted and had not been paid wages; those facts pointed to a partnership. The remainder of the evidence, however, weighed against a partnership: the business&#8217;s accounts listed R as a sole trader, the accounts showed no evidence of sharing of profits, the net profits from the business went to R, all drawings on the accounts were made by R, G had not been held out as a partner, there had not been a joint bank account, and G always had to ask R when she needed money. Moreover, the business carried on while G and R were separated; had there been a partnership it would have been at will, and it would have been dissolved when G left. Finally, D had told G that the business should remain solely in his name so that G would be shielded from liability in the event of bankruptcy; that was a strong pointer against inferring partnership. There had thus been ample evidence to support the judge&#8217;s conclusion that there was no business partnership. Even if there had been a partnership, it would not follow that the property was partnership property. A partnership in profits did not indicate that the asset itself was partnership property. One partner might solely own property that the partnership used in its business; in the instant case the property had been acquired with R&#8217;s own money before the partnership could have arisen (see paras 11-16 of judgment). (2) As the property was titled solely in R&#8217;s name, G had the burden of establishing a constructive trust. The relevant question was whether there had been a common intention that G would have a beneficial interest in the property, Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53, [2012] 1 A.C. 776 applied. The common intention had to be determined objectively from the parties&#8217; conduct. Although G had presented evidence that the parties had had a common intention to run the business together, it was an impermissible leap to reach a conclusion of a common intention that the property in which the business had been run, which had been bought by only one of them, would now belong to both of them.

It ordered a stay of the receivers&#8217; power of sale pending investigation of whether the husband&#8217;s share could be sold to the wife and ordered the Crown Prosecution Service to pay the wife&#8217;s costs in full.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Judgment for claimant.<p>(1) The established principles of law emanating from a long stream of authority ending with Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53, [2012] 1 A.C. 776, was that the burden of proof was on W to displace the presumption that equity followed the law and that H held the beneficial interest in the property. Their common intention was to be deduced objectively from their conduct and careful scrutiny of the evidence was required. If W had a beneficial interest, which was not referable to a direct financial contribution and its size could not be ascertained by direct evidence or common intention, the court had to determine the fair size of the interest having regard to the whole course of dealings between H and W in relation to the property (see paras 7-14 of judgment). On the evidence, W was probably telling the truth when she said that she had contributed £30,000 towards the purchase price (para.57). Whether she had a beneficial interest depended on H&#8217;s and W&#8217;s common intention in 1999, immediately before H was arrested; if she had no such interest by that time, they could not subvert the restraint order by subsequently forming a common intention that what was still beneficially his should become beneficially hers. From 1992 the evidence showed that there had been, and still was, a close and trusting relationship between H and W. Although their respective interests in the property had rarely been discussed, everything about their interaction, together with contemporaneous documentation from 1996 and 1997, led to the conclusion that W had an interest which amounted to co-ownership even though neither party had consciously formed such an intention, Jones and Gissing v Gissing [1971] A.C. 886 applied (paras 77-79). (2) W&#8217;s beneficial interest amounted to a half share. Although she had not paid half of the purchase price, there was not the least indication that H or W had intended or understood that W should have a fractional share calculated by reference to their respective contributions. On the evidence, co-ownership had been their common intention and that word, as used by a lay person, denoted shared or equal ownership (paras 80-84). (3) The power of sale was stayed for seven weeks to enable investigation of a possible sale of H&#8217;s share to W. The judge and counsel discussed the receiver&#8217;s potential duties arising from the money laundering provisions (paras 88, 104-154). (4) W was awarded her costs in full under the CPR r.44.3 because she had consistently maintained that she had a half share in the property and had clearly been &#8220;wholly successful&#8221; in her claim. The Crown Prosecution Service had a duty to ensure that confiscation orders were fully and effectively enforced, yet it was fundamental to the interrelation between criminal confiscation proceedings and proceedings of the instant type that decisions made in the criminal courts did not bind, and thereby prejudice, persons who were not party to those criminal proceedings. W&#8217;s costs amounted to £90,000. Despite a great deal of sympathy for the CPS, there was no justification for departing from the general costs rule. Under CPR r.44.3(8) an order for a £25,000 payment on account of costs was made in W&#8217;s favour (paras 327-403).</p></div></div> </div>

However, it was also clear on the judge&#8217;s findings that neither F nor S had expressed an intention whether the £5,000 was a gift or whether it would entitle F and M to a beneficial interest in the property.

He had held that F had said that he hoped to purchase the property from S as soon as he could, and in those circumstances it was clear that F and M&#8217;s subjective intention was that the £5,000 would stand to their credit for when they eventually bought the property, and that they had paid that sum for their own benefit and not as a gift to S.

First, the person claiming the beneficial interest had to show that there was an agreement that he should have a beneficial interest, even if there was no agreement as to the precise extent of that interest. Second, if such an agreement could be shown to have been made, but there was no agreement on the extent of the interest, the court could impute an intention that the person was to have a fair beneficial share in the asset, Oxley v Hiscock [2004] EWCA Civ 546, [2005] Fam. 211, Stack v Dowden [2005] EWCA Civ 857, [2006] 1 F.L.R. 254 and Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53, [2012] 1 A.C. 776 considered. The court was not entitled to impute an intention to the parties at the first stage in the analysis; an actual agreement had to be found to have been made (see paras 16-17 of judgment). (2) The judge had erroneously elided the two stages. She had imputed an intention to the parties for the first stage of the analysis rather than identifying an actual agreement that H should have any beneficial interest in Sunnyside. No actual agreement to that effect had ever been made between the parties. C was the sole legal and beneficial owner of Sunnyside and Beaumont. H had no valid claim to a beneficial interest in either of those properties (paras 18-23). (3) H was the sole legal and beneficial owner of the shares in the company, and C had no beneficial interest in them. She had sold the business to H&#8217;s company in 2007 in return for a payment by H of £750 per week. The company was the sole owner of the business, and C had no beneficial interest in the business or the company. The payment of £750 per week was agreed to last while H was in occupation of Sunnyside or until the interest-only mortgage expired in 2019, whichever was sooner. There was a strong probability that Sunnyside would have to be sold by C in 2019 in order to repay the mortgage, as contemplated by the parties (paras 24, 26, 28).</p></div></div> </div>

The fact that they affected a greater number of women than men had an objective and reasonable justification.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeals dismissed.<p>(Lady Hale and Lord Kerr dissenting, and Lord Carnwath concurring with the result but for different reasons) (1) The Regulations undoubtedly pursued a legitimate aim. The Government concluded in 2010 that expenditure on benefits was unaffordable. All three policy reasons were equally legitimate. S&#8217;s argument that a fairer system would have set the cap using as a benchmark not the average earnings of working households, but their average income including benefits, was problematic for several reasons. One reason was that the Welfare Reform Act 2012 s.96, whose compatibility with the ECHR was not challenged, required the cap to be set by reference to &#8220;earnings&#8221;; the Regulations would be ultra vires if they failed to do so. Other criticisms focused on the cap&#8217;s impact upon the income of the households most affected. The cap was set at £35,000 per annum; the median earnings of working households. Half of all working households earned less than that. Whether non-working households should receive more was a political question, which it was not the court&#8217;s function to determine. Importantly, affected households had received advance notice of their income reduction, and assistance had been made available to help them address the implications. It was highly significant that no credible means had been put forward by which the legitimate aims of the Regulations might have been achieved without impacting more women than men. As women headed most of the households at which the aims were directed, a disparity between the numbers of men and women affected was inevitable. That was because child-related benefits were included within the scope of the cap. But if they were not so included, the cap&#8217;s legitimate aims would not have been achieved (see paras 63-69, 72-73, 76-77 of judgment). S&#8217;s argument that the secretary of state was obliged by the Human Rights Act 1998 s.6 to treat the best interests of the child as a primary consideration in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child art.3(1) was also problematic. The cap impacted the children of affected households, and the children&#8217;s Convention, although not part of UK law, was relevant to issues involving children&#8217;s rights. However, the instant context was not one in which the adults&#8217; rights were inseparable from the best interests of their children. The consequences of the cap for children depended upon how their parents responded to it. There was no relationship between the fact that the cap affected more women than men on the one hand, and the assumed failure of the legislation to give primacy to the interests of children on the other (paras 78, 81-82, 86-87, 89). Proportionality involved issues of social and economic policy, the determination of which was for democratically-elected institutions. The court had to respect assessments performed by those institutions unless they were manifestly without foundation. The Regulations had been considered and approved by both Houses of Parliament (paras 93-96). (2) (Per Lord Carnwath) Child-related benefits existed to meet children&#8217;s needs. The cap deprived children of their benefits for reasons unrelated to their own needs. The secretary of state had not shown how the Regulations were compatible with the obligation to treat children&#8217;s best interests as a primary consideration. However, the consequences of that were to be dealt with in a political, rather than a legal, arena (paras 124-128, 133). (3) (Per Lady Hale) The duty to treat children&#8217;s best interests as a primary consideration under art.3(1) of the children&#8217;s Convention was binding on the UK as part of its international obligations. The duty was relevant to proportionality and discrimination, whether affecting children or their mothers. The question was whether the benefit cap could be justified independently of its discriminatory effect. That involved asking whether proper account had been taken of children&#8217;s interests. Clearly it had not, because the cap deprived them of the basic necessities of life. The cap could not, therefore, be viewed as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim (paras 215-216, 218-227, 229).</p></div></div> </div>

There was nothing to indicate that the interests of the chargee took priority over the interests of any resident children; (3) there was nothing in the language of the 1996 Act to indicate that it upheld the old concept of the trust for sale, and (4) Byrne supported the reasoning in the Law of Property Act 1925 s.30 that a case involving a bankrupt co-owner should be treated the same as one involving an application for possession by a chargee. It was evident that Parliament now contemplated a different approach, having regard to Law Com No.181, which gave rise to the 1996 Act. The language of the 1996 Act suggested that Parliament had intended the courts to have a wider discretion in favour of families as against chargees.

B was declared bankrupt and the respondent (T) was appointed trustee in bankruptcy. T applied for a declaration for an absolute beneficial interest in the property and for an order for possession and sale. B asserted that his former partner (C) had a beneficial interest in the property and that their son (S) lived with B in the property most days per week. B alleged that S had special educational needs that were helped by living with B in the property. The deputy registrar was not prepared to proceed with the application as to the beneficial interests in the property but proceeded with the application for possession and sale of the property, notwithstanding C&#8217;s claim. The main issue between the parties was whether the court should make an order for sale pursuant to the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 s.14 and the Insolvency Act 1986 s.335A. The deputy registrar heard argument from both sides as to whether there were exceptional circumstances under s.335A of the 1986 Act and ordered B to give vacant possession of the property. B resisted an order for possession and sale of the property on the basis that (1) such an order would disrupt the education of S and that if B was rendered homeless S&#8217;s progress would be severely curtailed. Therefore the hardship which would be caused to S by an order for possession and sale constituted &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; under s.335A of the 1986 Act; and (2) the order had failed to take into account his or S&#8217;s rights under the Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that (1) s.335A of the 1986 Act, which applied if C had an equitable interest in the property, gave statutory effect to the previous case law relating to the interests of a bankrupt&#8217;s creditors, which was reviewed in Citro (Domenico) (A Bankrupt), Re [1991] Ch. 142, in which it was found that in a case in which both the bankrupt and his spouse had a beneficial interest in the matrimonial home, the creditors&#8217; interest in achieving a sale of the property within a short period would usually prevail over the interests of the spouse unless exceptional circumstances were shown. In almost all of the reported decisions the interests of the creditors had prevailed, Holliday (A Bankrupt), Re [1981] Ch. 405 distinguished. The view taken by the deputy registrar could not be faulted on the basis that the law was as stated in Citro . S&#8217;s problems could not be said to be extreme and further, unlike Citro , the instant case was not one in which there would be any question of S having to leave his present school. (2) The state had to have regard to the fair balance that had to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual, Cossey v United Kingdom (10843/84) [1991] 2 F.L.R. 492 applied. It was questionable whether the narrow approach as to what might be &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; adopted in Citro was consistent with the European Convention on Human Rights 1950. In particular, it might be incompatible with Convention rights to follow the approach taken by the majority in Citro , in drawing a distinction between what was exceptional, in the sense of being unusual, and what Nourse, L.J. referred to in Citro as the &#8220;usual melancholy consequences&#8221; of a bankruptcy. A shift in emphasis in the interpretation of the statute might be necessary to achieve compatibility with the Convention. Thus it might be that, on a reconsideration of s.335A, or the corresponding wording in s.336 and s.337, those sections were to be regarded as recognising that, in the general run of cases, the creditors&#8217; interests would outweigh all other interests, but leaving it open to a court to find that, on a proper consideration of the facts of a particular case, it was one of the exceptional cases in which that proposition was not true. So interpreted, and without the possibly undue bias in favour of the creditors&#8217; property interests embodied in the pre 1998 case law, those sections would be compatible with the Convention. However, on the facts of the instant case, the decision of the deputy registrar should be upheld as the prejudice to the creditors would be substantial, S&#8217;s educational problems were not severe and it was unclear if B&#8217;s ability to help S would be impaired and if so to what extent.</div></div> </div>

The first respondent (L) had been X&#8217;s trustee in bankruptcy and had applied for an order for sale of the property under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 s.14. N and X lived apart and N resided in the property. Medical evidence indicated that N had a chronic health condition. N was also the joint owner of another property that was inhabited by her brother who was the other owner. N&#8217;s open offer to L, which provided for orders for possession and sale of the property owned by her and X to be suspended in certain circumstances, and for charges over the other property, was not accepted. At the hearing L argued that the main drawback of the offer was that X&#8217;s creditors would be unlikely to receive anything towards payment of the bankruptcy debt in the near future. The judge decided that he could not make an order reflecting the offer as it would directly affect the other property, which was not the subject of the proceedings. He then held that the circumstances of the case were exceptional within the Insolvency Act 1986 s.335A(3), declared that the property was held beneficially in equal shares by L and N, and ordered that it should be placed on the market for sale not earlier than 18 months from the date of the order. On the application for permission to appeal the judge made it clear that even if he had had jurisdiction to make an order in line with the offer, he would have exercised his discretion not to make it. N argued that the judge had not approached the balancing exercise correctly when considering his discretion to make the order, particularly in relation to the fact that the creditors&#8217; interests had been given too much weight as there was no evidence as to their identity or their debts.</p><p>N argued that the judge had not approached the balancing exercise correctly when considering his discretion to make the order, particularly in relation to the fact that the creditors&#8217; interests had been given too much weight as there was no evidence as to their identity or their debts.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that (1) the judge&#8217;s conclusion that he could not make an order on the terms of the offer was wrong, as he did have jurisdiction to make such an order. However, the balancing exercise carried out by the judge under s.335A(2) of the 1986 Act had been conducted correctly and the order for sale would not be set aside. (2) The criteria of exceptional circumstances in s.335A(3) did not cause N any difficulty, as she had met it. In the instant circumstances s.335A(3) operated by requiring the court to perform a balancing exercise and to decide what was just and reasonable. Amongst the circumstances that were to be taken into account were the creditors&#8217; interests. The test in s.335A was not inconsistent with the qualified nature of the rights in the Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8 and Sch.1 Part II Art.1, Jackson v Bell [2001] EWCA Civ 387, [2001] B.P.I.R. 612 considered. The whole purpose of s.335A(2)(b) was to identify the need to respect the home, not as an absolute objective to be guaranteed in every case but as a consideration in a balancing exercise. (3) While the 1986 Act provided that creditors&#8217; interests were to be taken into account, in an exceptional case such as the instant it did not prescribe the weight to be given to those interests but did require the court to make an order that was fair and reasonable. Where there was little evidence as to the identity of creditors and their concerns, it was not necessary for a trustee to do very much by way of positive evidence as to those interests. The judge had a statement of indebtedness before him and concluded that in the circumstances of the instant case he could not justify denying the creditors access to the asset while N retained an interest in the other property.</div></div> </div>

If the court thinks it proper to give one party or the other the right to reside in the house after the marriage is over, it is not then necessarily interfering with the equal division of property held in equal shares. If there is other property to be divided, an overall equality may be reached; or if there is not, the necessary adjustment may be made in the settlement of alimony or maintenance&#8221;.</div></div> </div>

In October 1977, Bleak House was purchased for GBP 34,000. Mr. and Mrs. Flegg provided GBP 18,000 of the purchase price. The remainder was provided by their son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell-Brown. It was necessary for the M-Bs to mortgage the house to the Hastings and Thanet Building Society to raise their contribution. In consequence, the house was transferred to Mr. and Mrs. M-B upon trust for sale as joint tenants. The house was in fact held by Mr. and Mrs. M-B on trust for sale and to stand possessed of the net proceeds of sale and rents and profits until sale upon trust for Mr. and Mrs. M-B and Mr. and Mrs. F as tenants in common in the proportions which they had contributed to the purchase price. From that time, Mr. and Mrs. M-B and Mr. and Mrs. F occupied the property in common. In January 1982, Mr. and Mrs. M-B executed a charge of the house in favour of the City of London Building Society to secure a loan of GBP 37,500. Mr. and Mrs. M-B used the money to discharge the existing mortgage and a number of other charges. Mr. and Mrs. M-B defaulted and the Building Society sought an order for possession of the house which was granted at first instance. On Mr. and Mrs. F&#8217;s appeal, the Court of Appeal held applying Williams &amp; Glyn&#8217;s Bank Ltd v Boland [1981] A.C. 487 , that Mr. and Mrs. F had an overriding interest in the house so that the Building Society&#8217;s charge was subject to their interest.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the Building Society&#8217;s appeal, that Mr. and Mrs. F&#8217;s interest was that of a beneficiary under a trust for sale. The advancement of capital moneys by the Building Society to Mr. and Mrs. M-B, being an advancement to two trustees, overreached Mr. and Mrs. F&#8217;s interest. Their interest transferred to the capital moneys in the hands of Mr. and Mrs. M-B and the equity of redemption. The enjoyment of occupation of the property did not give rise to any separate or severable right from those enjoyed under the trust for sale. the Law of Property Act 1925 S.14 could not enlarge or add to Mr. and Mrs. F&#8217;s interest; it could not create an interest in the nature of a right to occupy the property that survived the execution of the trust for sale. Upon the execution of the trust for sale, any rights in reference to the house ceased to subsist within the meaning of the Land Registration Act 1925 s.70(1)(g) ; there was no longer a right for the time being subsisting. Accordingly, there was nothing in s.70(1)(g) that had the effect of preserving any rights of Mr. and Mrs. F to occupy the house against the Building Society&#8217;s. In Williams and Glyn&#8217;s Bank v Boland, the beneficiary&#8217;s rights were not overreached because payment was not made to two trustees as required by s.27 Law of Property Act 1925. The same did not apply in the present case ( Williams &amp; Glyn&#8217;s Bank Ltd v Boland [1981] A.C. 487 distinguished; Bull v Bull [1955] 1 Q.B. 234 , National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth [1965] A.C. 1175 , Irani Finance Ltd v Singh [1971] Ch. 59 considered).</div></div> </div>

However, a person claiming an overriding interest by virtue of actual occupation had to be in actual occupation at the time of the creation or transfer of the legal estate. In May 1984 D1 applied to P for a loan to be secured by a mortgage of a leasehold house which he proposed to buy, stating that the property, which was registered land, was for his sole occupation. In fact he intended it to be occupied by his mother, D2, and D3, who was to become her husband. P made a formal offer of loan which D1 accepted, contracts were exchanged on July 19, 1984, the completion being fixed for August 13. On August 6, P put a cheque for the loan in the hands of D1&#8217;s solicitors, and prior to August 13, D1 executed a legal charge in favour of P to secure the sum loaned. On August 13, completion of the purchase took place and the charge was executed. D2 and D3 then occupied the property. On September 13, 1984 D1 was registered as sole proprietor and P as proprietors of the charge. D1 then defaulted and P commenced proceedings against him and D2 and D3. D1 took no part in the proceedings and D2 and D3 claimed that because of D2&#8217;s contribution to the purchase price and an assurance by D1 that she would always have a roof over her head, D2 had equitable interest that by virtue of her actual occupation had taken priority over P&#8217;s charge and was binding on P as an overriding interest pursuant to the Land Registration Act 1925 ss.23(1) and 70(1)(g) . The judge made an order for possession and the Court of Appeal dismissed D2 and D3&#8217;s appeal.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing D2 and D3&#8217;s appeals to the House of Lords, that (1) the relevant date for determining the existence of overriding interests was the date of the registration of the estate, not the date when the estate was transferred or created, Lloyds Bank Plc v Rosset [1989] Ch. 350 approved and Boyle&#8217;s Claim, Re [1961] 1 W.L.R. 339 distinguished; (2) however, to substantiate a claim to an overriding interest against a transferee or chargee under s.70(1)(g) as a person in actual occupation of the land, the person claiming the overriding interest had to have been in actual occupation at the time of creation or transfer of the legal estate; (3) where a purchaser relied on a loan to complete his purchase, the transaction of acquiring the legal estate and granting the charge was one indivisible transaction, at least where there had been a prior agreement to grant the charge on the legal estate when acquired. The purchaser at no time acquired the estate free of charge, and so D2 had no overriding interest arising from actual occupation by moving in carpets for some 35 minutes before the time of completion, Connolly Bros Ltd (No.2), Re [1912] 2 Ch. 25 and Coventry Permanent Economic Building Society v Jones [1951] 1 All E.R. 901 approved; Security Trust Co v Royal Bank of Canada [1976] A.C. 503 applied and Church of England Building Society v Piskor [1954] Ch. 553 overruled and (4) the judge was entitled to find that the acts of D2 and D3 on the day of completion were merely preparatory, leading to actual residential occupation only after completion. &#8220;Actual occupation&#8221; involved some degree of permanence or continuity and acts of a preparatory nature, carried out by courtesy of the vendor, could not constitute actual occupation under s.70(1)(g). Moreover, the Court of Appeal was entitled to conclude that D2 had impliedly authorised D1 to obtain the mortgage so as to preclude her from relying on any interest as prevailing over that of P.</div></div> </div>

The contracts of sale provided that the properties were sold with full title guarantee and vacant possession, and the vendors had no equitable rights over the properties.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeals dismissed.<p>(1) The correct approach was to first analyse the true commercial and legal nature of the transactions between X and N. Objectively appraised, there were two separate transactions; one for the sale of the freehold and one for a leaseback to X upon completion. The contracts for sale provided expressly that the property was sold with full title guarantee and with vacant possession, they made no reference to the grant of a lease to X on completion. The clear impression created by the contracts was that X would be selling without reserving any beneficial interests, or other rights in the properties. That was how M was entitled to view the matter. The contracts disclosed no basis for a qualified report on title to M by their solicitors which would have alerted M to the possibility that X expected to remain in possession after completion, or that N would obtain anything less than the entire legal and beneficial interest in the properties. In those circumstances, no equitable interest, or equivalent equity, could have arisen in X&#8217;s favour prior to completion, Sargaison v Roberts [1969] 1 W.L.R. 951 considered. Even if an equity arose in favour of X immediately upon exchange of contracts, in consequence of N&#8217;s assurances, there was no moment of time when the freehold acquired by N was free from the mortgage but subject to the equity as the contract for sale was exchanged and the transfer and mortgage were executed on the same day, Nationwide Anglia Building Society v Ahmed and Balakrishnan (1995) 70 P. &amp; C.R. 381 and Abbey National Building Society v Cann [1991] 1 A.C. 56 applied. The principle in the case of Cann was directly applicable and it would not be appropriate, as a matter of policy, to place on M the risk of carelessness or fraud in the carrying out of the promises or representations made to X because M could have, and should have, made direct enquiries of X (see paras 34-37, 56 of judgment). (2) Prior to the registration of the transfer the grant of any lease by N took effect only in equity and did not fall within the Land Registration Act 2002 s.29 (para.58). (3) The problems that had arisen for X would have been avoided if the contracts for sale had given details of the entire contractual deal between X and N, and the precise contractual arrangements that were to operate in relation to X&#8217;s occupation after completion would have been clearly stated. Further, M&#8217;s solicitors would have been bound to report those contractual arrangements to M, which would then have been in a position to decide whether or not to make a loan in light of those arrangements. If the arrangements were intended to be binding on any third party as well as N their omission appeared, on the face of it, inconsistent with proper conveyancing practice (para.67).</p></div></div> </div>

In 1978 H and W bought a house as joint tenants. In 1979 H, pretending that he was acting on behalf of himself and W, obtained a loan from FNS and charged the house as security, forging W&#8217;s signature on both application and charge. In 1980 FNS obtained judgment in default against H, who had left the country, and subsequently obtained ex parte a charging order nisi over H&#8217;s interest in the house.

W, who was suffering from a terminal illness, was considering divorce and, so that the whole legal and beneficial ownership of the property would not vest in H on her death, decided to serve a notice severing the joint tenancy which, under the proviso to the Law of Property Act 1925 s.36(2), would have the effect that the legal title would vest in H on W&#8217;s death but he would hold the beneficial interest on trust in equal shares for himself and on the trusts of W&#8217;s will. The notice was signed by W and sent to H at the matrimonial home by ordinary first class post. H, having been admitted to hospital after being taken ill suddenly, was not at home to receive the notice and W, thinking that H might predecease her and having changed her mind about wanting to sever the tenancy, destroyed it. H died a week later and W several months later. H&#8217;s executors, seeking a declaration that they were entitled to a one half beneficial share of the property or the proceeds of sale, issued proceedings against W&#8217;s executors, contending that the notice of severance was validly served in terms of s.196(3) of the Act and was therefore effective to sever the joint tenancy.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; that H&#8217;s executors were entitled to the declaration.

There was nothing in s.36(2) which required a court to inquire into the sender&#8217;s state of mind and it made no difference that, at the time of service, W no longer wished to sever the tenancy.

M&#8217;s acceptance that D was entitled to a half share in the property would have been reasonably understood by Q, or any other person upon whom the application was served, as a present, unconditional and unambiguous notice to sever, Harris v Goddard [1983] 1 W.L.R. 1203 considered. The application was not served on D in any of the ways permitted under s.196. However, the position changed when the court ordered that Q should be made D&#8217;s deputy for his affairs. It was right to regard Q as having sufficient authority to receive a notice of severance on D&#8217;s behalf from the time she was appointed deputy and since she knew of M&#8217;s application the notice could and should be treated as having been given to her for the purposes of s.36(2) (see paras 33-35 of judgment)</p><p></p><p></p></div></div> </div>

It was clear that a joint tenancy could survive a proposal and an agreement to put a property on the market and a subject to contract offer; even an eventual sale could be compliant with a joint tenancy continuing to exist, Marshall v Marshall applied. However, in the instant case, it was apparent from the correspondence between M and S that the parties had a common intention that the property be sold and that the proceeds be divided equally, albeit with balancing payments being made to M to reflect the fact that S had received the benefit of the sale of the policy. Cognizance had to be given to the fact that both M and S had been advised by solicitors, that both knew that the other was being advised by solicitors and that they both knew that having been married so long equal division of their assets was inevitable. Further, the only source for the balancing payment to M was from the sale of the property. Moreover, the parties had embarked upon the division of their assets on the basis that their assets would be divided equally. Accordingly, the judge had reached the right conclusion on the severance of the property, Burgess and Marshall applied. (2) Evidence pertaining to what parties wished to do, what they intended to do and what they were advised by their solicitors was irrelevant to the issue at hand. The court should concentrate on what passed between the parties by way of words and actions and what they knew. It should not normally consider what was communicated between a party and their solicitor (paras 22-23).</p></div></div> </div>

In Taylor&#8217;s case the landlord had arrived on the scene after the work had been done and it was not possible to say that the works would not have been done had the tenant known that the option was void: specific performance refused. In Old&#8217;s case the landlord had encouraged the tenant to carry out works, to take another lease of adjoining premises and had fixed the value of the freehold with the burden of the option: specific performance granted.

The court held that on the facts of the case, the repeated assurances made by H were capable of constituting an enforceable claim for proprietary estoppel, and that G had acted to his detriment in reliance on those assurances.</p><p>G, who was then aged 12, met H, a wealthy landowner, in 1952 and a close friendship developed between the two. At the age of 15, G left school and began to work for H on a full time basis. Although it was initially intended that G should attend agricultural college, this idea was later abandoned as H persuaded G that he could learn more if he continued to work for him. G met S whom he subsequently married. Prior to the marriage, G and S were taken out for a meal by H during which H stated that G would eventually take over the running of the farm and that on his death, the entire business would be left to G. At the christening of G&#8217;s first child, H stated that the child&#8217;s birth would enable the farm to continue through to the next generation. Further assurances were made over subsequent years. In 1992, H met W. A relationship developed between them, and by 1994 W had taken the place of G as the principal beneficiary of H&#8217;s will. H initiated a police investigation into G&#8217;s management of the accounts relating to the farm business and other associated businesses which G was by then involved with. As a result of the investigation, G and S were the subject of disciplinary proceedings and thereafter summarily dismissed. G issued proceedings against H and W seeking equitable relief on the basis of proprietary estoppel. The judge held ([1998] 3 All E.R. 917) that whilst G&#8217;s evidence in relation to the assurances made by H was true, there had nevertheless been no assurance from H capable of amounting to an irrevocable promise that G would inherit his estate despite subsequent changes in circumstances, and the claim therefore failed. The court also held that there was insufficient evidence of detriment. G appealed.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that (1) the fact that a testamentary disposition was always capable of revocation could not defeat a promise of the kind made by H, whereby he had effectively assured G that &#8220;all this will be yours&#8221;, Taylor v Dickens [1998] 1 F.L.R. 806 considered. On the facts, it was intended that G should rely on the assurances given and they were clearly relied on. Reliance would in any event be presumed, Greasley v Cooke [1980] 1 W.L.R. 1306 referred to. The judge had misdirected himself with regard to the necessary elements of proprietary estoppel. In particular he had exaggerated the extent to which a promise had to be expressly irrevocable in order to give rise to an estoppel, and had further erred in suggesting that there had been a need to find a definite agreement as per the doctrine of mutual wills, and (2) G&#8217;s case on detriment was compelling. He had left school in the face of opposition from his headmaster and concern from his parents to work for a much older man who had influenced both his social and his working life. In effect, for a period exceeding 30 years, G and his family had acted as a surrogate family to H. In many ways G had been denied the opportunity of bettering himself in reliance on H&#8217;s oft repeated assurances, and in those circumstances detriment had clearly been established.</div></div> </div>

The judge&#8217;s findings of fact had not been open to challenge in the Court of Appeal and there had been insufficient reason for that court to reverse them. The court considered the operation of proprietary estoppel generally and the necessary character or qualities that an assurance must have in order to be relied upon as proprietary estoppel.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>(1) To establish a proprietary estoppel, the relevant assurance had to be clear enough. What amounted to sufficient clarity depended on context, Walton v Walton (Unreported) April 14, 1994applied. There was some authority for the view that the &#8220;clear and unequivocal&#8221; test did not apply to proprietary estoppel, especially in Treitel, Law of Contract (12th edn. 2007) and at least the two earlier editions, and in Jones v Watkins (Unreported) November 26, 1987, Jones applied. There was a degree of unreality in making a distinction between the meaning of written words and the meaning of spoken words because in cases of the instant type, a judge&#8217;s conclusion as to the meaning of spoken words would be inextricably entangled with his factual findings about the surrounding circumstances. In the instant case, the Court of Appeal had concentrated too much on the significance of the 1990 incident regarding the bonus notices and had not given sufficient weight to the advantage that the trial judge had had in seeing and hearing the witnesses. The 1990 incident had marked the transition from hope to expectation, but it had not stood alone, and the evidence had demonstrated a continuing pattern of conduct by P for the remaining 15 years of his life. It was not helpful to try to break that pattern down into discrete elements. There had been insufficient reason for the Court of Appeal to reverse the trial judge&#8217;s careful findings and conclusion. (2) Proprietary estoppel had to relate to identified property (usually land) owned or about to be owned by the defendant. The trial judge had made a clear finding of an assurance by P that D would become entitled to the farm. Both P and D knew that the extent of the farm was liable to fluctuate as development opportunities arose and tenancies came and went. There was no reason to doubt that their common understanding had been that P&#8217;s assurance related to whatever the farm consisted of at P&#8217;s death, Walton applied and Layton v Martin [1986] 2 F.L.R. 227 and Basham (Deceased), Re [1986] 1 W.L.R. 1498 considered. There was no ground on which to challenge the trial judge&#8217;s discretion in determining the remedy and his order was to be restored, Gillett v Holt [2001] Ch. 210, Crabb v Arun DC [1976] Ch. 179 and Cobbe v Yeoman&#8217;s Row Management Ltd [2008] UKHL 55, [2008] 1 W.L.R. 1752 considered.</p></div></div> </div>

The claimants had to show that they had relied on the alleged agreement, arrangement or understanding. Typically that would be by staying out of the market themselves, or by committing expenditure that they would not otherwise had committed, but on any view their activity or inactivity had to be referable to the consensus on which they relied, Cobbe v Yeoman&#8217;s Row Management Ltd [2008] UKHL 55, [2008] 1 W.L.R. 1752 and Thorner v Major [2009] UKHL 18, [2009] 1 W.L.R. 776 applied. (2) The consensus reached in the first meeting between the residents did not bind C&#8217;s conscience in the acquisition of the amenity land as it was of the nature of an informal agreement between neighbours as to how to proceed concerning E&#8217;s removal, rather than an agreement intended to give rise to legal consequences between themselves. It could not be said that the consensus of that meeting continued to bind B&#8217;s conscience when C purchased the amenity land. E had rejected the residents&#8217; proposal to transfer the amenity land to their incorporated management company, which could suggest that any earlier agreement between the residents had come to an end. B also remained inactive concerning the amenity land, and did nothing to indicate that they were relying on an agreement from the first meeting. C had gained the impression that B intended to move away from the estate in the short term, and it was common ground that B had put their house on the market. Accordingly, it was clear that B had placed no reliance on any earlier agreement and they had not, therefore, made out their claim to a constructive trust of the amenity land.</p></div></div> </div>

There was a distinction to be drawn between commercial and domestic cases, Cobbe and Thorner v Major [2009] UKHL 18, [2009] 1 W.L.R. 776 considered. It was the nature of the parties&#8217; dealings, and not the nature of the property, which determined whether a case should be regarded as commercial or domestic. The judge had been correct to classify the instant case as commercial (see paras 24-32 of judgment). (2) There was no binding authority that answered the issue of whether the assurances given to W by K would create a proprietary estoppel or constructive trust in her favour despite the parties signing a contract of sale that did not mention them. Such clams were fact-sensitive, Thorner v Major , Herbert v Doyle [2010] EWCA Civ 1095, [2011] 1 E.G.L.R. 119 and Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 A.C. 432 followed. In the instant case the facts were not sufficiently clear to make a summary determination on the documents.

The defendant took possession of the Leeds property from November 2011 and directed the Leeds tenant to pay the claimant rent. The tenant paid the claimant rent for six months and thereafter made rent payments to the defendant; the claimant had not made any council tax payments for the Leeds property. In relation to the Tehran property, it had been validly transferred and registered to the defendant in November 2011, the claimant had given the defendant two cheques totalling 500 million IR, although they were later stolen, the claimant&#8217;s solicitor had made an unconditional offer to pay the defendant 400 million IR and steps had been taken to evict the Tehran tenant. (2) There was no illegality arising out of the fact that the parties agreed that the defendant had received £100,000 for the transfer of the Leeds property. Even if there had been, it would not have been sufficient to defeat the constructive trust/proprietary estoppel claim. The claimant&#8217;s solicitor had not breached his professional obligations to the defendant, and he had advised the defendant to seek advice (see paras 182-184 of judgment). Despite Cobbe v Yeoman&#8217;s Row Management Ltd [2008] UKHL 55, [2008] 1 W.L.R. 1752, it was still probably possible to have a proprietary estoppel in the case of a contract that did not satisfy the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 s.2, but that would be an exceptional case, Cobbe considered. In the exceptional circumstances of the instant case, it would be unconscionable for the defendant to refuse to complete the transfer of the Leeds property to the claimant. The claimant had made out his claim for a constructive trust and/or a proprietary estoppel. The appropriate relief was to put the parties in the position that they would have been in had the contract been concluded in November 2011, namely the Leeds property would have been transferred to the claimant; he would have received rents and been liable for council tax/business rates for the first floor; he would have remained liable to pay the defendant 400 million IR; the Leeds property would have been transferred to him, and he would have been able to increase the rent. Taking all matters into account, the loss of rental income was sufficient to satisfy the loss of 400 million IR and any council tax paid or payable by the defendant in respect of the first floor flat since November 2011. Accordingly, the Leeds property would be transferred to the claimant and he would receive any further rent payable by the tenant (187-201 of judgment).</p><p></p></div></div> </div>

She had not suggested the same until after notice to quit had been served and previously had relied on the terms of the memorandum on several occasions. Further, the evidence did not establish that P&#8217;s permission had been required for S and L to stay at the property and the actual occupation of the property did not support the contention that P had exclusive possession. There was no documentary evidence to support the alleged oral agreement. The accountant had not referred to it in an affidavit made in connection with the earlier disputes about P&#8217;s occupation. On the balance of probabilities, the only representation made to P was the one contained in the memorandum.

It was clear that D had made the gift because he feared that he was not likely to live until V&#8217;s next visit. The question was not whether D had had good grounds to anticipate his demise, nor whether his death occurred as quickly as he might have feared, but whether the motive for the gift was that he subjectively contemplated the possibility of death in the near future. The fact that D thought he might die before V&#8217;s next visit was &#8220;the near future&#8221;. The doctrine only required the gift to be made in &#8220;contemplation&#8221; of death, not in &#8220;expectation&#8221; of it. Lack of opportunity by a deceased to make a will was not something which a donee had to prove in modern times; that was best regarded as justification for the doctrine rather than as a precondition for its operation (see paras 14-15, 24-27 of judgment). (2) In order for donatio mortis causa to be effective, there had to be an overt act of physical transfer. &#8220;Dominion&#8221; connoted conditional ownership. In the context of chattels, it was interchangeable with &#8220;possession&#8221;. In the case of intangible items of property which could not be physically delivered, the concept of dominion was slippery. Its fundamental rationale was that something must be done by way of delivery sufficient to indicate that a conditional gift was intended: something amounting to a &#8220;parting with dominion&#8221;. Sen was the only reported case where a valid donatio of land had been found. Although the facts of that case were distinguishable from those of the instant case, the principle in Sen was that land was to be treated in the same way as a chose in action; the delivery of title deeds would usually be enough to constitute delivery of dominion unless there was evidence that the donor had reserved power to deal with the land in a manner that was incompatible with the gift. There was no reason why a donor&#8217;s continued enjoyment of the property was to be regarded as incompatible with an intention to make a gift as, under the doctrine, the gift only became effective upon death. In the instant case, D&#8217;s delivery of the deeds to V meant that he had no power to transfer the house elsewhere, and the handing over of the keys diminished his control over it; there had been sufficient delivery of dominion to constitute a valid donatio mortis causa , Craven&#8217;s Estate (No.1), Re [1937] Ch. 423 and Ward v Turner 28 E.R. 275 considered, Wasserberg, Re [1915] 1 Ch. 195 and Sen applied (paras 21-22, 29, 32-43). (3) The judge&#8217;s reasons for making the costs order were adequate justification. While B had been torn between V&#8217;s claim to the only worthwhile asset of the estate and his duty to D&#8217;s brother, the situation had been of his own making, in the hope of personal financial gain. That fact should be reflected in the costs (paras 44-56).</p></div></div> </div>

It had failed to weigh any disadvantages suffered by the claimant by reason of his reliance on the promise against any countervailing advantages which he had enjoyed by reason of that reliance.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed<p>Appeal allowed. (1) Even though the concepts of reliance and detriment could be regarded, in the abstract, as different, in applying the principles of proprietary estoppel they were often intertwined, Gillett v Holt [2001] Ch. 210 applied, Steria cited. The two concepts were intertwined in the instant case. The judge had misdirected himself on the issue of detriment by failing to weigh the disadvantages suffered by C against the countervailing advantages which he enjoyed as a result of G&#8217;s promises, Jennings v Rice [2002] EWCA Civ 159, [2003] 1 F.C.R. 501 and Campbell v Griffin [2001] EWCA Civ 990, [2001] W.T.L.R. 981 applied. The Court of Appeal had also approached the issue of detriment erroneously, as demonstrated by its finding that the judge had erred in attempting to compare the advantage with the detriment. Therefore, the question of detriment had to be considered afresh. It was clear from the evidence that, by remaining on the land, C had deprived himself of the opportunity of a better life elsewhere. That detriment had not been outweighed by the advantages C enjoyed as a result of remaining on the land. Accordingly, an equity had arisen in C&#8217;s favour under the doctrine of proprietary estoppel in respect of the land. (2) It was possible that cases might arise in which the circumstances surrounding a third party purchase might, notwithstanding the claimant&#8217;s overriding interest, require the court to reassess the extent of the claimant&#8217;s equity in the property. However, T&#8217;s case contained no plea to that effect, nor was any such case pursued on her behalf at trial, so the issue did not arise. (3) In determining the extent of the equity in C&#8217;s favour, the Court of Appeal had erred in stating that it had no power to say that the promise, and the resulting benefit, was disproportionate to the detriment. Proportionality was at the heart of the doctrine of proprietary estoppel, and it permeated its every application. In the circumstances, the appropriate relief was to award C one half of the plot of land.</p></div></div> </div>

But if the circumstances and the conduct of the parties show that all that was intended was that the occupier should be granted a personal privilege with no interest in the land, he will be held only to be a licensee&#8221;: per Denning, L.J. In 1936 a father bought a house for his son and daughter-in-law to live in. The father put down GBP 250 in cash and borrowed GBP 500 from a building society on the security of the house, repayable with interest by instalments of 15s. a week. He took the house in his own name and made himself responsible for the instalments. The father told the daughter-in-law that the GBP 250 was a present for them, but he left them to pay the building society instalments of 15s. a week themselves. He handed the building society book to the daughter-in-law and said to her: &#8220;Don&#8217;t part with this book. The house will be your property when the mortgage is paid.&#8221; He said that when he retired he would transfer it into their names. The daughter-in-law paid the instalments regularly from that date onwards with the result that much of the mortgage had been repaid. The father, on being informed that the couple could not pay the rates, paid those also. In 1945 the father died leaving the house to his widow. Soon after, the son left his wife. The widow sued her daughter-in-law for possession of the house. Held, (1) there was no tenancy at will as the father could not revoke his promise once the couple entered on performance of the act: his promise would only cease to bind him if they left it incomplete and unperformed, which they had not done; (2) the 15s. which the couple paid was not rent as they were not bound to pay it: the father could not sue for it or distrain for it; he could only refuse to transfer the house to them; (3) the couple were licensees, having a permissive occupation short of a tenancy, but with a contractual right or, at any rate, an equitable right to remain so long as they paid the instalments, which would grow into a good equitable title to the house itself as soon as the mortgage was paid.

The section is not confined to rights which, as a matter of law, were so annexed or appurtenant to the property conveyed at the time of the conveyance as to make them actual legally enforceable rights. Thus, on severance of a piece of land in common ownership, the quasi easements de facto enjoyed in respect of it by one part of the land over another will pass although, of course, as a matter of law, no man can have a right appendant or appurtenant to one part of his property exercisable by him over the other part of his property. 2. The right, in order to pass, need not be one to which the owner or occupier for the time being of the land has had what may be described as a permanent title. A right enjoyed merely by permission is enough. 3. For the purposes of s.62 it is only necessary that the right should be one capable of being granted at law, or, in other words, a right known to the law. If it is a right of that description, it matters not that it has been, in fact, enjoyed by permission only. 4. The provisions of s.62 cannot apply where in the circumstances of the case there can have been no expectation by the parties that the enjoyment of the right could be other than temporary. In 1941, Mrs. W. was a statutory tenant of two rooms on the top floor of the defendant&#8217;s house, and, by permission separately granted, was using a shed in the garden for the storage of her coal. In 1943, the defendant granted to Mrs. W. and her daughter, the plaintiffs in the action, a new tenancy of the upper flat, including an additional room. The tenancy agreement contained no reference to the coal shed, nor any indication of intention one way or the other whether the plaintiffs were to continue to enjoy the use of the coal shed. A dispute arose between the parties about the plaintiffs&#8217; right to use the coal shed. Held, the fact that Mrs. W. used the coal shed by permission of the defendant could not prevent s.62 from applying. The right to use the coal shed for the purpose of storing such coal as might be required for domestic purposes was a right or easement which the law would recognise. It could not be said that it was in the contemplation of the parties that the enjoyment of the right should be purely temporary.

The conveyance for M&#8217;s cottage had included a right of way over the disputed land. M had contended however that the right was more extensive by reason of use of the land over years. M had tended a garden on the land which included a grassed area and a flower bed. M had returned home one day to find that G, exercising what they believed to be their right over the land, had removed the flower bed in a bid to create a driveway across the land. M had commenced proceedings for, and was granted, a declaration that she was entitled to freehold rights over the land. G&#8217;s subsequent appeal was dismissed on the grounds that the facts of the case were sufficient to found an easement known to law. G argued that the easement was so wide as to be tantamount to a claim to use the land to the exclusion of the trustees, and was an attempt to pass off a claim for adverse possession, which could not succeed because of the communal use of the land, as a claim for an easement.

Although G had not created or maintained the communal garden, the land had been used as such since the sale of the cottages. G had been content to allow the owners of the cottages to determine the layout of the garden and maintain it, facts which did not derogate from the conclusion that the trustees had been prepared to set aside the land for use as a communal garden. The declaration granted in favour of M went beyond what was necessary to reflect the right which had been established on the evidence. The restriction on the trustees could only be insofar as was necessary to ensure that the rights of M to use the land as a communal garden for recreational and amenity purposes were protected. In removing M&#8217;s flower bed without notice, G interfered with M&#8217;s rights. However, they were entitled to create a driveway over the land, as it would not necessarily interfere with the rights to use the land as a communal garden, but in carrying out works on the land, G had to ensure that the use of the land as a communal garden for recreational and amenity purposes was maintained.</div></div> </div>

By the time he issued his claim form the gates had been removed and the offending parking had ceased. If there were any matters that still required determination the proper course would have been for him to have brought the matter back to court by way of application in the earlier action. It was long-established law that an action for disturbance of a right of way would not lie unless there was a real and substantial interference with its enjoyment having regard to the terms of the express grant. On the facts of the case, both the existence of the gates and the parking of cars in the passageway could constitute a substantial interference with W&#8217;s right of way. Until the removal of the western gate two days before W issued his claim form, he was clearly unable to exercise his vehicular right over the passageway. However, that had to be seen in the context of the fact that in recognising that W had a right of way over the passageway, the Court of Appeal indicated that it was not a right to use it for purposes for which he had a more, or equally, convenient access. While that observation could not stand following the decision in Brooks v Young [2008] EWCA Civ 816, [2008] 3 E.G.L.R. 27, C might for some time have been labouring under a genuine misapprehension as to the extent of W&#8217;s rights, Young referred to. That misapprehension had since been dispelled and C had satisfied the court that they did not intend to obstruct W&#8217;s right of way in the future. There was no ongoing obstruction to W&#8217;s exercise of his right of way and he had not made out any case of sufficient prior obstruction to sound in damages for inconvenience.</p></div></div> </div>

(2) The express grant of a right of access had to be construed in the light of the circumstances that existed when it was granted in 1973, but it was not necessary for it to be shown that all the rights that were later claimed as necessary for the comfortable use and enjoyment of the servitude were actually in use at that date. It was sufficient that they might be considered to have been in contemplation at the time of the grant, having regard to what the dominant proprietor might reasonably be expected to do in the exercise of his right to convenient and comfortable use of the property, Ewart v Cochrane (1861) 4 Macq. 117 considered. In the particular and unusual circumstances of the instant case, the rights ancillary to the express grant of a right of access in favour of the dominant tenement included a right to park vehicles on the servient tenement, in so far as that was reasonably incidental to the enjoyment of the dominant tenement.

Had C sought permission to amend the plan to mark on the gravelled area, the adjudicator could not have refused permission. Therefore, the adjudicator was right to consider the ouster issue in relation to the gravelled area as well as the yellow land. Moreover, even though the yellow land was marked on the plan the evidence had not discriminated between it and the gravelled area. In any event, if the gravelled area had been delineated on the plan the evidence presented would not have been any different and as the adjudicator considered both plots of land it would have been artificial and unjust to limit consideration to the yellow land only. (2) It could not be said that depriving V of the ability to park on the gravelled area amounted to denying her a reasonable use of the servient land. The part of the land that was within V&#8217;s ownership was not sufficient to park a car on and in order to do so she would have to trespass on the adjoining unregistered owner&#8217;s land to park on the gravelled area. A user that could only be sensibly effected by trespassing on adjoining land did not amount to a reasonable use of the servient land, and depriving V of that right did not render her ownership of the servient land illusory. The adjudicator had been wrong to accept that the test of user in Batchelor v Marlow [2001] EWCA Civ 1051, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 764 had been modified to one of possession and control by Moncrieff v Jamieson [2007] UKHL 42, [2007] 1 W.L.R. 2620, Moncrieff considered. While Moncrieff criticised the strict test of user in Batchelor it had not overruled it, and therefore Batchelor remained binding. However, the present case was distinguishable on the facts as the parking space was adjacent to V&#8217;s property and she had the ability to alter the surface for aesthetic reasons. The adjudicator had correctly noted that V was still able to maintain the part of the land that she owned and deal with it as the owner in that she had the ability to alter the surface of the land, maintain her fence, and plantage providing they did not interfere with the parking. None of those users of land could be dismissed as insignificant or illusory, Batchelor distinguished. In addition the adjudicator had had the benefit of hearing the witnesses and the advantage of a site view. Accordingly, the adjudicator had been right to conclude that easement was capable of existing in law and that the ouster principle did not apply.</p></div></div> </div>

Thus, the fact that M did not execute the 1989 transfer did not preclude D and X from arguing that the transfer impliedly reserved easements to D in relation to the retained land (see para.27 of judgment). (2) The test for implying an easement of necessity was a strict one. It was not enough to show that the easement was necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the land retained; the facts had to be such that the retained land could not be used at all without the implication of an easement, Union Lighterage Co v London Graving Dock Co [1902] 2 Ch. 557 and MRA Engineering Ltd v Trimster Co Ltd (1988) 56 P. &amp; C.R. 1 applied. In the instant case, there were no grounds on which to imply the reservation of a drainage easement on the basis of necessity because the absence of such an easement did not have much impact on the use that could be made of the retained part of the building and the yard, which were not self-contained parts (paras 32, 49). (3) The movement of effluent and other liquid began on the retained land. If the transfer had reserved a right to drain onto the land transferred, then the land transferred would have the burden of dealing with that effluent. However, if there were no reserved right of drainage, then the land transferred could refuse to accept effluent from the retained land. As it was far from clear that there would be an implied grant of a drainage easement in favour of the land transferred over the land retained, it was difficult for D and X to establish the case for an implied reservation of a drainage easement from the retained land onto the land transferred. The flow of effluent and other liquid onto the land transferred would be an obvious burden in excess of any arguable benefit. There was therefore no implied derogation from the express grant to M and no reason to hold that he took the land transferred in 1989 subject to the burden of being obliged to deal with effluent water from the land retained, Pyer v Carter 156 E.R. 1472 considered (paras 50-51, 56-58). (4) Given the factual findings in the instant case, it was not possible to hold that a drainage easement should be impliedly reserved to give effect to an intention that the retained land should be used in some definite and particular manner. It was therefore not possible to imply into the 1989 transfer the reservation of an easement of drainage in favour of the retained land (paras 59-60).</p></div></div> </div>

(1) Intended easements, like all other implied easements, were subject to the general rule that they were implied more readily in favour of a grantee than a grantor. Nevertheless, the parties had to intend that the subject of the grant should be used in some definite and particular manner. If the grantee could establish the requisite intention, the law would then imply the grant of such easements as might be necessary to give effect to it, Pwllbach Colliery applied. It was axiomatic that in construing any conveyance, the facts in reference to which it was made had to be taken into account. In the instant case, no extrinsic evidence had been adduced, so the court could only refer to the 1955 deed. The material question in the instant case was not how the land was enjoyed in 1955, but whether the parties to the deed had intended that it should be used in some definite and particular manner. The requirement that the parties should have intended a definite and particular use of the land did not require that the intention be proved as a certainty. It was enough that it was proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) The plan annexed to the deed could be relied upon for the purpose of establishing the parties&#8217; intention as to the use to which the land should be put. It was part of the material agreed on by the parties: there was no reason why their common intention, if it was not expressed, should not be implied from that as much as from any other part of the agreed material. The plan delineated, as the land conveyed, a plot adjoining two other similar-sized plots on which dwellings had already been constructed. On the balance of probabilities, the parties could only have intended that the land should be used for the construction of another dwelling to be used thereafter for residential purposes. No other intention could reasonably be imputed to them. The easements claimed by S and declared in their favour by the judge were necessary, and were no more than was necessary, to give effect to the intention so established.</p></div></div> </div>

K based his claim on two conveyances of plots of land that now formed part of The Paddock, which included easements providing a right of way over the land for the purpose of the roadway. One conveyance included an attached plan detailing the existing roadway and by means of a dotted line the proposed future line of road improvement leading to Lostock Hall Farm. The other conveyance included easements providing a right of way over an &#8220;intended road&#8221; to Lostock Hall Farm. No extension to the roadway occurred prior to 1989 when K began to construct an extension to the roadway. At first instance, K&#8217;s counterclaim was dismissed and K appealed, contending that, while neither of the conveyances contained an express reservation of the rights within them, on their true construction a reservation of those rights was to be implied and as successor in title K could therefore still benefit from the easements. C argued that even if an implied reservation existed, it was only exercisable within a reasonable time from the date of grant and on this basis the rights were unenforceable because a reasonable time had expired.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that (1) there was no clear evidence of a common intention at the time when the two conveyances were originally granted that the easements contained within them should be exercisable in perpetuity.

The transferee was granted an express right of way over the blue land for the use and enjoyment of the land and one such purpose was the laying of connections to utilities. Accordingly, if there was an easement of necessity allowing such connections to be laid or maintained, a right of way to facilitate it would already exist on the blue land. The proposed easement did not violate the inhibitions stated in the transfer (see paras 16-18 of judgment). (2) The amended defence had pleaded an inferred and implied easement of necessity. The blue land was undoubtedly intended for access to both properties. It was clear from the auction particulars that the purpose of the transfer was to enable the transferee to build a dwelling-house on the building plot. The suggestion that such a dwelling-house might sensibly be expected by the parties to be constructed without connections to the mains utilities was optimistic. The judge was right, applying Lord Parker&#8217;s second test in Pwllbach Colliery Co Ltd v Woodman [1915] A.C. 634, the parties must be taken to have intended that the building of a dwelling-house on the building plot would have included the connection to mains utility services across the obvious route of the blue land, Pwllbach and Stafford v Lee (1993) 65 P. &amp; C.R. 172 followed. The easement proposed was necessary to achieve the parties&#8217; expressly intended purpose. It was not seeking to manufacture a necessity out of what was merely reasonable or desirable (paras 26-29, 32-33). (3) The easement was to be implied into the transfer allowing the transferee and his successors in title access to the blue land to install and maintain connections to the public utility services in the road (para.34).</p></div></div> </div>

The defendant&#8217;s counterclaim for infringement of his right of way over the claimants&#8217; land was rejected since, although the right of way had been narrowed by the claimants&#8217; construction of a building, sufficient width remained for him to use it.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Judgment accordingly.<p>(1) On the proper construction of the original property transfers, a right of way was not a liberty, privilege or advantage &#8220;of a continuous nature&#8221;. Those words had to be given their established conveyancing meaning as excluding rights of way. The transfer to S did not, therefore, grant them the rights of way later claimed by C. Even if the phrase &#8220;of a continuous nature&#8221; was given some looser meaning, on the evidence there was no regular and frequent use of the claimed rights of way prior to the transfer (see paras 91-93 of judgment). (2) Section 62 could operate to create and easement or a right which did not previously exist because of unity of ownership before the relevant conveyance. There was no absolute rule that a right of way could not be claimed under s.62 where there had not been diversity of occupation before the relevant conveyance: a right of way could pass under s.62 without diversity of occupation, provided always that the right was continuous and apparent, Sovmots Investments Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment [1979] A.C. 144 considered, P&amp;S Platt Ltd v Crouch [2003] EWCA Civ 1110, [2004] 1 P. &amp; C.R. 18 and Alford v Hannaford [2011] EWCA Civ 1099, [2012] 1 P. &amp; C.R. DG2 followed. The ultimate question was whether the advantage claimed was, on the facts, &#8220;enjoyed with&#8221; the land conveyed. A consideration of how the land was actually used and whether it was apparently for the benefit of the land conveyed and apparently a burden on the land retained would be of great importance. There was no evidence that any of the four rights of way claimed by C had been enjoyed with the land conveyed. C were therefore unable to rely on s.62 to assert any rights of way (paras 110, 119, 128, 131, 133-138). (3) For an implied right of way to have arisen, C had to show that, at the date of the transfer to S, the rights claimed were (a) continuous and apparent in that they were enjoyed for the benefit of the land conveyed; (b) necessary for the reasonable and convenient enjoyment of the property conveyed; (c) not inconsistent with the conveyance&#8217;s express terms, Wheeldon followed. The requirement that the right claimed be necessary was an important qualification of the rule, Moncrieff v Jamieson [2007] UKHL 42, [2007] 1 W.L.R. 2620 followed. On the evidence, none of the rights of way claimed were necessary for the reasonable and convenient enjoyment of the land conveyed. Nor had S had a common intention as to a definite and particular use of the land which made it necessary for them to have any of the rights now claimed. No rights of way had been granted to C by implication (paras 144-145, 148, 151-154, 156, 162). (4) Simply to narrow an area over which there was a right of way would not necessarily involve an actionable interference with the right of way; the question was how much width was left. Notwithstanding C&#8217;s construction of a new building beside D&#8217;s right of way, there remained a sufficient width of track over which he could exercise his right so that it had not been substantially interfered with (paras 165, 176).</p></div></div> </div>

Such a right may be personal to the lessees qua lessees. The owner of a house agreed to let to tenants for two years from January 18, 1947, an annexe at the back of her house. Access to the annexe was permitted to the tenants through the house, though there was other access to it from waste land at the back. On July 10, 1947, the lease was executed. The landlord then let the house to another tenant, who purported to bar the access through it to the annexe.

(2) It was no defence for a defendant sued in nuisance to argue that the claimant came to the nuisance, although it might well be a defence, at least in some circumstances, for a defendant to argue that, as it was only because the claimant had changed the use of, or built on, his land that the defendant&#8217;s pre-existing activity was claimed to have become a nuisance, the claim should fail (para.58). (3) A defendant, faced with a contention that his activities gave rise to a nuisance, could rely on those activities as constituting part of the character of the locality, but only to the extent that they did not constitute a nuisance. Similarly, any other activity in the neighbourhood could properly be taken into account when assessing the character of the neighbourhood, to the extent that it did not give rise to an actionable nuisance or was otherwise unlawful (paras 74-75). (4) The mere fact that the activity which was said to give rise to the nuisance had the benefit of a planning permission would normally be of no assistance to the defendant in a claim brought by a neighbour who argued that the activity caused a nuisance to his land in the form of noise or other loss of amenity. Among other things, it was wrong in principle that, through the grant of a planning permission, a planning authority should be able to deprive a property-owner of a right to object to what would otherwise be a nuisance, without providing him with compensation, when there was no provision in the planning legislation which suggested such a possibility (paras 90, 94). (5) The court&#8217;s power to award damages in lieu of an injunction involved a classic exercise of discretion, which should not, as a matter of principle, be fettered, although the prima facie position was that an injunction should be granted. As to the four tests set out Shelfer v City of London Electric Lighting Co (No.1) [1895] 1 Ch. 287, their application should not be such as to fetter the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion. However, it would, in the absence of additional relevant circumstances pointing the other way, normally be right to refuse an injunction if those four tests were satisfied. But the fact that those tests were not all satisfied would not mean that an injunction should be granted, Shelfer considered. The public interest, if it arose, would be a relevant factor; for example, a court would be entitled to have regard to the fact that many other neighbours in addition to the claimant were badly affected by the nuisance as a factor in favour of granting an injunction. In some cases, the grant of planning permission for a particular activity might provide strong support for the contention that the activity was of benefit to the public, which would be relevant to the question of whether or not to grant an injunction (paras 120-121, 123-125). (6) The application of the above principles justified the restoration of the injunction granted by the judge at first instance. Among other things, C and M had not shown that their activities during a period of 20 years amounted to a nuisance. To justify the establishment of a right to create a noise by prescription, it was not enough to show that the activity which now created the noise had been carried on for 20 years. It was not even enough to show that the activity had created a noise for 20 years. What had to be established was that the activity had created a nuisance over 20 years. However, under the &#8220;permission to apply&#8221; provision in the judge&#8217;s order, C and M would be free to argue that the injunction should be discharged and damages awarded instead (paras 143, 148, 151).</p></div></div> </div>

Once the judge had identified that the objective of T was to graze his sheep both on the eastern field and on the adjoining field, and once he had identified what T actually did, which demonstrated that objective, and once he had correctly characterised those manoeuvres as a somewhat artificial device or expedient, then he was bound to conclude that T was in substance and intention using the driveway for the purpose of gaining access to the eastern field and the adjoining field as a single agricultural unit. That was not permitted by the right of way (see paras 20-21, 56-58 of judgment). (2) The meaning to be given to the word &#8220;temporary&#8221; was the meaning that the word had in the context of the conveyance containing the covenant. It did not have a single meaning in all legal contexts. The judge correctly recognised that the word was an ordinary English word containing within it a variety of nuances. He correctly held that whether a particular use or combination of uses was &#8220;temporary&#8221; was a question of fact and degree. His decision should not be disturbed (paras 28, 62).</p></div></div> </div>

However, it was possible to discern from the authorities two related aspects of public benefit. The first was that the nature of the purpose itself had to be such as to be a benefit to the community; the second was that those who might benefit from the carrying out of the purpose had to be sufficiently numerous and identified in such a manner as to constitute a section of the public, Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust Co Ltd [1951] A.C. 297 applied. A trust for the advancement of education was not necessarily for the public benefit, even if it was directed to a sufficiently wide section of the community. The terms of a particular trust had to be considered on a case-by-case basis, National Anti-Vivisection Society v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1948] A.C. 31 and Hetherington (Deceased), Re [1990] Ch. 1 considered (see paras 44-53, 62-71 of judgment). The provision of mainstream education in the schools concerned in the instant application was for the public benefit in the first sense. Whether that public benefit was outweighed by disbenefits arising from the charging of fees required a balancing exercise and in the instant case the material before the court had not displaced the conclusion that the nature of the education provided was for the public benefit (paras 94-113). However, the further question was whether the class of beneficiaries, those able to afford the fees, was a sufficient section of the community. A charitable organisation which in practice excluded poor people remained a charity; what it had to do was to make some provision for the poor to pass the de minimis hurdle and to provide more than a token benefit. On that basis, the guidance stating that a person&#8217;s exclusion because of an inability to pay would not have aims that were for the public benefit was wrong. If the guidance should not be read in that way, it was ambiguous and confusing and should be clarified. The guidance stating that there was a practical requirement that people who could not afford to pay had to be able to benefit in some other material way was obscure and problematic. The guidance required a level of benefit which the Commission considered to be reasonable and which went beyond that which was necessary. However, that was not a requirement. Although it was necessary that there be more than a token benefit, once that low threshold was reached, what the trustees decided to do in the running of a school was entirely up to them, subject to acting within the range within which trustees could properly act. That was entirely different from imposing on trustees anyone else&#8217;s view about what was reasonable. In some circumstances, it might be that the trustees would be acting properly if they provided a quite modest benefit for the poor in excess of the de minimis level. The public benefit requirement would then be fulfilled. The Commission&#8217;s error was to view the public benefit test as satisfied if, and only if, the provision for the poor was reasonable. It was not a question of reasonableness; it was a question of the proper exercise of the trustees&#8217; powers. The principle that the opportunity to a section of the public to benefit had not to be unreasonably restricted by an ability to pay fees, and that people in poverty had not to be excluded, was wrong. It followed that the guidance based on those principles should be corrected (paras 224-236). (2) The court answered the questions referred by the Attorney General (paras 237-258).</p></div></div> </div>

After the plots had been sold off there remained vested in two of the original purchasers, whose successors the plaintiffs were, the roads and a promenade along a sea wall. On the sale of the plots in 1851 the respective purchasers entered into a number of building covenants and these covenants were repeated in a deed of August 19, 1851. The object of the deed was to declare trusts concerning the roads and the promenade for the benefit of the purchasers and to provide (inter alia) for payment of the necessary expenses proportionately by the owners in respect of the upkeep and maintenance of the roads and promenade, and also of the sewers, which had been placed under the road. Cl. 7 of the deed provided: &#8220;That each and every of them the said persons parties to these presents and his respective heirs executors administrators and assigns shall and will from time to time contribute and pay a due and just proportion in respect of the plot or several plots of land in the said plan marked with his name respectively and of the dwelling-house on each such plot erected or to be erected . . .&#8221; in respect of (inter alia) the expenses to be incurred in maintaining and keeping in good repair the roads, sea wall, promenade and sewers. The trustees were empowered to distrain on failure to pay calls. Provision was made for the calling of an annual general meeting of the owners of plots, at which expenses to be incurred in carrying out maintenance and repair work were to be agreed. In 1928, the Lancaster Chancery Court declared that the restrictive covenants did not prevent the owner for the time being of any house erected under the building scheme from dividing it into two or more flats. Pursuant to that declaration the defendants&#8217; house was divided and let to five separate tenants. In 1950 a resolution was passed by a general meeting of plot owners according to which three calls of GBP 3 each were to be made upon the defendants as their plot had been divided into five flats. (The resolution provided that no more than three calls were to be made in respect of any one plot.) The defendants had been willing to pay GBP 3 in respect of the one plot but denied the validity of the resolution purporting to make them liable to pay three calls in respect of one plot.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; (1) although the covenant in respect of which the application to the court had been made was a positive covenant in respect of which the defendants could not have been sued, the defendants could not take the benefits under the deed without subscribing to the obligations thereunder; therefore, they were bound by the deed, if they desired to take its benefits; (2) the provision for distraining on failure to pay the calls was invalid since a right to distrain could only be annexed to a rentcharge, which was not the case here; (3) the whole of this document was concerned with the management of the roads and other amenities for the benefit of the owners of the plots as such and when the document referred to a contributor paying a due and just proportion in respect of a plot or several plots and the dwelling-house thereon, the parties contemplated that there would be an assessment upon each plot; that might be an assessment according to the value of the plot, but it could not really be an assessment in respect of the user to which the plot might be put; accordingly, the resolution was ultra vires and void, for the deed did not empower the meeting of plot owners to exercise their discretion in that way.

In 1935 the owner of the estate sold part of the land to a developer subject to a covenant (the layout stipulation) not to develop the land without prior approval of a layout plan by the estate owner, the covenant being registered as a land charge. The development approved by the owner left a central area undeveloped. That area was bought by the local authority in 1955, planning consent for development was obtained and in 1971 the land was sold to P with the planning consent. Before construction commenced the owner&#8217;s successors in title W reminded P of the covenant stating that any unapproved development would be in breach thereof. After preliminary work started W issued a writ seeking an injunction restraining the development, but P proceeded with the building and sold all the completed houses, remaining owners only of the access road. W did not seek any interlocutory relief. At the trial of W&#8217;s claim for a mandatory injunction against P and the house-owners for demolition of the buildings, held (1) that the covenant was enforceable since it had been entered for the benefit of the covenantee&#8217;s land which was sufficiently defined and was still capable of benefiting the estate; (2) that although P clearly acted in breach of the covenant it would not be just to order demolition of the houses and access road, and damages would be granted in lieu of the mandatory injunctions sought; (3) that the proper measure of damages was a sum which W might reasonably have required in return for relaxing the covenant, being five per cent of P&#8217;s profits, the damages being payable by P and the house-owners in equal proportions.

X Co owned a site containing three parcels of land, the red, the green, and the blue. They obtained planning permission to develop the site, by the erection of a specified number of dwellings. X Co sold the blue land to D Co They imposed a restrictive covenant that D Co should not build more than 300 dwellings on it, so as not to reduce the number of dwellings X Co might build under the planning consent on the retained land. The retained land was described as &#8220;any adjoining or adjacent property&#8221; returned by X Co and included both red and green land. P Co ultimately became owners of both red and green land after various intermediate purchasers. The green land carried an unbroken chain of express assignments of the benefit of the covenant; the red land did not. D Co obtained planning permission to develop the blue land to a higher density than 300 dwellings. P Co sought to restrict them from carrying out the development. The judge held that the green land claimed the benefit of the covenant, but that the red land did not. On appeal by D Co, held, dismissing the appeal, that since the covenant was for the benefit of the retained land and the land was sufficiently described in the conveyance for the purpose of annexation, the covenant related to, or touched and concerned, the land, and the Law of Property Act 1925 s.78(1) annexed the benefit of the covenant to every part of the land. Accordingly, the benefit of the covenant ran with the red land, and P Co were entitled to enforce it as owners both of the green and the red land.

In 1934 one of a number of plots of land was sold to D&#8217;s predecessors in title under a standard form of transfer containing as part of a covenant with the vendor a stipulation against building more than one dwelling-house on the plot.

There was nothing in the first R conveyance that enabled the court to identify what land if any was intended to be benefited by the covenants.

The reference, in Lord Templeman&#8217;s speech in Rhone v Stephens [1994] 2 A.C. 310, to the exercise of those rights being conditional upon the performance of the positive obligation was not limited to cases in which it was expressly so conditional. In substance, the payment of an annual charge for the maintenance of facilities which the covenantors were only entitled to use by virtue of rights granted under the deed was relevant to the continued exercise of those rights even though it was a contribution to the cost of their maintenance: the two were not inconsistent. In some cases, the positive obligation might be completely unrelated to the rights which the owner sought to exercise, Rhone v Stephens , Halsall v Brizell and Thamesmead Town Ltd v Allotey (1998) 30 H.L.R. 1052 applied. W&#8217;s submission about the inability to apportion the maintenance charges was a non-sequitur. In the form A conveyances, the payment was due for the purpose of maintaining the roads, car parks, pleasure grounds and other recreational facilities under Sch.1. In the form B conveyances, it was a payment towards all the matters referred to in cl.4, which included the Sch.1 facilities together with the upkeep of the lawns and the painting of the bungalows. In form B, it did arguably contribute towards the cost of work carried out by the site owner which was not within the rights granted under Sch.1. However, unless the charge could be apportioned, it remained recoverable provided that it also related at least in part to the rights which were included in Sch.1. The successors in title therefore had no answer to the claims unless they could show that the payment covenant had no relation to the Sch.1 rights which they had continued to exercise. Although the continued exercise of those rights was not made expressly conditional upon payment, the payment was intended to ensure that they remained capable of being exercised. The payment, at least in substantial part, was intended to provide a contribution to the cost of maintaining the roads and other facilities over which the owners of the bungalows were granted rights. The cl.4 covenant, by the original site owner, to carry out the repairs was not sufficient to sever any link between the payment covenant and the Sch.1 rights (see paras 27-34 of judgment).</p></div></div> </div>

Accordingly, the current owner of one of the lots was bound by the covenants and could not build further houses on it.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Claim dismissed.<p>(1) For an enforceable scheme to exist, it was necessary for the extent of the estate to be defined at the date of the crystallisation of the scheme. There was no evidence that any plan formed part of the conveyances of the land. However, the 1908 plan had been attached to a contract for a lot sold in that year. That plan identified the lots for sale and also purported to define the boundaries of the estate. It was not speculation to infer that when the first lot was sold in 1906 there was a plan which defined the boundaries of the estate in the same way as the 1908 plan. When the parties&#8217; properties were sold in 1909 and 1910, there would have been a plan attached to the agreement for sale. It might not have been identical to the 1908 plan and the shape of some of the lots might have altered. However, it was near the beginning of the development and the court inferred that it would still have contained the boundaries set out in the 1908 plan. The differences in the 1914 plan in the plots available for sale did not persuade the court that the 1908 plan did not show the estate boundaries (see paras 92-99 of judgment). (2) The estate had many of the classic features of a building scheme. There was a defined estate and it was laid out in lots, albeit the lotting of the eastern part of the estate took place significantly after the initial lotting. Lotting was cogent evidence of an intention that the covenant should be for the common benefit of purchasers. In a case of partial lotting, that inference might not be quite so strong. The covenants attached to each lot were substantially the same and appeared to derive from a standard form of contract. The variations in the covenants were not material. It was also significant that the covenants had been in existence for over 100 years, an association had successfully upheld them, and they were treated as enforceable by purchasers in two cases before the Lands Tribunal. The existence of a power to vary the covenants was equivocal, and was just one matter to be considered in the context of the whole in deciding whether a scheme existed, Wembley Park Estate Co Ltd&#8217;s Transfer, Re [1968] Ch. 491, Whitgift Homes Ltd v Stocks [2001] EWCA Civ 1732, [2001] 48 E.G. 130 (C.S.) and Seymour Road (Southampton) Ltd v Williams [2010] EWHC 111 (Ch), [2010] 2 P. &amp; C.R. DG5 applied. On the balance of probabilities, it was intended that the covenants should be for the common benefit of the purchasers as well as for the vendor, Elliston v Reacher [1908] 2 Ch. 374, Jamaica Mutual Life Assurance Society v Hillsborough [1989] 1 W.L.R. 1101 and Emile Elias &amp; Co Ltd v Pine Groves Ltd [1993] 1 W.L.R. 305 applied.

The agreement, although incapable of being a tenancy by virtue of its uncertain duration, was treated as a tenancy for life at common law and therefore took effect as a 90-year lease determinable either on the tenant&#8217;s death or in accordance with its express termination provisions.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>(1) In the absence of any indication to the contrary, a tenancy granted &#8220;from month to month&#8221; was a monthly tenancy and might be determined by one month&#8217;s notice. However, the precise rights and obligations of the parties depended on the circumstances in which they had been agreed. The circumstances surrounding the agreement were that M was a co-operative housing association and the purpose of entering into an agreement with B had been to provide her with a home. B&#8217;s right of occupation was evidently not intended to be precarious. It was clear for various reasons that the arrangement created by the agreement could only be determinable by M pursuant to cl.6 (see paras 13-22 of judgment). (2) It was a long established principle of law that an agreement for an uncertain term could not be a tenancy, Lace v Chantler [1944] K.B. 368 applied and Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body [1992] 2 A.C. 386 followed. Prudential continued to represent the current state of the law even though aspects of its practical effect were unsatisfactory and without justification. However, the rule had been regarded as fundamental for several centuries and was not to be jettisoned, at least not in the instant case (paras 26-27, 32-37). (3) If the agreement had been entered into before January 1, 1926, when the Act came into force, it would have been treated by the court as being the grant of a tenancy to B for her life subject to her right to determine it under cl.5 and M&#8217;s right to determine it under cl.6, Doe on the demise of Crake v Brown 172 E.R. 992 and Zimbler v Abrahams [1903] 1 K.B. 577 considered (paras 41-44). (4) Under s.149(6) of the Act, the agreement was a tenancy for life at common law and was to be treated as a term of 90 years determinable on B&#8217;s death subject to the express determination provisions in cl.5 and cl.6, Bass Holdings Ltd v Lewis [1986] 2 E.G.L.R. 40 and Skipton Building Society v Clayton (1993) 25 H.L.R. 596 considered (paras 45-53, 82-86). (5) (Obiter) B had established that she had a subsisting tenancy of the premises, but if she had failed to do so, she would still have defeated M&#8217;s claim for possession on the ground that she was entitled to enforce her contractual rights under the agreement. Just because the agreement was incapable of giving rise to a tenancy for some old and technical property law rule did not render it invalid as a matter of contract (paras 59-63). (6) (Per Lord Hope) There were significant differences between the way that English and Scottish law treated occupancy agreements (paras 71-81).</p></div></div> </div>

An employer could grant a licence even where the employee went into occupation before taking up the employment where there was a sufficient nexus between the start of the occupation and the employment. As he had gone into occupation to perform the driving duties expected of him, he was a service licensee and not a tenant ( Street v Mountford [1985] A.C. 809 , AG Securities v Vaughan [1990] 1 A.C. 417 distinguished); (2) the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 s.5(1A) , which requires a valid notice to quit to be served in order to determine the right to occupy a dwelling-house, only applies to a &#8220;periodic licence&#8221;. The licence in this case was not periodic, being granted for the single period of employment, and was terminable on the end of the employment without notice ( Ivory v Palmer [1975] I.C.R. 340 considered).</div></div> </div>

K had occupied residential premises owned by B and originally licensed to a housing trust. Although they had originally been granted licences, they had become tenants of the trust when B had granted the trust a lease of the properties. B had then terminated the lease and sought possession of the properties on the basis that K were trespassers. K had argued that on the termination of the lease they had become tenants of B, and alternatively that Art.8 afforded them a defence to the claim. P were gypsies who had entered onto land owned by L. In response to an application by L for possession of the land they had argued that L was in breach of its statutory obligation to provide gypsy sites, that their circumstances were exceptional and that they were protected by Art.8. The issues were whether (i) K were tenants of B or were trespassers; (ii) the majority decision in Qazi v Harrow LBC [2003] UKHL 43, [2004] 1 A.C. 983 had to be modified to take account of later Strasbourg jurisprudence, particularly the case of Connors v United Kingdom (66746/01) (2005) 40 E.H.R.R. 9; (iii) defendants to possession proceedings brought by public authorities should be permitted in principle to raise an Art.8 defence in those proceedings, rather than being required to raise them by way of judicial review; (iv) the English rules of precedent had to be modified to enable a court to decline to follow a decision by which it would otherwise be bound, if that decision appeared to be inconsistent with a later ruling of the court in Strasbourg.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeals (Lords Bingham, Nicholls and Walker dissenting on the issue of the circumstances in which an Art.8 issue had to be considered), that (1) K were, vis a vis B, trespassers with no right to remain in the properties. Though the lease by B to the trust had meant that there was a relationship of landlord and tenant between the trust and K, K had had no estate in the land and had simply been a licensee when it had granted the original licences. Thus, the tenancies were not derivative estates and any rights enjoyed by K had never been enforceable against B. (2) In so far as the ratio of Qazi was that the enforcement of a right to possession in accordance with the domestic law of property could never be incompatible with Art.8, that had to be modified in the light of Connors , Qazi doubted and Connors applied. (3) It was open to an occupier to raise an Art.8 defence to possession proceedings in the county court rather than by way of judicial review. However, the public authority did not from the outset have to plead and prove that the order sought was justified. Once the court accepted that the property in question was the occupier&#8217;s home for the purposes of Art. 8, it was to proceed on the assumption that the requirements of the domestic law regarding possession struck a fair balance and would provide the justification for interference required by Art.8(2). Further consideration of the interests protected by Art.8 would be unnecessary and there was no requirement that the Art.8 issue had to be considered by the court in every case by taking into account the occupier&#8217;s personal circumstances. Indeed, such a requirement would go further than justified by the Strasbourg jurisprudence. There would, however, be some cases of a special and unusual kind, such as Connors , where the interference with the occupier&#8217;s Art.8 interests would have to be justified by a decision making process that ensured that some special consideration was given to those interests. If there was any defect in the law giving rise to possession then it would have to be amended to provide the necessary safeguards. A defence that did not challenge the law under which the possession order was sought as being incompatible with Art.8, but was based only on the occupier&#8217;s personal circumstances had to be struck out. Where the domestic law provided for personal circumstances to be taken into account, for example where the statutory test was whether it was reasonable to make the order, then there had to be a fair opportunity for the arguments in favour of the occupier to be presented. If, however, the requirements of the law had been established and the right to recover possession was unqualified, the only situations in which it would be open to the court to refrain from making the possession order were if a seriously arguable point was raised that the law was incompatible with Art.8, or if the occupier wished to challenge the public authority&#8217;s decision to seek possession as an improper exercise of its powers on the ground that no reasonable person would consider the decision justifiable. In the former situation the High Court would have to deal with the compatibility issue unless the county court was able to give effect to the law in a way that was compatible, pursuant to s.3 of the 1998 Act. (4) The English courts had to adhere to the English rules of precedent. It was for the national courts to decide in the first instance how the principles expounded in Strasbourg were to be applied, and the ordinary rules of precedent had to apply to those decisions. There had to be a degree of certainty in the interpretation of the law and that was best achieved by adhering to the rules of precedent. If a judge felt that a decision was inconsistent with Strasbourg authority he had to follow the binding precedent but could give leave to appeal as appropriate. (5) (Per Lords Bingham, Nicholls and Walker) In highly exceptional circumstances an occupier might be able to raise a seriously arguable case, on the basis of his personal circumstances, that a possession order would be in breach of Art.8.</div></div> </div>

The landlord (L) granted the tenant (T) a lease of premises in Hong Kong for five years. The lease provided that the expressions `the landlord&#8217; and `the tenant&#8217; should include their assigns. There was payable a security deposit by T returnable at the expiration of the term, if there were no breaches of any of the terms, but otherwise forfeited. T paid the deposit and took the lease. L assigned the reversion to a bank by way of mortgage, but no reference was made to the deposit. L defaulted, and the bank entered into possession. L went into liquidation. T at the end of the term sought the return of the deposit from the bank. The High Court of Hong Kong dismissed the claim, but the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong allowed T&#8217;s appeal, holding that the obligation to return the deposit touched and concerned the land, so that the burden of paying it passed to the bank. The bank&#8217;s appeal to the Judicial Committee was allowed. The obligations to pay and return the deposit were held to be merely personal obligations, between the original parties to the lease, and the right to return was not enforceable against an assignee in the absence of express agreement. Although the deposit was to secure T&#8217;s obligations under the lease including those which touched and concerned the land, the landlord&#8217;s covenant to return the deposit was not itself a covenant dealing with the subject matter of the lease or touching or concerning the land, and did not pass with the reversion.

That conclusion was reinforced by the fact that s.25 was not to be interpreted generously, Avonridge Property Co Ltd v Mashru [2005] UKHL 70, [2005] 1 W.L.R. 3956 followed. If Parliament had intended a tenant&#8217;s guarantor to be able to guarantee obligations of an assignee, it would have been expected to say so explicitly, particularly since guarantors were mentioned expressly in the Act more than once; it had not done so. The circumstances in which a tenant could give a guarantee for an assignee were addressed by s.16 of the Act, but there was no equivalent provision dealing with guarantors; nor did s.16 itself contain any reference to guarantors.

If it were otherwise, a landlord, when granting a tenancy, could require a guarantor of the tenant&#8217;s liabilities, on every assignment of the tenancy, to guarantee the liability of each successive assignee. That would be wholly contrary to the purpose of s.24(2), as it would enable a well-advised landlord to ensure that any guarantor was in precisely the position in which it would have been before the Act came into force. Given the plain purpose of the Act, and the widely expressed terms of s.25(1)(a) and s.25(4), any contractual arrangement contained in the tenancy imposing an obligation, on an existing or prospective guarantor of the tenant&#8217;s liabilities, to guarantee a future assignee&#8217;s liabilities would be void, Avonridge Property Co Ltd v Mashru [2005] UKHL 70, [2005] 1 W.L.R. 3956 followed. That conclusion would also apply to a contractual arrangement contained in a later document, for instance a renewal obligation imposed on a guarantor of an assignee&#8217;s liabilities in an assignment or a licence to assign. When it came to frustrating the effect of s.24(2), cl.3.5(iii) was a fortiori the example of a guarantor of the original tenant entering into a renewal obligation. That was because cl.3.5(iii) was not merely an undertaking by a guarantor of the liability of the original tenant, namely D1, to guarantee the liability of a future assignee, namely D2: it was an undertaking to do so in relation to an assignment which V was entitled to insist on taking place (see paras 21, 23-25 of judgment). (2) The interpretation of s.25(1) apparently given in Good Harvest , that it invalidated any agreement which involved a guarantor of the assignor guaranteeing that assignor&#8217;s assignee, was correct, albeit subject to a very important qualification relating to authorised guarantee agreements under s.16: while the guarantor of an assignor could not normally validly guarantee the liability of the assignee, it could validly do so by being party to an authorised guarantee agreement, Good Harvest applied. Accordingly, the effect of s.24 and s.25 on existing guarantors was that (a) an existing or contracting guarantor of a tenant could not validly be required to commit himself in advance to guarantee the liability of a future assignee; (b) subject to (c) and (d), a guarantor of an assignor could not validly guarantee the liability of the assignor&#8217;s assignee; (c) such a guarantor could validly do so by being party to an authorised guarantee agreement which otherwise complied with s.16; (d) such a guarantor could in any event validly guarantee the liability of an assignee on a further assignment (paras 34, 44, 53). (3) Under cl.3.15(F), V&#8217;s consent was not required to an assignment of the property to another company within the group, provided D3 acted as surety to the assignee. If cl.3.15(F) was a stand-alone provision, then even if the lease was assigned to D2, it could freely be re-assigned straight back to D1, so that any order for specific performance would be pointless. However, the requirements of cl.3.15(F) were cumulative with those in cl.3.15(E), and the commercial context in which the lease was granted eliminated any doubt on that point. Accordingly, cl.3.15(E) could be relied on by V if D2 sought to re-assign the lease back to D1 (paras 62-63, 65, 69).</p></div></div> </div>

Her premise for doing so had been based on a mistaken assumption that once S had parted with the freehold, he could no longer be liable under the covenants in the lease. Under the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, only a tenant escaped liability when he parted with the lease; a landlord did not escape unless and until he applied under s.6 of the Act for release. In the absence of any evidence that S had applied for release after assigning the reversion of the lease, he was the correct defendant to the proceedings. There was no indication that R had been aware of that provision when naming S as the defendant to their proceedings. R&#8217;s success was, therefore, a happy accident for them. S&#8217;s complaint that he should not be liable because R&#8217;s legal team had not operated due diligence when issuing the proceedings was misconceived. There was no duty on a counterpart in litigation to get things right. If they got something wrong, they generally suffered through failing to get the orders they sought. In the instant case, R had taken the right course, albeit by accident. They had secured a judgment, and it had not been appropriate to set it aside, certainly not without taking more formal steps and without giving R an opportunity to consider the proposed decision. Nor had it been appropriate to dismiss the bankruptcy petition. A bankruptcy order would, therefore, be made against S.</p></div></div> </div>

T conducted a retail business on the ground floor of the premises and resided on the first floor. T fell into arrears and L exercised their right of re-entry in relation to the shop premises. T remained resident in the residential premises. L issued a claim for possession on the basis that as a result of their re-entry of the shop premises the lease had been forfeited. L subsequently excluded T from the residential premises and T issued a claim for an injunction that L should be restrained from excluding him from either part of the premises because under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 s.2 the purported forfeiture of the lease was unlawful. The judge found that the demised premises were not let &#8220;as a dwelling&#8221;, that accordingly L were not constrained by s.2 of the 1977 Act, and that therefore the lease had been lawfully forfeited.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal, that (1) the phrase &#8220;let as a dwelling&#8221; in s.2 of the 1977 Act meant &#8220;let wholly or partly as a dwelling&#8221; and so applied to premises that were let for mixed residential and business purposes. When the precursor to s.2 was introduced as the Rent Act 1965 s.31, such was understood to be the established meaning of the phrase, contained, as it had been, in a series of prior enactments and so construed in a series of judgments of the instant court. If that was what the phrase meant in s.31 of the 1965 Act, that was what it must mean in s.2 of the 1977 Act, for the words were identical and lay on the page without any later qualification. The inclusion of a tenancy for mixed purposes in s.8 of the 1977 Act, as in the Housing Act 1996 s.81 and the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 s.167 and s.168, was not idly surplus and its purpose was to exclude such a tenancy from s.3 of the 1977 Act because otherwise the phrase &#8220;let as a dwelling&#8221; would have included such a tenancy in it. It was the clearest window into the meaning of the phrase at least in s.3 and, by reference, in s.2. Wellcome Trust Ltd v Hamad [1998] Q.B. 638 and National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty v Knipe [1998] 1 W.L.R. 230 considered. (2) Reference to T&#8217;s human rights fortified that interpretation of s.2 of the 1977 Act. The cases of Connors v United Kingdom (66746/01) (2005) 40 E.H.R.R. 9 and Kay v Lambeth LBC [2006] UKHL 10, [2006] 2 A.C. 465 assisted performance in the instant case of the obligation under the Human Rights Act 1998 s.3 to strive for compatible interpretation, Connors and Kay applied. From the judgment in Connors the court derived the following: that an interpretation of s.2 of the 1977 Act that prohibited a landlord from exercising otherwise than by proceedings in court an alleged right of re-entry upon premises let for use as a dwelling as well as for business purposes was an interpretation that would be compatible with the tenant&#8217;s rights under the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 Art.8; and by contrast, that the opposite interpretation of it would be incompatible.</div></div> </div>

(1) It was clear from the judgment of Lord Hope in Qazi v Harrow LBC [2003] UKHL 43, [2004] 1 A.C. 983 at para.74 that the rule in Monk , which meant that an order for possession was inevitable, was not a violation of art.8, particularly in the light of the Commission&#8217;s response in Ure v United Kingdom (Admissibility) (28027/95) . In the binding decisions of Qazi , Kay , and Doherty all the arguments were predicated on the indefeasible right to possession arising from service of a notice to quit, and it had been accepted that the provision for notices to quit in common law was consistent with Article 8. McCann was only of persuasive authority and was distinguishable because in that case the local authority had chosen to bypass the statutory scheme by requesting Mrs McCann to sign a notice to quit and had given no consideration to the applicant&#8217;s right to respect to his home, whereas in the instant case W had not persuaded D&#8217;s sister to serve her notice to quit. Furthermore D had no right to remain in the property, not only because of the common law rule, but also because Parliament had deliberately chosen not to bring a case such as his within the statutory scheme of protection; (2) Whereas Doherty was an exceptional case because of the discriminatory effect of the statutory scheme, D&#8217;s case was not in any way exceptional as required by Kay , but rather D&#8217;s challenge to the possession order was based only on his personal circumstances. Kay was binding authority that the decision made by W to seek summary possession in reliance on its right to possession under domestic law could only be challenged if its decision was one that no reasonable person could consider justifiable, i.e. the test enunciated in Wandsworth LBC v Winder (No.1) [1985] A.C. 461. There was a distinction between W having to take into account D&#8217;s art.8 rights and to consider proportionality, and the court substituting its own view of proportionality for W&#8217;s. Although W had not specifically referred to the balancing exercise set out in art.8(2), its careful decision making process accorded with art.8 and the decision was one to which it could reasonably come.</p></div></div> </div>

When W left the flat, she gave NHT notice to quit the premises expiring on December 4, 1995, the notice being effective to terminate the tenancy on that date. H successfully appealed ((1997) 29 H.L.R. 767, [1997] C.L.Y. 2490) against a decision (i) refusing his application for an adjournment of possession proceedings brought by NHT on the ground that he intended to apply for a property adjustment order under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 s.24 , and (ii) making a possession order in NHT&#8217;s favour. The Court of Appeal held that the merits of H&#8217;s claim should have been considered, the termination of the tenancy by the expiry of the notice to quit being a reviewable disposition which, under s.37(2)(b) of the Act, the court had power to set aside if satisfied that it was made with a view to defeating H&#8217;s claim for financial relief.

In 1955 the plaintiff council acquired a plot of land near some houses needed to carry out a planned road diversion. The land was left vacant for many years. The roadside of the plot was fenced but there was no fence between the garden of a house owned by the defendant&#8217;s predecessor in title and the plot: the predecessor in title treated it as part of his garden. The defendant carried on this practice after he bought the house in 1971, although he was aware who owned it. In January 1976 the defendant replied to an enquiry of the council in a letter marked &#8220;Without prejudice&#8221; that he understood that he was entitled to use the land until the road was built. The council replied refuting his right to use the land but did not assert actual possession until a writ was issued in October 1985, claiming possession. The defendant claimed adverse possession for more than 12 years, and that the council&#8217;s claim was barred by the Limitation Act 1980 s.15 . The judge held that the defendant&#8217;s letter of January 1976 was inadmissible since it was marked &#8220;Without prejudice&#8221; and was privileged. The council&#8217;s claim was dismissed and they appealed.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; dismissing the appeal, that the defendant&#8217;s letter was not an offer to negotiate but an assertion of the defendant&#8217;s right and so could not fairly be read as the opening of negotiations. Therefore it was not privileged and was admissible in evidence South Shropshire DC v Amos [1986] 1 W.L.R. 1271 distinguished. There was no special rule of law that an owner of land who intended to use it for a particular purpose at some future date could not lose title to it to a squatter whose acts did not substantially interfere with the owner&#8217;s plans for future use. Where the squatter could show factual possession and an intention to create adverse possession to exclude the world at large, including the true owner, he could establish adverse possession if there was very clear evidence in a case that he was aware of the owner&#8217;s plans for the future of the land. Since the defendant had established adverse possession by October 28, 1973 i.e. 12 years before the writ was issued by acquiring complete and exclusive physical control and had an intention for the time being to possess to the exclusion of all others including the true owner, he had defeated the council&#8217;s claim Powell v McFarlane (1979) 38 P. &amp; C.R. 452 applied; Leigh v Jack (1879) 5 Ex.

For over 12 years prior to November 1983, T occupied certain land adversely to the freehold owner, the council. In correspondence starting in November 1982, the council sought to regularise T&#8217;s occupation by granting him a licence for a fee, but T&#8217;s solicitors initially maintained that he had acquired the freehold title by adverse possession. After threats by the council to institute proceedings for possession, an agreement dated November 3, 1983, was concluded for a lease of the land by the council to T, in which T acknowledged the council&#8217;s title to the land and stated that he had not gained any right, title or interest to or in it by adverse possession. In subsequent proceedings, the council sought declarations that it was the freehold owner to the land and that T had no estate or interest except as a tenant under the November 1983 agreement. The judge held that T was estopped from asserting any other title.

Evidence in support of the claim of adverse possession was given by D, the son in law of R, the previous owner of the property, to the effect that they had always treated the disputed strip of land as part of the garden and assumed that the chestnut paling fence, originally erected by H&#8217;s predecessor, formed the rear boundary.

J had permitted G to occupy the land for grazing purposes by means of a written agreement in 1983. The agreement expired in December 1983. J declined to renew it and requested that G vacate the land. Although permitted to take a cut of hay in 1984, G&#8217;s continued occupation and use of the land thereafter lacked permission.

In order to be in possession of land the squatter had to exercise the necessary degree of physical custody and control and to show an intention to possess the land. The squatter had to intend to exclude the world at large, including the paper title owner so far as was reasonably practicable. The requisite degree of physical control was dependent, inter alia, on the nature of the land and the manner of its usage. It was also necessary to demonstrate that the squatter had been treating the land in the manner of an occupying owner and that no other individual had done so. It was immaterial that the squatter would have been willing to pay to occupy the land if requested to do so. Furthermore, it was not necessary to demonstrate an intention to own or acquire ownership of the land. In the instant case, the judge had been correct to conclude that G had established possessory title to the land, Powell v McFarlane (1979) 38 P. &amp; C.R. 452 and Buckinghamshire CC v Moran [1990] Ch. 623 applied and Leigh v Jack (1879) 5 Ex.

In each case it was necessary to examine the determination, in order to see whether it lay within the scope of the expert&#8217;s authority. If it did not, then it had no effect as between the parties. If it did, then the contract also governed the question whether the determination was binding or whether, and if so to what extent or on what grounds, the determination could be questioned, Jones v Sherwood Computer Services Plc [1992] 1 W.L.R. 277 and Mercury Communications Ltd v Director General of Telecommunications [1996] 1 W.L.R. 48 applied. (2) Despite the absence of any words such as &#8220;final and binding&#8221;, the surveyor was given exclusive power under the lease to determine the questions to which his certificate was directed. J need not have responded to the requests for clarification of his certificate and his report. If he had not done so, he could not have been compelled to explain himself. However, since he did so, and thereby made clear the basis on which he had proceeded, the court had to look at his explanations when considering whether the certificate was prepared on the correct basis. (3) The definition of the reserved minerals was puzzling, but the implications of the rival interpretations were such that H&#8217;s reading was clearly to be preferred. H was only able to take for itself 12,000 tonnes of building stone in any year, and S would be entitled to sell as building stone any stone suitable for that purpose which it in fact extracted. (4) J accordingly erred by proceeding on the basis that S was not entitled to remove from the land any limestone which was suitable for use as building stone. On the correct construction of the lease J should not have left the reserved minerals out of account, or at most he should have disregarded 12,000 tonnes as one year&#8217;s entitlement on the part of H. (5) It was for J to come to his own view as to whether the minerals were no longer economically recoverable but his certificate was only effective under the lease if it considered the question of economic recoverability by reference to the correct definition of the minerals, National Grid Co Plc v M25 Group Ltd (No.1) [1999] 1 E.G.L.R. 65 applied; Norwich Union Life Insurance Society v P&amp;O Property Holdings Ltd [1993] 1 E.G.L.R. 164 distinguished.

The burden had been on him to establish both matters and, if he was to discharge that burden, his evidence had to be unequivocal. Crucially, he had done nothing until 1995 to exclude X from enjoying the same free access to the land through a garden gate as it had had since it acquired the land in 1990. His omission to bar such access by October 13, 1991 made hopeless his claim that he had by then assumed exclusive possession, or, perhaps more obviously, his claim that he had by then manifested an intention to exclude the world at large and X in particular, JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham [2002] UKHL 30, [2003] 1 A.C. 419 applied. (2) S&#8217;s second submission was in effect an artificial attempt to shift to X the burden of disproving a case that he had not managed to establish. There was no principle of law to the effect that, in a case such as this, it would only be acts of possession by the paper owner carried out during a limited period after the claimed ouster that would or might serve to defeat the claim that there had been such an ouster. Such a proposition was contrary to principle. The evidence showed that X had continued to enjoy possession of the land and demonstrated the frailty of S&#8217;s claim that he had both excluded X and intended to exclude it from such possession.</p></div></div> </div>

The local authority appealed against a decision ([2001] EWCA Civ 1834; [2002] U.K.H.R.R. 316) that its pursuit of possession proceedings against Q constituted an interference with his right to respect for his home under the Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8 and that the question of justification under Art.8(2) should be remitted to the county court. Q and his wife had been joint tenants of local authority housing under a secure tenancy when his wife left, giving notice to terminate the tenancy. On termination, Q had no right to remain in the property and no defence under ordinary law to possession proceedings, although he had been living in the premises continuously for eight years when the proceedings were brought. The issues were whether the Court of Appeal had erred in concluding that (1) the premises constituted Q&#8217;s &#8220;home&#8221; at the time the possession proceedings were served for the purposes of Art.8, and (2) the making of a possession order would constitute an interference with Q&#8217;s right to respect for his home under Art.8(1), requiring determination of whether the interference was justified under Art.8(2).</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; allowing the appeal (Lords Bingham and Steyn dissenting), that (1) the fact that Q&#8217;s tenancy had expired when the possession proceedings were served was irrelevant to the factual question of whether the premises were his home within the meaning of Art.8.

Consequently, there was no question to be considered by the county court. Per Lords Bingham and Steyn, any action by a public authority seeking possession of residential property occupied by a defendant as his home would ordinarily engage Art.8. The reasoning of the Court of Appeal reflected the tenor of Strasbourg jurisprudence and gave effect to the purpose of the Convention, Wood v United Kingdom (32540/96) (1997) 24 E.H.R.R.

The instant case was remitted to the trial judge for him to determine whether the decision to terminate the appellant traveller&#8217;s licence on the grounds stated in the particulars of claim, and having regard to the length of time he and his family had lived on the site, was reasonable.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal allowed.<p>(1) At common law a landlord was entitled to possession of premises if the tenant&#8217;s lease, or tenancy, or licence had expired or had been validly terminated. The local authority&#8217;s common law right was surrounded by statutory infrastructure, and the Caravan Sites Act 1968 and the Mobile Homes Act 1983 conferred some protection on those who made their homes in caravans. However, the words of s.5(1) of the 1983 Act were a clear indication that Parliament intended that the law should be different in respect to gypsy caravan sites provided by local authorities. In the instant case the composite legal scheme clearly reflected the intention of Parliament and s.6(2) did apply. (2) The basic rule remained as laid down by the majority in Qazi v Harrow LBC [2003] UKHL 43, [2004] 1 A.C. 983 and reaffirmed by the majority in Kay , and county court judges should continue to follow the guidance given in Kay , Quazi and Kay applied. Although in McCann v United Kingdom (19009/04) [2008] 2 F.L.R. 899 the European Court of Human Rights endorsed the reasoning of the minority in Kay and practical recognition had to be given to the principles laid down in judgments from the European Court of Human Rights, that could be done in the instant case by applying and developing the reasoning of the majority, McCann considered. Until the European Court of Human Rights had developed principles on which the English courts could rely for general application, the only safe course was to take the decision in each case as it arose. The point of automatic possession proceedings was generally to provide a quick and reliable way for a public authority to evict tenants whose lease had been terminated by the operation of law. A procedure which gave a discretion to the court by requiring it to consider whether, having regard to art.8, the making of the order would be proportionate would be inimical for that purpose. (3) The modification that was made to Qazi to accommodate the decision in Connors applied to the instant case. Special considerations for the needs of gypsies and their different lifestyles required that D had to be able to insist that it be shown that there was a proper justification for the decision to seek a possession order. If it could not be shown that the local authority&#8217;s decision to evict him was justified by a pressing social need and was proportionate, there was a risk that D&#8217;s rights under art.8 would have been violated, Connors applied. (4) The Court of Appeal was correct to hold that there was no arguable basis for asserting that the incompatibility of the local authority&#8217;s decision could be dealt with under gateway (a). It was not possible for a solution to the instant case to be found in part (i) of gateway (a) by making use of the interpretative obligation in s.3(1) of the 1998 Act. The need to make a declaration of incompatibility in relation to s.5(1) was removed by the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. (5) The case should be remitted to the judge so that he could examine D&#8217;s defence under gateway (b). An examination of whether the local authority&#8217;s decision was reasonable, having regard to the aim it was pursuing and to the length of time D and his family had lived on the site was appropriate. The test of reasonableness should be whether the decision to recover possession was one that no reasonable person would consider justifiable, Kay applied.</p></div></div> </div>

Under the Housing Act 1996 s.143D(3) that meant that P&#8217;s demoted tenancy came to an end on that date and he became a tolerated trespasser. However, s.299 of the 2008 Act abolished the concept of tolerated trespass in relation to various types of tenancy, including demoted tenancies, by providing that where an order for possession was made, the tenancy ended on the date that the order was executed rather than the date on which the tenant was to give up possession pursuant to the order. Therefore, if the original possession order was confirmed a new demoted tenancy would be created in P&#8217;s favour due to the effect of Sch.11 para.16, 19 and 26 of the 2008 Act (see paras 6-8 of judgment). (2) There might be force in the technical point made by P, but there was no need to consider it as the wide terms of the Supreme Court Rules 2009 r.29(1) allowed the Supreme Court to adopt an alternative way of giving effect to the local authority&#8217;s justified concerns. The original order for possession would be set aside and a fresh order for possession substituted to take effect on March 10, 2011. The effect of that would be to preserve P&#8217;s original demoted tenancy which had continued pending the resolution of the instant proceedings. It would come to an end when possession was obtained against him pursuant to the new order for possession. That was consistent with the Supreme Court&#8217;s earlier reasoning in which it had decided that the judge and the Court of Appeal had reached their conclusions on an erroneous basis. Thus the order for possession made below was effectively overruled and the Supreme Court had concluded that it should make its own order for possession. If the case had been remitted to the county court, the original order would have been set aside and the county court would in due course have made a fresh order for possession. It would be anomalous if a different result was obtained because the Supreme Court decided to make the order for possession without remitting it (paras 12-14).</p></div></div> </div>

In the ordinary case, the relevant facts would be encapsulated entirely in the two legitimate aims that were identified in Pinnock , namely vindicating the local authority&#8217;s ownership rights and enabling it to comply with its public duties in relation to the allocation and management of its housing stock. It was against those aims, which should always be taken for granted, that the court had to weigh up any factual objections that might be raised by the defendant and what he had to say about his personal circumstances. Only if a defence was put forward that was seriously arguable would it be necessary to adjourn the case for further consideration of the issues of lawfulness or proportionality. If that test was not met, the order for possession should be granted. The threshold for raising an arguable case on proportionality was a high one which would be reached in only a small proportion of cases (see paras 34-45 of judgment). (Per Lord Phillips) In homelessness cases, while there was no burden on a local authority, in the first instance, to justify to the court its application for a possession order or to plead the reason for seeking such an order, the tenant had to be informed of the reason for the authority&#8217;s action so that he could, if so minded, attempt to raise a proportionality challenge (para.116). (2) (Per Lord Hope) On the face of it, the court had no discretion under s.127(2) as to whether or not it should make an order for possession against an introductory tenant. However, in Pinnock , which involved a demoted tenant, the court held that, as lawfulness had to be an inherent requirement of the procedure for seeking a possession order, it had equally to be open to the court to consider whether that procedure had been lawfully followed having regard to the defendant&#8217;s art.8 rights. It was by that route, and by the application of the Human Rights Act 1998 s.3(1) and s.7(1)(b), that the court held that s.143D(2) of the 1996 Act could be read and given effect to enable the judge to deal with a defence that relied on an alleged breach of the defendant&#8217;s rights under art.8. There was a sufficient similarity between s.127(2) and s.143D(2) to apply the reasoning in Pinnock to introductory tenancies also, Pinnock applied (paras 51, 56). (3) (Per Lord Hope) The effect of s.89(1) of the 1980 Act was to remove from the court the discretion which it had at common law to select whatever length of postponement it thought fit. However, s.89 did not take away from the court its ordinary powers of case management. It would be perfectly proper for it, for example, to defer making the order for possession pending an appeal or to enable proceedings to be brought in the Administrative Court. An adjournment would also be a permissible exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion (paras 58, 63).</p></div></div> </div>

Whilst the majority of the Court of Appeal declined to comment on the issue, the minority suggested obiter that the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 art.8 was capable of application where squatters had trespassed onto a private landowner&#8217;s land and established a home there, though it would only be in exceptional circumstances that the squatters&#8217; eviction would constitute a disproportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim of enforcing the landowner&#8217;s property rights.</p></div><div class='details details-held'><b>Held</b>&mdash; Appeal dismissed.<p>(1) (Per Sir Alan Ward) Having considered all of the relevant authorities, McPhail could no longer be regarded as good law, McPhail not followed. It was rightly common ground that X had established a home on the land because of a &#8220;sufficient and continuous link with a specific place&#8221;, and were therefore entitled to protection under art.8(1). Even if art.8 had no direct application between a private landowner and the trespassers on his land, the court as a public authority was obliged by the Human Rights Act 1998 s.6 to act compatibly with that right. It had to consider whether the making of a possession order was proportionate, and whether the occupiers&#8217; eviction was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, Powell and Pinnock followed. The rule in McPhail that the court had no jurisdiction to extend time to a trespasser could no longer stand against a requirement that proportionality might demand that a trespasser be given some time before being required to vacate. Another crucial factor distinguishing the current position from McPhail was the fact that in McPhail there was no defence to the claim of possession, whereas if art.8 was engaged, there was at least a potential defence. If proportionality conferred upon the court a discretion to consider giving time to the trespasser, then the Housing Act 1980 s.89 had to apply. However, s.89 did not prevent the making of a possession order forthwith: it merely placed a limit on possession being delayed beyond 14 days after the making of the order, save in cases of exceptional hardship. Accordingly, the test was whether eviction was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. The fact that the landowner had a legal right to possession was a very strong factor in support of proportionality: it spoke for itself and needed no further explanation or justification. Thus, even if squatters had established a home on land where they otherwise had no legal right to remain, it was difficult to imagine exceptional circumstances which would give them an unlimited and unconditional right to remain (see paras 26-28 of judgment). (2) There was no error in the judge&#8217;s approach. Having found that art.8 was engaged, she correctly identified the issue as whether art.8 afforded &#8220;any additional protection to the defendants&#8221;, namely whether eviction was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. It was beyond question that she was considering whether to extend the time at which possession was to be given. She started with the difficulty of envisaging circumstances where eviction would not be found to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. There was nothing wrong with that approach. An owner was entitled to the return of his property unless some exceptional circumstances militated against it. The judge was fully alive to the fact that X were &#8220;good&#8221; squatters, and was obviously impressed by them and to that extent sympathetic. It was impossible to find that she was not entitled to conclude that the benefits to the local community arising from X&#8217;s occupation were not enough to preclude M seeking to vindicate his ownership rights to the immediate return of his property. If and in so far as she was relying on McPhail for the assertion that the court had no jurisdiction to extend time for possession, she was wrong, but that error had no material effect upon her judgment (paras 38-39). (3) (Per Toulson, LJ and Lloyd, LJ) Whilst agreeing that the judge was right on the availability of art.8 as a defence to the claim, and that her carefully reasoned decision to order immediate possession of the land could not be faulted and the appeal had to be dismissed, opinion was reserved on whether McPhail had ceased to represent the law in cases of trespass to privately owned land, McPhail considered (paras 42, 47-48, 51-52).</p></div></div> </div>

There was a small group of cases where the ECtHR had applied the proportionality test to a possession claim by a private landlord, but in no case had the landlord had an unconditional right under the tenancy agreement to return of the property on a date which had passed. Further, the cases had proceeded on the assumed basis that the proportionality test applied when art.8 was engaged in a dispute between a tenant and a private landlord, Brezec v Croatia (7177/10) [2014] H.L.R. 3, Zrilic v Croatia (46726/11) , Buckland v United Kingdom (40060/08) (2013) 56 E.H.R.R. 16, Zehentner v Austria (20082/02) (2011) 52 E.H.R.R. 22 and Belchikova v Russia (2408/06) considered. There was other authority to the effect that the proportionality test did not apply in the instant situation as it would interfere with the operation of arrangements agreed between private parties, Buckland considered. None of the cases was a Grand Chamber decision. If there was a serious point or one requiring an extension of the case law, the case could be referred to the Grand Chamber. To apply the proportionality test when a tenant relied on art.8 in the context of a private dispute would raise substantial issues; the absence of a Grand Chamber decision requiring art.8(2) to be applied in those circumstances confirmed the instant court&#8217;s conclusion (see paras 24-25, 33, 38-42 of judgment). Even had the proportionality test applied, the court would still have made a possession order. The judge had stated that had the test applied, he would have found making an order disproportionate. In doing so, he had taken irrelevant factors into account, such as the lack of dishonesty on L&#8217;s part in their mortgage application, and had left out of account relevant matters such as the lender&#8217;s entitlement to recover its capital. Further, there was no indication that the judge had directed himself that very few cases met the high standard required for interference with the landlord&#8217;s rights in public sector cases; the position could not be different in a private landlord case. Matters to be taken into account in T&#8217;s favour were that she would suffer distress on having to move, but those who treated and cared for her would be able to help her through the immediate distress and take precautions to prevent her from causing herself serious harm. On the other side there was some £200,000 owing to the lender, which would be unable to recoup that money unless a possession order was made (paras 47-53). In any event, the instant court was bound by Poplar Housing &amp; Regeneration Community Association Ltd v Donoghue [2001] EWCA Civ 595, [2002] Q.B. 48 to hold that s.21 was compatible with the Convention, precluding it from holding that the proportionality test applied, Poplar followed (para.55). (2) The mortgage conditions had to be interpreted purposively. Their purpose was to enable the receivers to realise the charged property in an orderly and efficient way. The powers conferred on them therefore had to include power to do anything necessarily incidental to the exercise of the specified powers, including the power to take possession of the property and sell it, M Wheeler &amp; Co Ltd v Warren [1928] Ch. 840 applied. The receivers had had to serve the s.21 notice to get vacant possession and thereby sell the property at the best price. The fact that the mortgage conditions could have been drafted to confer an express power on the mortgagee to give a s.21 notice, or that the mortgagee might have been able to serve the notice by virtue of being within the definition of &#8220;landlord&#8221; did not mean that the receivers could not do so where they had that power under the mortgage conditions (para.65).</p></div></div> </div>
