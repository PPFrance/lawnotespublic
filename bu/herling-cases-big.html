He had seen a sample of the oats. In fact they were new, not old. For that reason he refused to pay for them, and was sued by the plaintiff. At trial, the judge directed the jury to give a verdict in the defendant&#8217;s favour if they found that the oats had been described as “old”, or alternatively if they found if the plaintiff seller had been aware that the defendant believed he was contracting to buy old oats. They found for the defendant, but were not asked to state on which basis. The Court of Appeal ordered a re-trial on the ground that the trial judge&#8217;s direction had been unclear.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The value of the case lies in the judges&#8217; discussion of the direction given to the jury at trial, and the fine distinction that in their view it failed to convey.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The first part of the direction to the jury was unexceptionable. If, as the defendant contended, the plaintiff seller had referred to the oats as “old”, then that would have been materially misleading. The second part of the direction had been unclear (although technically acceptable) because it failed to make an adequate distinction between two possible situations. If the plaintiff had merely been aware that the defendant was buying the oats believing them to be old, and had taken no steps to disabuse him of that belief, then the contract was valid. However, if the plaintiff had known that the defendant thought he had the benefit of a contractual promise that the oats were old, then there would have been no true agreement between the parties, and therefore no contract. The jury could not reliably be assumed to have grasped that fine distinction.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The decision in <i>Smith v Hughes</i> turns upon quite a narrow point of construction, but the judgments lay down broad propositions about the way in which contracting parties&#8217; states of mind impact upon the validity of their dealings. One party may be mistaken about the subject matter of the contract, even to the extent that he would not have entered into the contract had he known the truth, but the contract remains valid. The principle is stated by Blackburn J to be this: “If, whatever a man&#8217;s real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party&#8217;s terms”. Furthermore, the one party may be aware that the other is making a mistake, but be under no obligation to correct him; still the contract is valid.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is quite different if one has taken active steps to promote or sustain the mistaken belief; the objective appearance of agreement yields to the subjective knowledge of the true state of affairs. The reason is that deception is now present; naturally no court will collude with it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It seems that the same result follows where the mistake relates to the terms of the contract and the other knows of the mistake, <i>even though he has done nothing to induce it.</i> Cases of this sort, all involving mistakes as to price, are given below. First, though, be aware of another case in which the doctrine of <i>Smith v Hughes</i> cuts through the confusion.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-5'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Offers - Objective view of Intention and Agreement</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This is another case in which objective appearance prevailed over a subjective concern. The plaintiffs were asked by their Egyptian house to acquire “Moroccan horsebeans described here as feveroles”. They asked the defendants&#8217; representative what “feveroles” were, and were told that they were simply horsebeans. A chain of related supply contracts was then agreed in which the commodity to be supplied was described as “horsebeans”. The eventual buyer found that they were not “feveroles”, and sought damages. The plaintiffs in the present action were applying for rectification of their contract with the defendants on the basis that it mistakenly referred to “horsebeans” and should have specified “feveroles”. They failed. The agreement was simply one for the supply of horsebeans.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The judgment of <span class="bd">Denning LJ</span> includes emphatic support for the objective approach to the construction of contracts: “The parties no doubt intended that the goods should satisfy the inquiry of the Egyptian buyers, namely, “horsebeans described in Egypt as feveroles”. They assumed that they would do so, but they made no contract to that effect. Their agreement, as outwardly expressed, both orally and in writing, was for “horsebeans”. That is all the defendants ever committed themselves to supply; and all that they should be bound to”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-6'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Offers - Objective view of Intention and Agreement</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The sellers offered Argentine hare skins at a given price per pound. This was a mistake; they had in mind the price per piece, and had therefore quoted at roughly one third of the going rate. The buyer ordered 30,000 hare skins, and sued the sellers when they refused to deliver. The court held that the buyer must have been aware of the sellers&#8217; mistake, and therefore must have been aware that the sellers&#8217; offer did not represent their true intention. Thus there was no agreement between the parties upon which an action could be maintained.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The case is significant because it seems to propose that the subjective knowledge of an error defeats the objective appearance of agreement.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;There was strong evidence in this case that the price of Argentine hare skins was normally quoted per piece, so the court had no difficulty concluding that the buyer must have been aware of the mistake.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Behaviour like that of the buyer here is often described as the “snapping up” of an offer. It occurs where one party purports to accept an offer which he knows it was not the other&#8217;s true intention to make. Here, it seems to work to say that the parties were not “ad idem”. However some care is needed in order to reconcile this principle with some of what was said in <i>Smith v Hughes</i>. There, it would have been acceptable for the seller of new oats to enforce a bargain with a buyer who obviously thought the oats were old. Is that known mistake really different from the known mistake in <i>Hartog</i>? It seems that it is. The allowable mistake in <i>Smith v Hughes</i> can be regarded as one of mere motive; the buyer is making a wrong, unintended, unwise deal, maybe even to the certain knowledge of the seller, but he is under no mistake as to the terms of the deal itself. The invalidating mistake in <i>Hartog</i> concerns one of the most fundamental terms of the deal – the price.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Nevertheless, it is easy to lose sight of this distinction. The reason is that the court&#8217;s express analysis in Hartog focuses quite strongly on the state of mind of the would-be buyer of hare skins; he must have known that the other was making a mistake. It is tempting to conclude that it is the presence of this knowledge (with its connotations of impropriety) that drives the decision. In a more recent case, Chwee Kin Kong v Digilandmall.com Pte [2004] SGHC 71, there is express emphasis on the state of mind of the would-be snappers up. When a price for laser printers was mistakenly given as 66 rather than 3,854 Singaporean dollars, buyers were said to have moved “at the dead of night” and with “indecent haste” to place huge orders before the mistake could be corrected. Unsurprisingly, they were not successful in their attempt to sue for loss of profits when the printers were not delivered. But on a proper analysis, the reason they fail is <b>not</b> that they attempt to take unconscionable advantage of the mistaken seller. Nor is it that the seller&#8217;s mistake is clear. They fail because the mistake relates to a term of the contract so that the parties are never in agreement. If the mistake had been equally serious and equally obvious, but related only to something beyond the terms of the contract, the result ought in theory to be different.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Why does this distinction seem to get overlooked? The answer is that it is always going to be easier to talk about one party&#8217;s bad behaviour than about the fine and abstract difference between two types of mistake. This is often so in law; the surface discourse may not wholly connect with the real principles in play.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Further permutations of mistake affecting the formation of the contract will be examined later (during term 2) when the various types of contractual mistake are in issue. The cases on “mutual mistake”, where the parties are at cross-purposes, and “common mistake”, where they share a single delusion, take the discussion forward. However, you may already be wondering why so much should seem to turn on the distinction between a mistake about the content of a contract, and a mistake about its context. <span class="bd">Treitel</span> comments that “this distinction seems to be generally accepted, but the reason for it is not easy to see” (para 8-044).</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">There is another well-known case on the attempted snapping-up of an offer – <i>Centrovincial Estates plc v Merchant Investors Assurance Company Ltd. </i> A lot of prominence is given to it by <span class="bd">McKendrick</span>, even though it does not go far beyond the two cases set out above. However, a procedural aspect of the case makes it rather hard to understand. For some help with the difficulty, read on.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

After the lessees had agreed, the landlords stated that they had made a mistake, and had meant to propose the sum of £126,000. The lessees objected that £65,000 was the contractually agreed figure. The landlords brought an action against them, seeking a declaration that there was no agreement. As part of this action, they sought summary judgment. The Court of Appeal held that summary judgment could not be obtained on these facts. Therefore, at this interlocutory stage, the lessees won.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Explanation</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Since the first figure proposed by the landlords was so much lower than the figure they had meant to propose, this looks like a typical snapping-up case. It is therefore difficult at first glance to understand why it goes against the landlords. The key to it is this. An application for summary judgment (ie. a quick victory) can be made where it is possible to show at a preliminary hearing that the other side can have no arguable defence to one&#8217;s claim, and therefore should not be allowed to proceed to a full trial. Here, the landlords conceded that the case would need to proceed to full trial for it to be established on the evidence whether the lessees did or did not know that a mistake was being made. That concession was fatal to their application for summary judgment. Therefore the lessees successfully defended this claim even though it may have been likely that they would lose when the matter was more closely investigated at trial.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Is there in fact any difference between the perspectives of Smith v Hughes and Rose v Pim on the one hand, and Hartog v Colin &amp; Shields and Centrovincial Estates plc v Merchant Investors on the other? At a first glance, one would think so. The first two cases seem to support an objective analysis, to which appearance rather than subjective intention matters. The second two cases seem to establish a limit to that perspective; there can be no reliance on objective appearance when it is subjectively known to be false.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">On closer consideration, however, the two perspectives can be shown to be one and the same. It is the second – the subjective long-stop – which needs to be examined more closely. Technically, the factor which disentitles the would-be buyers in Hartog and Digilandmall from accepting what they are mistakenly offered may not be their realisation of the mistake. Instead it may be that a reasonable person in their position would realise that a mistake had been made. The long-stop is not subjective; it is actually an extension of the basic rule itself. The status of the parties&#8217; communications is determined objectively, and that perspective may reveal an offer in law even though there was no subjective intention to make one, or negate the existence of an offer which was subjectively but mistakenly intended. Appearance governs.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He was prosecuted by the RSPCA under the Protection of Birds Act 1954 which made it an offence unlawfully to offer for sale a wild live bird. The magistrates convicted him of the offence.

To this, one might object that Parliament&#8217;s intention in passing the relevant section of the Act was almost certainly to punish people who tried to sell wild birds. The defendant in this case was just such a person, but because in the eye of contract law it is the would-be purchaser here who makes an offer to buy, the seller goes unpunished.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

A shopkeeper displayed a flick knife in the window of his shop with a ticket behind it which read “Ejector knife- 4s”. He was charged under section 1 (1) of the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959, which made it an offence to offer such a knife for sale. It was held that he had not offered the knife for sale. The knife and the label merely constituted an invitation to treat.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;If <i>Partridge v Crittenden</i> was a difficult case to swallow, <i>Fisher v Bell</i> beggars belief. What was section 1 (1) of the Act passed by Parliament for, if not to suppress the selling of offensive weapons? By whatever reasoning could judges so thoroughly stultify its intention?<br>&emsp;&emsp;An explanation is given in the judgment of Lord Parker CJ: “…any statute must of course be looked at in the light of the general law of the country. Parliament in its wisdom in passing an Act must be taken to know the general law. It is perfectly clear that according to the ordinary law of contract the display of an article with a price on it in a shop window is merely an invitation to treat. It is in no sense an offer for sale the acceptance of which concludes a contract….<br>&emsp;&emsp;In those circumstances I am driven to the conclusion, though I confess reluctantly, that no offence was here committed. At first sight it sounds absurd that knives of this sort cannot be manufactured, sold, hired, lent or given, but apparently they can be displayed in shop windows; but even if this – and I am by no means saying it is – is a casus omissus, it is not for this court to supply the omission. I am mindful of the strong words of Lord Simonds in <i>Magor and St Mellons Rural District Council v Newport Corporation</i>…. In that case one of the Lords Justices in the Court of Appeal…had, in effect, said that the court having discovered the supposed intention of Parliament must proceed to fill in the gaps – what the Legislature has not written the court must write – and in answer to that contention Lord Simonds in his speech [in the House of Lords] said… “It appears to me to be a naked usurpation of the legislative function under the thin guise of interpretation”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The need to preserve certainty in the law of contract goes some way to explaining these surprising decisions, but why did the law tend to regard advertisements as mere invitations to treat rather than offers in the first place?</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

This required the House of Lords to decide whether an offer was made when a price list of wines was sent out by a wine merchant. It was held that the list was merely an invitation to treat, not an offer.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Herschell: “The transmission of such a price-list does not amount to an offer to supply an unlimited quantity of the wine described at the price named, so that as soon as an order is given there is a binding contract to supply that quantity. If it were so, the merchant might find himself involved in any number of contractual obligations to supply wine of a particular description which he could be quite unable to carry out, his stock of wine of that description being necessarily limited.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The value which is being upheld here is business sense, or commercial convenience. Merchants must be able to alert prospective purchasers to their presence in the market without the risk of ending up bound to perform an impossible multiplicity of contracts from a limited stock. However, convincing though that reasoning may be, does it flout any other interest? Surely that of a prospective purchaser, who receives what is effectively an inducement to buy, duly places an order, and finds himself without any remedy in contract law if the order is not supplied.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The rejoinder to such a person&#8217;s complaint would be framed in terms of the objective test of contractual intention. A reasonable individual in his position would not have imagined that the wine merchant was making an offer to sell, because he would have judged the matter contextually and envisaged the difficulties which Lord Herschell spells out.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">How satisfactory a response would this be? If the law had taken a different view of the status of advertisements, wine merchants and others would quickly have learnt that they had only to insert the words “subject to availability” into their price-lists to be fully protected. Trade could be accomplished more expeditiously, because there would be no need for acknowledgment of the customer&#8217;s order, and the customer would be better protected. The competing merits of the law as it stands and as it might have developed seem fairly finely balanced. <span class="bd">Treitel</span> envisages that in special circumstances the general rule might be disapplied. Commenting on Grainger &amp; Sons v Gough, he suggests (footnote to para 2-010) “quaere whether a price-list sent on request to a single customer could be an offer”.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">However there is a further rationale for the usual view of advertisements as mere invitations to treat. It was memorably expressed in a nineteenth century case when counsel submitted to Parke B that “if a man advertises goods at a certain price, I have a right to go into his shop and demand the article at the price marked”. Parke B replied: “No; if you do, he has a right to turn you out”. The merchant has an interest in being the offeree rather than the offeror, and therefore in being free to accept or reject offers made to him. By the time of the following case, however, it is the interest of the customer which drives the decision.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-17'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Offers - (A) Generally</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Boots, the defendants, ran a self-service shop in which certain drugs were laid out on shelves to which shoppers had access. They selected the goods they wished to buy, placed them in a wire basket, and paid for them at a till, where a registered pharmacist oversaw the transaction and was authorised to prevent a customer from buying a product. Boots was prosecuted under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933, s 18 (1), which provided that it was unlawful to sell items scheduled by the Act “unless the sale [was] effected by or under the supervision of, a registered pharmacist”. The Court of Appeal held that the offence had not been committed, since the sale took place at the till and was therefore duly supervised.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Since the Act&#8217;s reference to “sale” is naturally understood to mean “contract of sale” (see the discussion of <i>Partridge v Crittenden</i> and <i>Fisher v Bell</i> above) the disposal of this case required the Court of Appeal to decide at what point offer and acceptance came together to constitute the contract of sale. Therefore the judgments turn upon express discussion of the nature and timing of invitation to treat, as well as offer and acceptance, in this type of shopping.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The plaintiffs contended that the goods on the shelves constituted an offer which customers accepted by selecting them and placing them in the baskets provided. The Court of Appeal held that this was incorrect; the display of goods amounted to an invitation to treat. It was therefore the customer who offered to buy by presenting selected goods at the till, and the cashier who accepted that offer by ringing up the price of the goods. The consequence of accepting the plaintiffs&#8217; argument was explained by Somervell LJ: “The Lord Chief Justice, I think, expressed one of the most formidable difficulties in the way of the plaintiffs&#8217; contention when he pointed out that, if the plaintiffs are right, once an article has been placed in the receptacle the customer himself is bound and would have no right, without paying for the first article, to substitute an article which he later saw of a similar kind and which he perhaps preferred. I can see no reason for implying from this self-service arrangement any implication other than that which the Lord Chief Justice found in it, namely, that it is a convenient method of enabling customers to see what there is and choose, and possibly put back and substitute, articles which they wish to have, and then to go up to the cashier and offer to buy what they have so far chosen. On that conclusion the case fails, because it is admitted that there was supervision in the sense required by the Act and at the appropriate moment of time”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The established case-law on the status of advertisements and displays of goods leads directly to the conclusion of the court in the Boots case. However, the judges do not confine themselves to following precedent, but go further to analyse the mechanics of self-service shopping. Although it is never expressly stated, there is a matter of great importance at stake here and it informs the analysis. This type of shopping, still fairly new at the time of the litigation, is clearly convenient (Somervell LJ&#8217;s description). Its development furthers trade. It has to be made to work in legal terms. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">A court which failed to make it work would be neglecting its responsibility. Had the case-law suggested that the display of goods was an offer, and that the customer would be bound the moment he took possession of an item, it would have obstructed the development of a trading model which – as it turns out – was so convenient that it was to revolutionise the retail industry. Had it been necessary, a competent court would probably have broken away from inconvenient precedents to reach a decision which enabled self-service trade to go ahead without legal hindrance.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">However, some interesting if minor problems do remain, and are worth considering from a legal standpoint. Poole (Casebook on Contract Law) asks “What is the position if there is a non-self-service counter inside a supermarket? For example, I request that a joint of beef be cut to my specifications but before I reach the cash desk I change my mind. Has a contract of sale already been concluded?”</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Not every display of goods is regarded legally as an invitation to treat, however. You will notice that the court&#8217;s analysis in the <i>Boots</i> case works because (on a very simple level) there are enough stages to the transaction to accommodate the three divisions of the invitation/offer/acceptance analysis. Where there are less than three stages, something has to give. Therefore, as the next case quite memorably establishes, vending machines cannot be categorised as invitations to treat even though they would seem remarkably like displays of goods.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-18'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Offers - (A) Generally</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This is primarily a case on the incorporation of terms into contracts, but that topic is closely linked to the analysis of contract formation. A motorist drove up to the entrance of a car-park. As he did so, a light changed from red to green, and a machine provided a ticket which the motorist took before driving on. In denying that exclusionary words printed on the ticket could be regarded as terms of the contract, Lord <span class="bd">Denning MR</span> explained that the ticket came after the contract was already complete. Therefore, according to basic principles, the ticket could not modify it.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Denning gave the following account of the mechanics of contract formation in this situation: “The customer pays his money and gets a ticket. He cannot refuse it. He cannot get his money back. He may protest to the machine, even swear at it. But it will remain unmoved. He is committed beyond recall. He was committed at the very moment when he put his money into the machine. The contract was concluded at that time. It can be translated into offer and acceptance in this way: the offer is made when the proprietor of the machine holds it out as being ready to receive the money. The acceptance takes place when the customer puts his money into the slot”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">To explain this result, as I did earlier, by pointing out that there are not enough stages to allow for a three-part model of contract formation is not wrong, but it is not the most trenchant of analyses. It would be better to view the matter as follows. In the Thornton scenario, there is only one moment at which a choice is made. That choice has to be labelled the acceptance, because there can be no acceptance without conscious choosing. Any analysis, in any circumstances, which fails to match a purported acceptance to a factual choice, must be wrong as a matter of principle.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Does it matter that the Thornton analysis leaves no room for an invitation to treat? No; as stated earlier, invitations to treat for most purposes have no legal status, and the process of contract formation can perfectly well begin with the making of an offer out of the blue.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Treat the next case as an exercise. More than one analysis could be applied to the facts. The correct analysis is presumably the one which is best adapted to common sense, commercial convenience, and principle. That is not to say that a perfect solution will be available. A balance may have to be struck.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The Council let out deck chairs on a beach. The charge was displayed on a notice by a pile of deck chairs, together with the information that tickets could be obtained from an attendant. The plaintiff sat on a deck chair, which gave way and caused him injury. The Council sought to defend itself by reference to exclusionary words printed on the ticket available from the attendant.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The question here is whether the contract is concluded before or after the customer has the opportunity to see the ticket and its wording. The answer to that question depends on which of the following analyses is correct. (1) The pile of deck chairs is an invitation to treat. The customer makes an offer by sitting down on one of them. The deck chair attendant accepts that offer when he comes round to collect the customer&#8217;s money and provides the ticket. (2) The pile of deck chairs is an offer (there is no invitation to treat). The customer accepts by sitting down on a deck chair. The ticket, when it comes, is post-contractual, and can be regarded as a mere receipt. Its wording therefore has no legal effect.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the first of these accounts, the pile of deck chairs is not difficult to compare with the display of goods in a shop window. There are enough stages to the transaction to match the acceptance with an act of choice by the attendant. However, the first account is not correct.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The court regarded the pile of deck chairs as the offer and the act of sitting down on one of them as the acceptance. The reason was that a customer might sit for an hour or more before the attendant came round for the money. On the first analysis, the customer would be free to get up and walk away at any point without being required to pay (his offer would not yet have been accepted). Perhaps even as the deck chair attendant approached.... Would deck chairs conveniently be provided in public places if that were the law?<br>&emsp;&emsp;You will see that there is room for a little imagination in matching the offer and acceptance analysis to new facts, even though decided cases may give a firm steer in one direction.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Before we turn to consider the way the mechanics of contract formation work in a slightly different factual context (cases involving land) there is a further important category of cases to study. They may often involve advertisements, but work differently from the authorities we have looked at so far. In fact they are regarded as a completely different type of contractual arrangement – the “unilateral contract”. The next decision, which is the leading authority on this category, is also one of the most famous cases in English contract law.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-23'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Offers - (B) In Unilateral Contracts</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The defendants placed an advertisement in the Pall Mall Gazette, inviting people to purchase their product, the Carbolic Smoke Ball. This was a medical preparation which, as the advertisement explained, would protect its users against contracting influenza. The advertisement also stated that a reward of £100 would be paid to any person who caught influenza despite using the smoke ball as directed, and that the company had deposited £1000 with their bankers “shewing our sincerity in this matter”. The plaintiff duly used the smoke ball, caught influenza, claimed the reward, and was refused it. The Court of Appeal, affirming the judgment at first instance, held that the Company was contractually obliged to pay.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The aspect of this case which is chiefly relevant at the moment is the legal status of the Company&#8217;s advertisement. As we have seen, advertisements of goods for sale are generally regarded as invitations to treat rather than offers. This advertisement proved to be an offer. In fact, within the context of the unilateral contract model, advertisements are generally regarded as offers.<br>&emsp;&emsp;To put it very simply, a unilateral contract is one in which the acceptance expected is not to take the form of assent, but of a specified action. This is often referred to as the model of “a promise for an act”. The offer usually is to pay money (or to confer some other benefit) if that action is performed.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The difference between bilateral and unilateral contracts – a first look<br>&emsp;&emsp;We will be examining some aspects of unilateral contracts in more detail later (in particular what constitutes completed acceptance), but a concise account of the fundamental difference between bilateral and unilateral models can be given here. In the bilateral contract, the parties reach an agreement, usually through the exchange of promises which at the moment we are discussing in terms of offer and acceptance. Once the acceptance is made, the parties are legally bound; each can rely on the other&#8217;s future performance, because each will have a remedy in contract law if the other fails to perform. Bilateral contracts have occasionally been labelled “synallagmatic” contracts, because the parties are equally bound in law.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The legal ramifications of unilateral contracts are rather different. Since acceptance takes the form of a specified action rather than the immediate giving of a return promise, there is no reaching of agreement, and the offeror is not bound until the required action is performed (or at least a start has been made upon its performance). Still more strikingly, the offeree is never bound to the offeror, and seems to be able to desist from performance at will.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Bilateral contracts have the great advantage of promoting certainty, because they make the other party&#8217;s behaviour predictable. Unilateral contracts, by contrast, are better used to act as inducements to people to do what they might otherwise not think it worth their while to do. Unilateral contracts are sometimes known as “if” contracts, and tend to amount to this proposition; if you do the following specified act, I will give you a reward. In fact a good many unilateral contract cases concern the offer of rewards. In reward cases, in particular, the offeror may have no interest in who performs the specified act. The point is to provide an inducement generally so that the act is more likely to be performed. Thus offers of unilateral contracts are often “offers to the whole world”, advertised widely, which the person who performs the specified action will thereby accept.<br>&emsp;&emsp;However, they do not have to be offers to the whole world. There are cases in which a promise is made to one party by another while some larger transaction is afoot. Where the promise is made conditional upon the performance of an act, rather than upon the communication of acceptance, it may be interpreted as the offer of a unilateral contract. It may bind the promisor when the act is performed even while the over-arching transaction is not yet complete. For examples, see the cases at the end of this lecture.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As attention moves from cases mainly concerned with displays of goods to cases whose subject matter is land, the rules of the analysis do not change. However, the focus very subtly does begin to shift, away from the timing of the offer, and towards the certainty and completeness which the law requires of a valid offer. The reason for that is that the intention to sell is not difficult to deduce in cases involving goods, price lists and advertisements; the important enquiry is when and how that intention is legally manifested. It is otherwise where the subject-matter of a deal is land. The courts traditionally regard land as unique and not so readily traded. An intention to sell land is not lightly imputed to its owner. The rules of offer and acceptance are arguably applied with a degree of caution to promote certainty and completeness in property dealings. In some of the decided cases, it may be questioned whether they are applied correctly.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-24'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Offers - (C) In Contracts Involving Land</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The following series of telegrams concerning an estate in Jamaica passed between the parties. From H to F: “Will you sell us Bumper Hall Pen? Telegraph lowest cash price”. From F to H: “Lowest price for Bumper Hall Pen £900”. From H to F: “We agree to buy Bumper Hall Pen for the sum of nine hundred pounds asked by you. Please send us your title deed in order that we may get early possession”. Facey later declined to complete the sale. The Privy Council held that he could not be compelled to do so, since no contract had arisen from the exchange of telegrams. H had asked two questions, the first concerning F&#8217;s willingness to sell, and the second as to price. F had answered only the second of those questions, and that communication could not therefore be regarded as an offer to sell. It followed that H&#8217;s reply could not be construed as an acceptance.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;It would be mildly surprising if land could be bought and sold by an exchange as laconic as this (though we should bear in mind that the mode of communication precluded elaborate draftsmanship). And yet one may still wonder at the Privy Council&#8217;s interpretation of Facey&#8217;s reply to Harvey&#8217;s first telegram. It was clear why Harvey was asking about the price. He wanted to buy. It was unclear why Facey would have stated the price in response to Harvey&#8217;s telegram, unless he was content to sell. If he didn&#8217;t want to sell, one would have expected him either not to reply, or to say “Bumper Hall Pen not for sale”. In the circumstances, and adopting the perspective of a reasonable person in Harvey&#8217;s position, would you not have interpreted Facey&#8217;s response as an offer capable of acceptance?</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The defendant later purported to accept this proposal. Held, by the Court of Appeal, that this was merely a preliminary statement as to price, rather than an offer capable of acceptance.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Greene MR explained the court&#8217;s view of the situation as follows: “There is nothing in the world to prevent an owner of an estate of this kind contracting to sell it to a purchaser, who is prepared to spend so large a sum of money, on terms written out on a half sheet of note paper of the most informal description and even, if he likes, on unfavourable conditions. But I think it is legitimate, when approaching the construction of a document of this kind, containing phrases and expressions of doubtful significance, to bear in mind that the probability of parties entering into so large a transaction, and finally binding themselves to a contract of this description couched in such terms, is remote. If they have done it, they have done it, however unwise and however unbusinesslike it may be. The question is, Have they done it?”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Greene&#8217;s statement focuses on the construction of the purported offer, since this was the question for the court&#8217;s determination. The editor of the All England Reports, providing a comment on the decision, lays more emphasis on the context of the transaction: “The word “offer” when used in relation to price by one of the parties to negotiations for the sale of property is not necessarily used as indicating the intention to make a contract on acceptance by the other party. It may be only one element in protracted discussions and its precise effect will depend on the construction of the particular document in which it appears, together with a consideration of the surrounding circumstances. Here it was used by a layman in reference to a large and complicated deal in real property. The document also contained a reference to the preparation of a “schedule of completion” and this is construed to mean the formal contract upon which the solicitors were actually engaged. The letter containing the word “offer” therefore did not amount to a binding offer to sell”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-29'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Offers - (C) In Contracts Involving Land</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Pursuant to its policy of selling its council housing to tenants, the council sent Mr Gibson a letter stating that “the corporation may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price of £2725…”. The letter provided that it was not to be regarded as a firm offer of a mortgage, and went on: “If you would like to make a formal application to buy your council house, please complete the enclosed application form and return it to me as soon as possible”. Mr Gibson filled in the form but left the purchase price blank, asking that certain necessary repairs should be taken into account to diminish the price. The council replied that the state of the property had already been taken into account in the fixing of the price. Mr Gibson then wrote back on 18 March asking to proceed with the purchase in accordance with his original application. Political control of the council later changed and the new policy was that sales would be completed only where the council was legally obliged to proceed. Mr Gibson sought an order of specific performance, obtained it in the Court of Appeal, but lost on the council&#8217;s appeal to the House of Lords. No binding contract had come into existence. The council&#8217;s letter to Mr Gibson did not evince the intention to be bound by his acceptance, because of the words “may be prepared to…”, and its reference to a formal application to buy. It was no more than an invitation to treat.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal decision in this case, which was favourable to Mr Gibson, included a significant and well-known judgment of Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span>&#8216;s for which he was to be criticised in the House of Lords. The salient passage is this: “We have had much discussion as to whether Mr Gibson&#8217;s letter of 18<sup>th</sup> March was a new offer or whether it was an acceptance of the previous offer which had been made. I do not like detailed analyses on such a point. To my mind it is a mistake to think that all contracts can be analysed into the form of offer and acceptance. I know in some of the textbooks it has been the custom to do so; but, as I understand the law, there is no need to look for a strict offer and acceptance. You should look at the correspondence as a whole and at the conduct of the parties and see therefrom whether the parties have come to an agreement on everything that was material. If by their correspondence and their conduct you can see an agreement on all material terms, which was intended thenceforward to be binding, then there is a binding contract in law even though all the formalities have not been gone through. For that proposition I would refer to <i>Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Co</i>.” (Note that Brogden&#8217;s case involved not land, but coal, and an arrangement on which the parties had acted for two years).<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the House of Lords, Lord <span class="bd">Diplock</span> had replied to Lord Denning&#8217;s remarks in these terms: “My Lords, there may be certain types of contract, though I think they are exceptional, which do not fit easily into the normal analysis of a contract being constituted by offer and acceptance; but a contract alleged to have been made by an exchange of correspondence between the parties in which the successive communications other than the first are in reply to one another is not one of these. I can see no reason in the instant case for departing from the conventional approach of looking at the handful of documents relied on as constituting the contract sued on and seeing whether on their true construction there is to be found in them a contractual offer by the council to sell the house to Mr Gibson and an acceptance of that offer by Mr Gibson. I venture to think that it was by departing from this conventional approach that the majority of the Court of Appeal was led into error”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A tension runs through these cases, between on the one hand construing the documents (a narrow view), and on the other hand taking account of context, likelihood, and the overall look of what was going on (a broad view, of course). Linda Mulcahy and John Tillotson, in <i>Contract Law in Perspective</i>, attractively capture these competing views: “Denning is looking for the presence of a cake whereas those adopting a more formalistic analysis have looked for the ingredients of the cake and whether they have been put together in a “correct” sequence”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Ideally, both perspectives should work together, and there should be no tension. On a broad view, it was apparent that the City Council and Mr Gibson both wished to bring about a sale of the council house at the stated price. One might begin from the assumption that since that was what they obviously wanted, it is more likely than not that what they said to each other achieved their aim as a matter of law. If it didn&#8217;t, there may be something wrong with the law. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Lord Diplock, quite correctly looking for the “ingredients of the cake” to see if the cake itself is present, emphasises the cautious words “may be prepared to”. An arch-formalist, ingredient-seeking view would surely note that “may” and “prepared to” are doing the same semantic job, but slightly interfere with each other in the course of it. The council manifestly is prepared to sell Mr Gibson the house; to add that it “may” be prepared to do so simply gainsays the council&#8217;s then policy on the sale of council houses. This is not the best draftsmanship, so should the result of the litigation really turn on it as the key to the council&#8217;s intention? Note that it would have made no sense in the context to state that the council “will” sell the house, because that would presuppose the certainty of Mr Gibson&#8217;s acceptance of the deal. No, once it appears that the parties may not have used language with scientific precision, a broader view should be taken to discover the reality of the situation.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The broader view would note that the transaction was begun by the council sending Mr Gibson details of its sales scheme, and inviting him to fill in an application form if he was interested (invitations to treat, of course). Mr Gibson had done so, and the letter containing the words “may be prepared to” was a response to his application. That letter included the price at which the council was willing to sell, and it was a price which already had factored into it the precise state of Mr Gibson&#8217;s house. Their Lordships&#8217; finding that the willingness of the council to sell was still in doubt at this stage is gainsaid by the broader context of the dealings between the parties. “May be prepared to” is surely a mere form of words, not the happiest, which an official chose because he realised that “will” wouldn&#8217;t make any sense pending Mr Gibson&#8217;s reply. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It is true that the Council&#8217;s letter invited Mr Gibson to make a formal application to buy by completing a further application form, which he never did. But what missing ingredient of the contractual cake could that formal application have supplied?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">We are continuing to distinguish offers and invitations to treat, and more particularly to study the circumstances in which valid offers are recognised by the courts. In the area of auctions and tenders, however, there will sometimes be collateral processes of contract formation taking place at the same time as the main transaction. These are based on the unilateral contract model to which an introduction was given in discussion of <i>Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company</i>. You may want to re-read that material before you go further.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The plaintiff bid 60 guineas for one of the horses, but its current owner, who was present at the sale, promptly bid 61 guineas. The plaintiff refused to make any further bid. The horse was therefore “sold” to its owner (a legal impossibility). The plaintiff claimed that the horse was his since he had been the highest bona fide bidder.

At the outset, notice that the plaintiff was not in a position to make good a claim that the horse had become his; his bid had not been accepted by the auctioneer. Instead, it is held (at least by a majority of the judges involved, and obiter) that the advertisement of the sale as being “without reserve” was an offer which had been accepted by the making of the highest bona fide bid. The auctioneer, by refusing to accept that bid, had breached a contract to the effect that the sale would be without reserve. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to damages for that breach, which would seem to equate to the damages he would have received if he had been able to maintain an action for breach of contract of sale. In fact he had pleaded his case on a different basis (not relevant for present purposes) on which he also succeeded.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">What kind of contract is the one envisaged by the majority, since the plaintiff never expressly accepted any offer made to him, and his offer was not accepted by the auctioneer? It is a unilateral contract – a promise made to whosoever should perform the action of making the highest bona fide bid. It can also be described as a collateral contract, in the sense that its making is intertwined with the stages by which an over-arching transaction progresses (though it was never completed) The decision shows that advertisements are by no means always without legal effect, but it should be compared with the next case.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In <i>Warlow v Harrison</i>, it is only the highest bidder who can perform the act required to make the offer of the unilateral contract binding; there can be only one highest bidder and therefore only one action for breach of contract. In <i>Harris v Nickerson</i>, every person attending the auction would have been enabled to sue the auctioneer for damages had a contract arisen from the advertisement of the goods for sale.

The claimant then bid £200 for each machine, but the auctioneer refused to accept these bids and withdrew the machines from the sale. The claimant sued the auctioneer for breach of contract, arguing that the holding of an auction without reserve amounts to an offer to sell to the highest bidder which he had accepted by making his bids.

Nevertheless, its place is all but taken by the unilateral contract which arises when the sale is described as without reserve, and the bidder makes the highest bid. Damages for the breach of the unilateral contract are the same as they would be had the bilateral contract of sale been made and breached.<br>&emsp;&emsp;You will notice that for the purposes of the bilateral contract the holding of the auction is an invitation to treat, and all bids made at it are offers.

The tenders were to be opened together at a stated time and place. Payment was to be made in cash by the successful bidder. The plaintiffs claimed that they had put in the highest tender, and the defendants were in breach of contract in refusing to sell to them. The court held that no contract had come into existence. The circular could not be construed as an offer to sell to the highest bidder.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Counsel for the plaintiffs in this case attempted to distinguish it from tendering procedures for building contracts. There, he submitted, the price of the bid is not the sole factor by which the successful bidder is chosen, because it is always subject to the architect&#8217;s judgment as to the character and capacity of the builder. This case was different, because there was no such judgment to be exercised, and this was supported by the circular&#8217;s reference to payment in cash. Therefore this case amounted to the offer of a unilateral contract, to be compared to the reward cases. Rejecting this analysis, Willes J said that it would have been apposite if the defendants had expressly bound themselves to accept the highest bid. He went on: “But the question is, whether there is here any offer to enter into a contract at all, or whether the circular amounts to anything more than a mere proclamation that the defendants are ready to chaffer for the sale of the goods, and to receive offers for the purchase of them. In advertisements for tenders for buildings, it is not usual to say that the contract will be given to the lowest bidder, and it is not always that the contract is made with the lowest bidder. Here there is a total absence of any words to intimate that the highest bidder is to be the purchaser. It is a mere attempt to ascertain whether an offer can be obtained within such a margin as the sellers are willing to adopt”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The rule in Spencer v Harding is not open to serious doubt, but the case doesn&#8217;t seem quite as open and shut as it is often thought to be. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it"> Had there been any implication to be drawn from the circular that the stock in trade would be sold to the highest bidder, the unilateral contract device described by counsel for giving contractual effect to that promise would have achieved it. Willes J expressly confirms this. Smith &amp; Thomas&#8217;s Casebook on Contract asks of the case “Would a reasonable reader of the circular have supposed that the defendants intended to make any binding promise? Was it reasonable to suppose that the defendants intended to bind themselves to sell to the highest bidder, however low that bid might be?” Well, the circular stated that the defendants were instructed to offer the stock for sale. Of course that is far from determinative. The tenders were to be opened at a stated time on a given day. That would provide a cut-off point, showing that the defendants were serious about selling the stock and were not merely “ready to chaffer for the sale”. The stipulation for cash reinforces that view; there was to be no chaffering about payment terms by the successful bidder. These were obviously sealed bids, which gave the defendants some protection against being forced to sell at a depressed price; the bidders would each be stating their best price and hoping it would be at a (minimal) premium to what others were prepared to pay. There was no reference to any residual discretion on the part of the defendants to abort the procedure. It has every appearance of a means of achieving, without more, a sale at the best price possible.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The appearance which a bidding process would have for reasonable people was one of the determining factors in the next case.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In 1983 the council contacted the company, amongst others, inviting the submission of tenders to operate the concession for a further period. The invitation stated: “The council do not bind themselves to accept all or any part of any tender. No tender which is received after the last date and time specified shall be admitted for consideration”. The company submitted a tender before the deadline, but as a result of the council&#8217;s mistake it was recorded as arriving late and was not considered. The concession was awarded to another bidder (whose bid was lower than that of the plaintiff, but the higher of the two remaining and “valid” bids). The Court of Appeal held that the invitation to submit tenders was the offer of a unilateral contract accepted by the submission of a conforming tender, and that the council was liable to the company in damages for the breach of that contract.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The council made four submissions. The first, based on <i>Spencer v Harding</i>, was that the invitation to tender was merely an invitation to treat, and not an offer. The second was that the invitation did not state that all tenders would be considered. The third was that the test for the implication of a contract could be no less rigorous than the test for the implication of a term into a contract; it needed to be necessary, and not merely reasonable. The fourth submission, resting upon the other three, was that although the parties might each have assumed that conforming tenders would be considered, they had not contracted to that effect. It would distort the principles of contract formation if the court, out of desire to remedy a perceived injustice, were to find that they had.<br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">Bingham LJ</span> stated that he found great force in these arguments, and had been persuaded by them for much of the hearing, but had ultimately rejected them. He gives his reasons in the following passage:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“A tendering procedure of this kind is, in many respects, heavily weighted in favour of the invitor. He can invite tenders from as many or as few parties as he chooses. He need not tell any of them who else, or how many others, he has invited. The invitee may often, although not here, be put to considerable labour and expense in preparing a tender, ordinarily without recompense if he is unsuccessful. The invitation to tender may itself, in a complex case, although again not here, involve time and expense to prepare, but the invitor does not commit himself to proceed with the project, whatever it is; he need not accept the highest tender; he need not accept any tender; he need not give reasons to justify his acceptance or rejection of any tender received. The risk to which the tenderer is exposed does not end with the risk that his tender may not be the highest (or, as the case may be, lowest). But where, as here, tenders are solicited from selected parties all of them known to the invitor, and where a local authority&#8217;s invitation prescribes a clear, orderly and familiar procedure (draft contract conditions available for inspection and plainly not open to negotiation, a prescribed form of tender, the supply of envelopes designed to protect the absolute anonymity of tenderers and clearly to identify the tender in question and an absolute deadline) the invitee is in my judgment protected at least to this extent: if he submits a confirming tender before the deadline he is entitled, not as a matter of mere expectation but of contractual right, to be sure that his tender will after the deadline be opened and considered in conjunction with all other conforming tenders or at least that his tender will be considered if others are. Had the club, before tendering, inquired of the council whether it could rely on any timely and confirming tender being considered along with others, I feel quite sure that the answer would have been “of course”. The law would, I think, be defective if it did not give effect to that.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is, of course, true that the invitation to tender does not explicitly state that the council will consider timely and conforming tenders. That is why one is concerned with implication. But the council does not either say that it does not bind itself to do so, and in the context a reasonable invitee would understand the invitation to be saying, quite clearly, that if he submitted a timely and conforming tender it would be considered, at least if any other such tender were considered”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The four, forceful submissions made on behalf of the council ultimately depend on one proposition; the council&#8217;s invitation did not contain any promise. This, according to Bingham LJ, is its downfall; the argument proves too much. If it is correct, then it would leave the council at liberty to open the first tender received, before the deadline, and ignore the rest. Alternatively, the council might validly award the concession to a tender received well after the deadline had passed. Bingham LJ could not accept that the council retained the freedom to act in these ways, and said that if it did, “there would in my view be an unacceptable discrepancy between the law of contract and the confident assumptions of commercial parties…”.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">To engage more closely with a case, often one should be ready not only to attend to the details but also to take a broad view of what is going on. Yes, the council&#8217;s submissions are cogent ones, but to gain a victory in these circumstances they would have had to have been quite overwhelming. Justice was entirely on the side of the company, which had done exactly what the council invited it to, only to find that it had wasted its time because of the council&#8217;s own mistake.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Before leaving Blackpool v Fylde, notice the mechanics of liability in this case. The status of the invitation sent by the council differs according to whether it is the substantive or the collateral contract which is under consideration. For the purposes of the substantive contract (the award of the concession) it is an invitation to treat, and the conforming tenders are offers. For the purposes of the collateral contract found by the Court of Appeal, the invitation to tender is an offer of a unilateral contract, which is accepted by all those who submit conforming tenders. Give thought also to the measure of damages to which the plaintiff company would be entitled for breach of the collateral contract. It could not be the total profits to be made from operating the concession, since it was not certain that the company&#8217;s bid would have been accepted even if it had been considered. It would have been a proportion of that profit representing the likelihood of its winning the concession (commonly called “loss of a chance”), or alternatively, its expenses in putting together its bid (reliance loss).</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They stated that they would accept the highest bid. Harvela offered $2,175,000. Sir Leonard offered “$2,100,000 or $101,000 in excess of any other offer…whichever is the higher amount”. The Royal Trust accepted Sir Leonard&#8217;s bid, considering that it was bound to do so. Held, by the House of Lords (reversing the Court of Appeal) that Sir Leonard&#8217;s bid was invalid, so that Harvela&#8217;s was the winner.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This case perhaps does not deserve the prominence it has in some books. Certainly, the complexities caused by Sir Leonard&#8217;s “referential” bid are not of much relevance for present purposes. The outcome can simply be explained by reference to the unilateral contract mechanism, once again; the Royal Trust&#8217;s invitation was the offer of a unilateral contract (to sell to the highest bidder) and was accepted by the submission of the highest bid. That being said, the case is a good opportunity to revise the role of the unilateral contract element within a bidding process.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Smith &amp; Thomas&#8217;s Casebook on Contract fastens on an interesting point, when the following question is posed: “What does [Lord Templeman] mean when he says that referential bids are not “permissible”? Are they illegal?” </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The point may be this; to what extent can the invitation to receive bids condition the validity of the bids received? As long as the invitation is regarded as the offer of a unilateral contract, it can lay down conditions for the validity of the responses to be received, as can any offer. But in the speech of Lord Templeman, a broader view seems to be taken, on which the invitation qualifies the validity of bids simply by being the first shot in the match. There are some suggestions of this in the Blackpool case as well, introduced by references to “conforming” tenders. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">An invitation to receive bids is normally understood to be a mere invitation to treat, although for some purposes of course it can also be the offer of a unilateral contract. Where it lays down complex conditions of validity, is it still in any sense just an invitation to treat? Can an invitation to treat determine the question of whether a response to it counts as an offer or not?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The problem of deciding whether controlling power belongs to the first or to subsequent shots in the match will be considered in detail in the next lecture. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The defendant wrote to the plaintiff offering to sell him his farm for £1000. The plaintiff&#8217;s agent replied saying that the plaintiff would buy it for £950. The defendant later wrote to say that he would not sell at that price. The plaintiff then wrote to say that he would buy for £1000. Specific performance was refused, since there was no concluded contract of sale.

Bear in mind, though, that had the defendant still been content to sell his farm to the plaintiff for the original price once the plaintiff finally offered it, all he needed to do to close the deal on those terms was to write back to accept.

On Monday, Stevenson replied asking “whether you would accept forty for delivery over two months, or if not, longest limit you would give”. On receipt of this reply, McLean sold the iron to a third party. In the ensuing minutes, and before McLean informed Stevenson that the iron was sold, Stevenson affirmed that he would pay 40 shillings a ton. McLean sought to defend an action for breach of contract by arguing that Stevenson&#8217;s enquiry about delivery times had terminated the original offer, so that it was no longer on the table when Stevenson purported to accept it. Held that Stevenson&#8217;s enquiry had not been a counter-offer. His later telegram was therefore acceptance of the original offer.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;In Lush J&#8217;s explanation of the grounds for his decision there are a couple of odd expressions for which I have suggested preferable readings: “It is apparent throughout the correspondence, that the plaintiffs did not contemplate buying the iron on speculation, but that their acceptance of the defendant&#8217;s offer depended on their finding someone to take the warrants off their hands. All parties knew that the market was in an unsettled state, and that no one could predict at the early hour when the telegram was sent how the prices would range during the day. It was reasonable that, under these circumstances, they should desire to know before business began whether they were to be at liberty in case of need to make <i>[read “obtain”]</i> any concession as to the time or times of delivery, which would be the times of payment, or whether the defendant was determined to adhere to the terms of his letter; and it was highly unreasonable <i>[read “unlikely]</i> that the plaintiffs should have intended to close the negotiation while it was uncertain whether they could find a buyer or not, having the whole of the business hours of the day to look for one. Then, again, the form of the telegram is one of inquiry. It is not like “I offer forty for delivery over two months,” which would have likened the case to <i>Hyde v Wrench</i>…. Here there is no counter proposal….There is nothing specific by way of offer or rejection, but a mere inquiry, which should have been answered and not treated as a rejection of the offer”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Notice the two grounds on which the decision is based – the context of the negotiation, and the form and substance of Stevenson&#8217;s response. Sometimes, in explanations of counter-offer analysis, the importance of context is not sufficiently stressed. This was a volatile market, and Stevenson, as purchaser, had the complex task of balancing the price being asked against the ease (or otherwise) with which the warrants could be sold on. In these circumstances, an understandable request for further information should have been treated as just that, and not as the proposal of a different deal.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look </span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It will be apparent that in some circumstances it may not be easy to distinguish between a counter offer and a request for further information. When attempting to draw the distinction correctly, you may want to bear in mind the potentially drastic consequence of labelling a communication as a counter offer, and check that this is a reasonable way of describing what has occurred. Remember that a counter offer does not merely fall short of an acceptance. In law it is a rejection of the original offer, and terminates it. Does the offeree really mean to reject the original offer in all its respects, to replace it by a proposal of his own? Possibly; but the effect which the traditional analysis gives to counter offers makes a negotiation look curiously like a prize fight. Some negotiations are like that, but many are not. Always consider the context.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">We have already looked at a case in which there is a live issue as to whether a counter-offer is being made or not. Here are the facts of <i>Gibson</i>&#8216;s case again, in case you want to refresh your memory. If you are already familiar with them, skip to the discussion below. It is well worth forming your own view on the issue, because two senior judges were in disagreement over it.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The letter provided that it was not to be regarded as a firm offer of a mortgage, and went on: “If you would like to make a formal application to buy your council house, please complete the enclosed application form and return it to me as soon as possible”. Mr Gibson filled in the form but left the purchase price blank, asking that certain necessary repairs should be taken into account to diminish the price. The council replied that the state of the property had already been taken into account in the fixing of the price. Mr Gibson then wrote back on 18 March asking to proceed with the purchase in accordance with his original application. Political control of the council later changed and the new policy was that sales would be completed only where the council was legally obliged to proceed. Mr Gibson sought an order of specific performance, obtained it in the Court of Appeal, but lost on the council&#8217;s appeal to the House of Lords. No binding contract had come into existence. The council&#8217;s letter to Mr Gibson did not evince the intention to be bound by his acceptance, because of the words “may be prepared to…”, and its reference to a formal application to buy. It was no more than an invitation to treat.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;When Mr Gibson replied to the council, proposing that the price of the house should be diminished to take account of the need for repairs, was that a counter-offer? The precise words used by him were these: “Before the transaction is finalised I would appreciate your comments on the following. [There followed a complaint that, although the council&#8217;s “direct works” department had undertaken to repair Mr Gibson&#8217;s tarmac paths, nothing had been done.] I would therefore like your assurance that Direct Works will not exclude these premises when re-surfacing or re-laying starts, or alternatively would you deduct an amount of money from the purchase price and I will undertake the repairs myself. Whichever decision you arrive at I would like to make an initial cash payment of £500 – so I would be obliged if you will let me have the figures to allow for the deposit mentioned. I have left the purchase price blank on the application form until I hear from you”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the Court of Appeal Geoffrey Lane LJ (dissenting) made this comment on Mr Gibson&#8217;s proposal: “What he is suggesting there in short is that the price of these premises to him should not be that which the council have put forward but that an allowance should be made for his repairing the drive or alternatively there should be an obligation on the council to make recompense to him in kind by repairing his drive themselves by direct labour. That seemed to me quite plainly to be a counter-offer”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the House of Lords Lord Edmund Davies went the other way: “I am not, however, with Geoffrey Lane LJ in treating Mr Gibson&#8217;s letter of 5<sup>th</sup> March 1971 (regarding non-repair of his tarmac paths) as a counter-offer which had the effect of destroying an offer to sell, if the council had made one. On the contrary, I read it as merely exploratory of the possibility of a reduction in price in the eventuality indicated. In other words, this case is like <i>Stevenson v McLean</i> and unlike <i>Hyde v Wrench</i>”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The concept of a counter-offer, terminating the original offer but itself open for acceptance, lies at the heart of the situation known as the “battle of the forms”. This occurs where parties do business together, but while appearing to go through the process of offer and acceptance, they exchange paperwork which in fact constitutes a written (and perhaps unwitting) dispute over whose terms are to govern the deal.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The question arose whether the contract of bailment between the parties was made on the plaintiffs&#8217; or the defendants&#8217; conditions, since the latter included a limitation of liability to £800 per ton of goods. The contract was formed when the plaintiffs&#8217; driver brought his delivery note to the defendants&#8217; office; the note stated that “all goods are carried on the [plaintiffs&#8217;] conditions of carriage”. The defendants gave permission for the goods to be brought into the warehouse, but stamped the delivery note with the words “received under A.V.C conditions”. Held by the Court of Appeal that the defendants&#8217; conditions prevailed over those of the plaintiffs.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The legal explanation for the decision is this. The giving in of the delivery note is an offer. However, the stamping of it by the other party is not an acceptance of that offer but a counter-offer, because of the discrepancy between the two sets of terms. The acceptance of this counter-offer is made by the plaintiff&#8217;s driver when he drives the lorry into the warehouse. That is an <i>acceptance by conduct</i> – more will be said about this topic at the beginning of the next lecture.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The <i>Arthur Crutchley</i> case is not a complex one on this point. It can be seen to apply a general principle; the latest shot in a battle of the forms tends to prevail, because the doctrine of counter-offer dictates that it represents the current offer on the table between the parties and terminates earlier ones.<br>&emsp;&emsp;However, the situation becomes somewhat more difficult and open to doubt when one party&#8217;s paperwork claims to trump future inconsistent proposals prospectively.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

On the back of their quotation (regarded as the offer) were various clauses including (a) a price escalation provision which would entitle them to demand an increased price if production costs increased; and (b) the statement that “all orders are accepted only upon and subject to the terms set out in our quotation and the following conditions. These terms and conditions shall prevail over any terms and conditions in the buyer&#8217;s order”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The buyers placed an order which was expressed to be on their own terms and conditions, and varied the delivery date. There was a tear-off slip which was to be signed and sent back. It reiterated that the order was accepted on the buyers&#8217; own terms. The sellers signed and returned it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Upon delivery of the machine tool, the sellers sought to increase the price by reference to their price escalation clause. Held by the Court of Appeal that the buyers&#8217; terms governed, so that the sale was at the originally quoted price.

In the opinion of all three judges in the Court of Appeal (differing from the analysis of the judge at first instance), the buyers&#8217; order was so materially different from the sellers&#8217; offer that it could not be construed as an acceptance of it. Instead, it was a counter-offer which terminated it, and therefore also terminated the claim in that original offer that the sellers&#8217; terms should prevail over those of the buyer. By signing the tear-off slip, the sellers had (ostensibly) assented to that counter-offer.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">All three Court of Appeal judges emphasise that provisions in the buyers&#8217; order (eg. with regard to delivery date) materially differed from provisions in the sellers&#8217; quotation. As a result of that, it seems, the order is characterised as a counter-offer and therefore has the effect of terminating the sellers&#8217; offer. But is this analysis perhaps more complex than necessary? The buyers&#8217; order, by specifying that their terms would prevail, ran counter to the sellers&#8217; offer for that reason alone, and was therefore a counter-offer.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The sellers (Amphenol) claimed that the governing terms were their own, referred to on their acknowledgment of purchase orders, and limited or excluded their liability for breach.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Held at first instance (HHJ Simon Brown QC) that the usual battle of the forms analysis was displaced here.

It was impermissible in effect to disregard the reference to Amphenol&#8217;s terms on the acknowledgment of purchase. The fact that Amphenol had not placed any reliance on its terms in correspondence after the dispute arose was of no obvious relevance.

The offer was to remain open for six weeks. Before the expiry of that period, the defendant withdrew the offer. Towards the end of the six week period, the plaintiff purported to accept the offer. Held, rejecting the plaintiff&#8217;s claim to enforce a contract, that “if six weeks are given on one side to accept an offer, the other has six weeks to put an end to it” (Best CJ).</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;It may seem surprising that an offeror can expressly define the length of time for which he will keep an offer open, and then withdraw the offer during that period with impunity. No doubt many an offeree on the receiving end of such behaviour would resent it and wonder how it is legally permissible; he may have relied on having the full period in which to make up his mind, or why else would he have been informed of the offer&#8217;s duration? The legally correct answer is no more than a restatement of the principle set out at the beginning of this lecture. The reason that such behaviour is permissible lies principally in the law of consideration. As a matter of legal doctrine, a promise does not bind its maker unless he requests and receives something in return for it (consideration). We will, of course, be looking in detail at the law of consideration later this term. Until that time, be sure to remember that a “gratuitous promise”, meaning one which is not given in exchange for anything, does not bind, however sincerely it is meant or emphatically expressed.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look </span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">If you read the judgment in this case, you will see how completely it is imbued with the understanding of contract as mutuality of obligation. Best CJ does not refer expressly to the doctrine of consideration, but puts it more broadly; “one party cannot be bound without the other”. It is worth noting the date of the case – 1828. The unilateral contract model had not yet developed, and perhaps would have been rejected outright by Best CJ on the footing that it can (at least on one view) involve one party being bound while the other is not. This is more fully explored below: see Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Note also the way in which the use of terminology has altered since the time of this judgment. Best CJ says that the defendant “repudiated the contract on April 9”. We would now regard that expression as unfortunate, since the whole point is that no form of contractual obligation ever came into existence. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

This was an offer to sell property, expressed to remain open for six months. However, the prospective purchaser paid £1 in return for this promise. Held that this consideration, although nominal, converted the offer into an option (a binding contract), so that the offeror was not free to withdraw it during the six month period.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If an offer is to be effectively withdrawn, its revocation must be communicated to the offeree.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He examined various persuasive authorities (American law, academic writing and principles governing acceptance) and rejected the submission that an uncommunicated withdrawal was valid: “If the defendants&#8217; contention were to prevail no person who had received an offer by post and had accepted it would know his position until he had waited such a time as to be quite sure that a letter withdrawing the offer had not been posted before his acceptance of it. It appears to me that both legal principles, and practical convenience require that a person who has accepted an offer not know to him to have been revoked, shall be in a position safely to act upon the footing that the offer and acceptance constitute a contract binding on both parties”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look </span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">This decision seems so obviously in accordance with practicality and fairness that you may wonder whether there are any arguments at all in favour of the offerors&#8217; (the defendants&#8217;) contention. To the mind of an English common lawyer, perhaps not. However, this is an occasion on which the principle that the parties must be <b>ad idem</b> can be pressed into service to attempt to make the defendants&#8217; case. Of course there is no point at which they and the other side were <b>ad idem</b>. But the principle or ideal of being <b>ad idem</b> is tempered by English contract law&#8217;s concern with objective appearances. To a reasonable person in the offeree&#8217;s position, the parties appear to be <b>ad idem</b>, and it is that appearance which is determinative. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Although withdrawal of offer must be communicated to the offeree, the communication need not be either formal or direct.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It was expressed to be open until a stated deadline. The day before the deadline expired, the plaintiff was informed by somebody else that the offeror was now offering the property to a third party. In fact an agreement for sale was concluded with the third party on that day. The next day, the plaintiff purported to accept the offer before the deadline expired. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against the order for specific performance granted by the trial judge. No contract had come into being between the parties. The plaintiff had known, when he purported to accept, that the offeror was no longer minded to sell to him. In these circumstances, the offer had effectively been withdrawn.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;James LJ explained the principle on which he decided this case as follows: “It appears to me that there is neither principle or authority for the proposition that there must be an express and actual withdrawal of the offer, or what is called a retractation. It must, to constitute a contract, appear that the two minds were at one, at the same moment of time, that is, that there was an offer continuing up to the time of the acceptance. If there was not such a continuing offer, then the acceptance comes to nothing. Of course it may well be that the one man is bound in some way or other to let the other man know that his mind with regard to the offer has changed; but in this case, beyond all question, the Plaintiff knew that Dodds was no longer minded to sell the property to him as plainly and clearly as if Dodds had told him in so many words, “I withdraw the offer”. This is evident from the Plaintiff&#8217;s own statements in the bill”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This case slots quite neatly into place provided it is seen in the same light as the “snapping up” cases which were covered in the last lecture. The plaintiff here is quite as unable to accept an offer which he knows no longer tallies with its maker&#8217;s true intention as is an offeree who tries to snap up an offer which is clearly made by mistake.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">However, that is not quite the basis on which James LJ puts his judgment. Rather, the <b>ad idem</b> principle again makes an appearance; there must be at least a moment in time when the two parties are of the same mind, and here there is not. But nor was there any such moment in Byrne v Van Tienhoven, yet there a contract was found. Can the two cases be reconciled?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">They probably can. Certainly each seems to be rightly decided. In Byrne, the offeree accepts thinking that there is still an offer on the table. In Dickinson v Dodds, the offeree accepts thinking that there is probably not an offer on the table. Convenience and fairness justify the result in the first case. The principle lying behind the snapping up cases justifies the result in the second. They can be reconciled on the basis that both are expressions of the objective perspective on intention, limited always by the gloss that the objective view must be the one that is reasonable to take on the known facts.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">There is more to be said about Dickinson v Dodds. It must have appeared on the evidence that the plaintiff knew the deal with the third party was as good as done. Otherwise, it is hard to explain why the mere knowledge that the property had been <b>offered </b>elsewhere should have fixed the plaintiff with the realisation that it was no longer being offered to him (this point is correctly taken in Beale, Bishop &amp; Furmston&#8217;s Contract Cases and Materials). Offers to sell the same property might quite well be made to more than one party, although this would be a risky tactic since it could result in multiple and mutually exclusive contracts. Casebook accounts of Dickinson v Dodds seem to understate how much the court must have found the plaintiff to know about the offeror&#8217;s change of heart. For the correct account, see the final sentence in the quotation from James LJ&#8217;s judgment above.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">On a separate point, note the statement in Mellish LJ&#8217;s judgment that “the sale of the property to Allan [the third party] was first in point of time”. This needs careful handling. One might conclude that the contract made first, where there are offers out to multiple offerees, takes precedence over later acceptances involving the same property. This is true as a matter of equity only (and Dickinson v Dodds was an action for the equitable remedy of specific performance). It is not true of common law, which takes no account of precedence. It regards mutually inconsistent contracts as equally valid, leaving up to the parties involved the choice of which to perform and which to breach. <span class="bd">Treitel</span>, at para 2-033, obscures this point, citing a case (Potter v Sanders) as if it established a general principle of precedence. It does not; the case is concerned only with an equitable remedy. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

No deadline for the receipt of the information was given. Seven months later, an order revoking the offer of reward was published. The following year, the claimant gave relevant information to the authorities.

To assess this assertion in its context, one should bear in mind that many offers of unilateral contracts, like the one in this case, are made generally, to “the whole world”. There must be freedom to withdraw such an offer, because basic contractual principle dictates that any offer can be withdrawn provided it has not yet been accepted, and provided the offeror is not found to have contracted to keep the offer open. Since it would be impractical if not impossible to communicate the fact of withdrawal individually to every person who may have seen the offer, the rule is that a withdrawal published in the same way that the offer was originally made will be effective.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where an offer is not limited in duration, the rule is that it lapses after the expiration of a reasonable time.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He heard nothing more until 23 November 1864, when the company sent him a letter asking him to pay for the shares (this letter was putatively the acceptance). The defendant no longer wanted the shares, and argued that his offer had lapsed before acceptance was made. A very briefly reported judgment affirmed that he was correct.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look </span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It may be of interest to see the way in which a later judge examines the underlying rationale for this rule. The rule itself is uncontroversial, and it may well be that little will turn on what ground it is put, but the following passage from Buckley J&#8217;s judgment in Manchester Diocesan Council for Education v Commercial and General Investments (1970) gives some insight into the values which inform a mid-twentieth century consideration of contract formation: “There appear to me to be two possible views on methods of approaching the problem. First, it may be said that by implication the offer is made on terms that, if it is not accepted within a reasonable time, it must be treated as withdrawn. Alternatively, it may be said that, if the offeree does not accept the offer within a reasonable time, he must be treated as having refused it. On either view the offer would cease to be a live one on the expiration of what in the circumstances of the particular case should be regarded as a reasonable time for acceptance. The first of these alternatives involves implying a term that if the offer is not accepted within a reasonable time, it shall be treated as withdrawn or lapsing at the end of that period if it has not then been accepted; the second is based on an inference to be drawn from the conduct of the offeree, that is, that having failed to accept the offer within a reasonable time he has manifested an intention to refuse it. If, in the first alternative, the time which the offeror is to be treated as having set for acceptance is to be such a time as is reasonable at the date of the offer, what is reasonable must depend on circumstances then existing and reasonably likely to arise during the continuance of the offer; but it would not be unlikely that the offeror and offeree would make different assessments of what would be reasonable even if, as might quite possibly not be the case, they based those judgments on identical known and anticipated circumstances. No doubt a court could resolve any dispute about this, but this approach clearly involves a certain degree of uncertainty about the precise terms of the offer. […] The second alternative on the other hand involves simply an objective assessment of facts and the determination of the question whether on the facts the offeree should in fairness to both parties be regarded as having refused the offer.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It does not seem to me that either party is in greater need of protection by the law in this respect than the other. Until his offer has been accepted it is open to the offeror at any time to withdraw it or to put a limit on the time for acceptance. On the other hand, the offeree can at any time refuse the offer, or, unless he has been guilty of unreasonable delay, accept it. Neither party is at a disadvantage. Unless authority constrains me to do otherwise, I am strongly disposed to prefer the second alternative to the first”.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The plaintiffs ran into financial difficulties while working for the defendants, partly because the parties had agreed an unusually low price for the work, and partly because the plaintiffs failed to supervise their workers properly. The defendants would be liable to penalties if the work were not done on time. They therefore agreed to pay more money in return for the plaintiffs finishing their work by the contractual deadline. The defendants failed to pay, and argued that the plaintiffs had given no consideration for the promise to pay more, since they were to do nothing other than what they were already bound by contract to do anyway. The Court of Appeal held that the promise to pay more was enforceable. The principle of <i>Stilk v Myrick</i> remained good law, so that a gratuitous promise was not enforceable (unless made in a deed). Where, however, the promise conferred a practical advantage on the promisor, the court would find that it was supported by consideration. Here the defendants benefited from their promise in that they avoided liability to a penalty for late completion. They also obtained a more formalised relationship with the plaintiffs, and therefore more control over their work.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;(i) If A has entered into a contract with B to do work for, or to supply goods or services to B in return for payment by B, and<br>&emsp;&emsp;(ii) at some stage before A has completely performed his obligations under the contract B has reason to doubt whether A will, or will be able to, complete his side of the bargain, and<br>&emsp;&emsp;(iii) B thereupon promises A an additional payment in return for A&#8217;s promise to perform his contractual obligations on time and<br>&emsp;&emsp;(iv) as a result of giving his promise B obtains in practice a benefit, or obviates a disbenefit, and<br>&emsp;&emsp;(v) B&#8217;s promise is not given as a result of economic duress or fraud on the part of A, then<br>&emsp;&emsp;(vi) the benefit to B is capable of being consideration for B&#8217;s promise, so that the promise will be legally binding.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Williams v Roffey</i> is a controversial case because it allows a promisee to enforce a promise even though he is doing nothing more in return for it than he was already obliged to do. Whether this is a proper legal development must depend on the view one takes of what consideration is, and the role that it plays or ought to play in the law.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If consideration is a body of technical rules, this case appears to breach them. This is the view of Professor Coote, who argues that the case purports to abolish the need for consideration to support the variation of contracts. If, as Russell LJ says in <i>Williams v Roffey</i>, the assessment of consideration should reflect the parties&#8217; intentions, then there is certainly consideration on these facts – but the doctrine now seems virtually to have merged with the parallel analysis of intention to create legal relations (the subject of the next lecture).<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the first condition of his six-part statement of principle in <i>Williams v Roffey</i>, Glidewell LJ carefully limits its application to cases in which the promisee has undertaken to do work for, or to supply good or services to the promisor. The ratio of the case therefore does not cover an undertaking to pay money to the promisor. An attempt to extend <i>Williams v Roffey</i> to cases involving obligations of debt was made and rejected in <i>Re Selectmove</i> (already cited in an earlier lecture, on the issue of acceptance by silence). Part payment of debt is governed by the House of Lords&#8217; decision in <i>Foakes v Beer</i>, and that prevents extension of the reasoning in <i>Williams v Roffey</i> into this area. <i>Foakes v Beer</i> will be examined in its own right very shortly.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

One offered to sell for 69 shillings a ton. Before that letter arrived, the other wrote offering to buy at the same price. In fact the second letter was interpreted by the majority of the court as a counter offer, because it also referred to obtaining more iron at a lower price, but the problem of identical offers crossing in the post was dealt with, obiter, by the majority. They decided that such cross-offers did not form a contract. A further communication would be needed by way of response to one of the two offers.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Blackburn J, in the majority, explained his view of the situation as follows: “When a contract is made between two parties there is a promise by one in consideration of the promise made by the other; there are two assenting minds, the parties agreeing in opinion, and one having promised in consideration of the promise of the other – there is an exchange of promises; but I do not think exchanging offers would, upon principle, be at all the same thing…. The promise or offer being made on each side in ignorance of the promise or offer made on the other side neither of them can be construed as an acceptance of the other. Either of the parties may write and say “I accept your offer, and, as you perceive, I have already made a similar offer to you,” and then people would know what they were about…”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Honyman J, dissenting on this issue, said this: “I cannot see why the fact of the letters crossing each other should not make a good contract. If I say I am willing to buy a man&#8217;s house on certain terms and he at the same moment says he is willing to sell it, and these two letters are posted so that they are irrevocable with respect to the writers, why should that not constitute a good contract? The parties are <i>ad idem</i> at one and the same moment”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Blackburn J&#8217;s opinion, requiring the exchange of promises, is strongly reliant on the principle of consideration or bargain. This is not surprising, since the account of contracts as bargains enjoyed its greatest prestige at this time. However, it is not altogether obvious why agreement must necessarily take the form of bargain; agreement is a fact, however it comes about. Grove J goes even further, requiring there to have been an opportunity for “consideration” by which he clearly means “reflection”, before an offer can be accepted. This is certainly not what “consideration” usually means in a contractual context. One is left with the impression that the emerging “principles” of contract law have not yet acquired wholly stable meanings at the time of this case. Nowadays, one would simply analyse the situation in Tinn v <span class="bd">Hoffman</span> in terms of the need for communication, and the need for reasonable certainty. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Honyman J, dissenting, applies a well-recognised principle, but again arguably allows it to take inappropriate control of the analysis. In his view if the parties are <b>ad idem</b> that is all that is necessary; there must therefore be a contract. We have already seen that being <b>ad idem</b> works best as an ideal in contract law, explaining for instance why the courts attribute legal consequences to agreements. It words less well as an analytic tool. Here, it leads Honyman J to find the parties bound to each other when neither yet knows of it. That is not a sensible result.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In the next case, it is confirmed that knowledge of an offer is required before it can be validly accepted.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Clarke did give the information, but later admitted that his only reason for doing so had been to clear himself of a charge of murder. He later sued the Crown for the reward, although he conceded that he had not had the reward in mind at the time he came forward with the information.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Held that he had not validly accepted the offer of the reward. He had been unaware of the existence of the offer; to have forgotten about it was the same as never knowing of it.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This seems to be a clear case, but some commentators do not regard it as such. Bishop, Beale and Furmston (<i>Contract Cases and Materials</i>) conclude that “it is not necessary that the offer is the main motivation for the offeree acting, provided he or she is aware of the offer”. However<i>, R v Clarke</i> and <i>Williams v Carwardine</i> decide that motivation is irrelevant, as long as there is factual awareness of the offer. <span class="bd">McKendrick</span>, quoting <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> (ed. Beale), states that: “ an act which is wholly motivated by factors other than the existence of the offer cannot amount to an acceptance; but if the existence of the offer plays some part, however small, in inducing a person to do the required act, there is a valid acceptance of the offer”. Apart from the fact that it is unattractive to have to distinguish between the absence of a motive and its presence to a vanishingly small extent, <i>R v Clarke</i> does not support Chitty&#8217;s view. Motive is irrelevant, providing there is knowledge of the offer.<br>&emsp;&emsp;An overview of the nature of unilateral contracts has already been given. Now the subject must be revisited in somewhat greater detail, because the location of the moment of acceptance in these arrangements has proved problematic.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The offer of a unilateral contract is a promise to pay money, or to confer some other benefit, provided the offeree behaves in a certain way. The required behaviour amounts to the performance of a <i>condition</i>. The offeror is not obliged to honour his promise until the condition is fully performed – this is uncontroversial. The difficulty consists in deciding at what moment the offer of the unilateral contract is accepted, and therefore, until what point the offeror remains free to withdraw the offer. On a strict view, which receives some support from the decided cases, acceptance only takes place when the condition is fully performed. More recent authority suggests that there is acceptance as soon as the offeree embarks on performance of the condition.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The problem with the strict view is traditionally expressed in the “walk to York” example. The offeror promises the offeree a sum of money if the offeree will walk to York. May the offeror really take advantage of the rules of contract formation to act on a change of mind and withdraw that offer as the offeree approaches York? If acceptance requires arrival at York, the answer seems to be yes.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They arranged with the respondent that if he introduced a purchaser who did indeed go on to purchase the cinemas, they would pay him £10,000 commission. The respondent did introduce a willing purchaser, but the appellants disposed of the cinemas to another party. The respondent claimed the commission, or alternatively damages, arguing that a term should be implied into the contract that the appellants would “do nothing to prevent the satisfactory completion of the transaction so as to deprive the respondent of the agreed commission”. The House of Lords found for the appellants, denying that commission was payable unless the respondent&#8217;s client bought the cinemas, and rejecting the proposed implied term.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This case can be taken as deciding that (at least on its own facts) there was no acceptance of the offer of a unilateral contract until the condition were fully performed, so that until that time the offeror could withdraw the offer or render its acceptance impossible. However, the reasoning in the case is not predominantly along those lines. It largely turns on whether the implied term contended for by the respondent can properly be introduced into the contract. To understand the House of Lords&#8217; decision that it cannot, it is essential to realise that the test for the implying of a term into a contract is <i>necessity</i>. If it is not possible to discharge the heavy burden of demonstrating that the implication of a term is necessary, it will not be implied even though it might be thought a reasonable or attractive improvement to the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is in this light that the following passage from the speech of Lord Russell of Killowen should be read: “I can find no safe ground on which to base the introduction of any such implied term. Implied terms, as we all know, can only be justified under the compulsion of some necessity. No such compulsion or necessity exists in the case under consideration. The agent is promised a commission if he introduces a purchaser at a specified or minimum price. The owner is desirous of selling. The chances are largely in favour of the deal going through, if a purchaser is introduced. […] A sum of £10,000 (the equivalent of the remuneration of a year&#8217;s work by a Lord Chancellor) for work done within a period of eight or nine days is no mean reward, and is one well worth a risk. There is no lack of business efficacy in such a contract <i>[read “arrangement”]</i>, even though the principal is free to refuse to sell to the agent&#8217;s client”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Lord Russell also deals with the contention that there ought to be a claim in quasi contract/restitution on a <b>quantum meruit</b> (“how much the claimant deserved to be paid”) if the offeror fails to allow the sale to go through. A <b>quantum meruit</b> action is not available here, because the offer of the unilateral contract itself fully specifies the condition on which commission will be payable, and cannot be circumvented merely because the condition has not been fulfilled.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They began to pay the mortgage in instalments, but before it was fully paid off, the father died and his widow brought an action for possession of the house against the daughter-in-law. The action failed; the offer to transfer the house was an offer of a unilateral contract which was accepted by the couple as soon as they began to pay off the mortgage.

They attended on time with the required documents, but the defendants refused to exchange contracts, asserted that exchange was part of the condition of the contract, and thus argued that they had validly withdrawn their offer before completion of its condition. Held that there was complete performance of the stated condition, so that the attempted withdrawal came too late. However, if that were wrong, the defendants were at any event not free to prevent fulfilment of the condition. There was an implied, subsidiary promise that once performance of the condition had begun, its completion would not be prevented. This implied promise was accepted by embarking on performance.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The primary resolution of the issue at stake, and the further point of principle, are explained by Goff LJ: “The concept of a unilateral or “if” contract is somewhat anomalous, because it is clear that, at all events, until the offeree starts to perform the condition, there is no contract at all, but merely an offer which the offeror is free to revoke. Doubts have been expressed whether the offeror becomes bound so soon as the offeree starts to perform or satisfy the condition, or only when he has fully done so. In my judgment, however, we are not concerned in this case with any such problem, because in my view the plaintiffs had fully performed or satisfied the condition when they presented themselves with a banker&#8217;s draft for the deposit and their part of the written contract for sale duly engrossed and signed, and there tendered the same, which I understand to mean proffered it for exchange. Actual exchange, which never took place, would not in my view have been part of the satisfaction of the condition but something additional which was inherently necessary to be done by the plaintiffs to enable, not to bind, the defendants to perform the unilateral contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Even if my reasoning so far be wrong the conclusion in my view is still the same for the following reasons. Whilst I think that the true view of a unilateral contract must in general be that the offeror is entitled to require full performance of the condition which he has imposed and short of that he is not bound, that must be subject to an important qualification, which stems from the fact that there must be an implied obligation on the part of the offeror not to prevent the condition becoming satisfied, which obligation it seems to me must arise as soon as the offeree starts to perform. Until then the offeror can revoke the whole thing, but once the offeree has embarked on performance it is too late for the offeror to revoke his offer.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look </span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Must there be such an implied obligation? There are hints in earlier cases that Goff LJ is not alone in thinking that there must. In Offord v Davies (1962), Erle CJ said of the offer of a unilateral contract that “This promise by itself creates no obligation. It is in effect conditioned to be binding if the plaintiff acts upon it, either to the benefit of the defendants, or to the detriment of himself. But, <b>until the condition has been at least in part fulfilled</b>, the defendants have the power of revoking it”. There is further discussion in that case tending the same way. In Shuey v United States (above), Strong J said of another offer of a unilateral contract: “It is not to be doubted that the offer was revocable at any time before it was accepted, <b>and before anything had been done in reliance upon it</b>”. Goff LJ&#8217;s device certainly works from the technical point of view. It is a similar mechanism to the one by which <span class="bd">Bingham MR</span> gave binding effect to the arrangement for dealing with tenders in Blackpool &amp; Fylde (Lecture 2).</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">On the other hand, can Goff LJ&#8217;s principle stand with the decision of the House of Lords in Luxor v Cooper, where the need to imply such an obligation was considered and rejected? Even if it can, by virtually confining the earlier decision to its own facts, Daulia comes close to upsetting other authorities. Could it be used to generate a different outcome to the problem in Routledge v Grant (above)?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Luxor v Cooper was not cited in Daulia. That may seem to weaken the case, particularly when taken in combination with the fact that Goff LJ&#8217;s principle was in his own opinion unnecessary for the disposal of the case, and therefore obiter. However, Goff LJ is most unlikely to have been personally ignorant of House of Lords authority. The very fact that he chose to make a declaration of principle in Daulia when the case did not strictly require it adds urgency to his view. If a choice has to be made between the line taken in Luxor, and that of Daulia, (leaving to one side the vital matter of context), Daulia should probably be preferred. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It is worth standing back to survey the walk to York once again. Professor Maurice Wormser, in “The True Conception of Unilateral Contracts” (26 Yale Law Journal 136) does just that, using the American equivalent of the Walk and the late withdrawal of the promise to remunerate it. He is still persuaded by the strict view:</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">“The objection is made, however, that it is very “hard” upon B that he should have walked half-way across the Brooklyn Bridge and should get no compensation. This suggestion, invariably advanced, might be dismissed with the remark that “hard” cases should not make bad law. But going a step further, by way of reply, the pertinent inquiry at once suggests itself, “Was B bound to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge?” The answer to this is obvious. By hypothesis, B was not bound to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge…. If B was not bound to continue to cross the bridge, if B is will-free, why should not A also be will-free? Suppose that after B has crossed half the bridge he gets tired and tells A that he refuses to continue crossing. B, concededly, would be perfectly within his rights in so speaking and acting. A would have no cause of action against B for damages. If B has a <i>locus poenitentiae</i>, so has A…”.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

For present purposes it is enough to recall that Mrs Carlill never informed the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company that she was accepting their offer of the £100 reward. On appeal, counsel for the company took this point to argue that there had been no acceptance.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Rejecting the company&#8217;s submission that there had been no acceptance and therefore no contract, Bowen LJ stated the following: “Then it was said that there was no notification of acceptance of the contract [<i>sic</i>]. One cannot doubt that, as an ordinary rule of law, an acceptance of an offer made ought to be notified to the person who makes the offer, in order that the two minds may come together. Unless this is done, the two minds may be apart, and there is not that consensus which is necessary in English law – I say nothing about the laws of other countries – to make a contract. But there is this clear gloss to be made upon that doctrine, that as notification of acceptance is required for the benefit of the person who makes the offer, the person who makes the offer may dispense with notice to himself if he thinks it desirable to do so, and I suppose there can be no doubt that where a person in an offer made by him to another person, expressly or impliedly intimates a particular mode of acceptance as sufficient to make the bargain binding, it is only necessary for the other person to whom such offer is made to follow the indicated method of acceptance; and if the person making the offer, expressly or impliedly intimates in his offer that it will be sufficient to act on the proposal without communicating acceptance of it to himself, performance of the condition is a sufficient acceptance without notification”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">A minor point – there seems to be some tension here between Bowen LJ&#8217;s appeal to the need for consensus [ad idem], and his “gloss” upon it. The gloss is founded upon freedom of contract; the parties can agree what they want, and one for whom the law provides a protection (communication) can waive that benefit if he sees fit. No doubt this is fair and pragmatic, but it is difficult to reconcile with some of the more schematic judicial dicta in favour of consensus ad idem. Either that consensus exists, or it does not.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The nature of the typical offer of a unilateral contract (usually intended as an inducement, as discussed earlier) leads naturally to an inference that the offeror wants action in response to the offer rather than assent. In bilateral contracts this inference is not nearly so natural, but the facts of the case may nevertheless justify it. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The next case is a well-known authority showing that acceptance by conduct can occur in a bilateral contract.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In order to regularise the situation, the company sent Brogden a draft contract. Brogden filled in various gaps in the contract, added the name of an arbitrator, and returned the form (this was regarded as the making of a counter-offer). The company&#8217;s manager put the form in his desk. Coal was then ordered and supplied in accordance with the draft contract, until Brogden denied any obligation to make further supplies. The company sued for breach of contract. Held by the House of Lords that a valid contract had come into existence; Brogden&#8217;s counter-offer had been accepted by the conduct of the company in placing orders for coal on its terms.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Although the detail which is most commonly remembered from this case is the putting of the draft contract into the desk drawer, be very clear that this was not the acceptance of Brogden&#8217;s counter-offer. Lord Blackburn, in a passage quoted in most of the casebooks, makes clear that what is required is the doing of “an extraneous act which clenches the matter, and shews beyond all doubt that each side is bound…”. He adds, with reference to the draft document in this case that “if both parties have acted upon that draft and treated it as binding, they will be bound by it”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;There seem to be different strands within this reasoning. The first amounts to this; if the offeree&#8217;s response to the offer indicates his acceptance (in the sense that it is verifiable, certain and cannot be withdrawn), then it will stand as an acceptance in law provided the offeror can be deemed to have waived the requirement of communication. The second really consists in the notion that an incomplete negotiation can be overtaken by the parties&#8217; subsequent conduct in acting as if they had reached agreement.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The first of these analyses derogates from the communication rule where it is possible to do so without forfeiting certainty. The second derogates in the name of realism, and reflects the courts&#8217; unwillingness to undo bargains upon which the parties have acted.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As the next case shows, however, there are limits to the use of realism to “suppose” a contract between the parties.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The letter included a request that British Steel would begin to manufacture the components in the interim, which they did. The parties continued to negotiate, but failed to reach agreement on various matters including the question whose standard terms were to govern. British Steel eventually claimed that no contract had arisen, but that they were entitled to recover reasonable remuneration on a quantum meruit basis for the work which they had done. Cleveland argued that a contract had come into being, under which they counter-claimed damages for late delivery of the components (claimed to be greater than Cleveland&#8217;s expenses).

Robert Goff J went on to consider whether a unilateral contract had arisen between the parties. He said that it was analytically possible to find the request and conditional promise of payment, and that the mechanism would have the advantage of importing certain statutorily implied terms into the relationship between the parties. However, he concluded that the unilateral contract solution had to be rejected, since the vital issue of whose terms were to govern was wholly dependent on the stalled negotiations for the express bilateral contract which both parties had expected to govern their relationship.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Does this case in fact set a limit to what can be done by taking a “realistic” view of contract formation, or does it strike a blow for realism? Professor Atiyah takes the first view, and criticizes the Cleveland Bridge decision. However, the contrary view is also arguable. The fact is that parties who choose to act as if they had a contract, when in reality they are still negotiating, take a risk. There was no departure from realism in Robert Goff J&#8217;s careful attention to the reality of the negotiation between the parties. Instead he rejected the implication of contractual solutions which would have constituted legal fictions, and upheld a claim for expenditure above Cleveland&#8217;s considerably more remote claim for consequential loss. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In reply, his uncle wrote proposing that they split the difference ( a small amount), adding “If I hear no more about him, I consider the horse mine at £30 15s”. Vitally, John Felthouse did not reply, and no money was paid, but he did instruct an auctioneer employed by him to sell his farming stock at auction that the horse should be kept out of the sale, since it was already sold. In spite of this the horse was sold at auction to a third party. An action in the tort of conversion was brought against the auctioneer by John&#8217;s uncle, but failed. An acceptance by John of his uncle&#8217;s offer did not appear on the facts. No title to the horse had vested in the uncle, since no contract had been concluded between him and John.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Despite the fact that this case can be and often is presented as a matter of common law, it largely turns on a statutory provision. Applying the Statute of Frauds, the court held that there had been no compliance with the requirements of the Act; the alleged bargain between John and his uncle was not in writing, nor had there been payment of the purchase price or delivery of the property. Valid acceptance by conduct could have been found in John&#8217;s instruction to the auctioneer to keep the horse out of the sale, but this would not have satisfied the Act. In fact, the Statute of Frauds has since largely been repealed, and it can be convincingly argued that this case would now be decided differently. Does it therefore constitute authority for the principle for which it tends to be cited – that silence does not constitute acceptance?<br>&emsp;&emsp;Most commentators emphasise a single expression in the judgment of Willes J; “it is also clear that the uncle had no right to impose upon the nephew a sale of his horse …unless he chose to comply with the condition of writing to repudiate the offer”. Excepting this one remark, which in any event is not a fair reflection of what John&#8217;s uncle was trying to do, the case turns on the Statute of Frauds. The later appeal judgments in the Court of Exchequer Chamber uphold the first instance decision exclusively on an application of the Act, with no reference to the impermissibility of silence as acceptance.<br>&emsp;&emsp;However, the good sense of Willes J&#8217;s observation in general terms cannot be contested, since it amounts to a check upon the practice of “inertia selling” – providing goods to consumers and stipulating that if no action is taken to return them within a specified time, they will be deemed to be accepted so that the purchaser owes the price. Even so, the dictum is less apposite than it was in the mid nineteenth century. Regulations have been put in place by Parliament (replacing the <i>Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971</i>) to impose tight limitations on this practice, so that the common law need no longer concern itself to police the area. Every argument for regarding <i>Felthouse v Bindley</i> as a leading case on acceptance by silence suffers on a closer examination; later developments have deprived it of almost all its force.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Notwithstanding all of this, there is one very sound reason for upholding the rule thought to be established by <i>Felthouse v Bindley</i>. The offeree&#8217;s silence is almost always capable of more than one explanation (eg. forgetfulness). It is contrary to the relatively formal analysis of offer and acceptance preferred by English law to allow an inherently ambiguous type of conduct to lead to mutually binding legal obligations, because it flouts the principle of certainty. Therefore, judicial opinion is against allowing silence to constitute acceptance, though reference is often made to exceptional circumstances in which it may be possible.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Following the appointment of two arbitrators, nothing happened for five and a half years. At the end of that period, the shipowners argued (inter alia) that the arbitration agreement had been mutually abandoned by an agreement to be inferred from the parties&#8217; inactivity. The Court of Appeal held that the circumstances did not permit that inference to be made.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Robert Goff LJ explained his reasons for rejecting the shipowners&#8217; submission in the following terms: “We have here to consider an appeal from a decision that a binding agreement should be inferred from silence and inaction. Silence and inaction by both parties are apparently here considered to be capable of giving rise to an offer by one, and to an acceptance by the other communicated in response to that offer. This is most surprising. We have all been brought up to believe it axiomatic that acceptance of an offer cannot be inferred from silence, save in the most exceptional circumstances (as to which see, for example, G. H. <span class="bd">Treitel</span>, <i>The Law of Contract</i> (6<sup>th</sup> edn, p. 27). Yet it is here suggested that silence and inaction can give rise both to an offer and to an acceptance; and there do not appear to be any special circumstances, in the silent abandonment of this reference to arbitration, which could justify any departure from general principle. In the absence of special circumstances, silence and inaction by a party to a reference are, objectively considered, just as consistent with his having inadvertently forgotten about the matter; or with his simply hoping that the matter will die a natural death if he does not stir up the other party; or with his office staff, or his agents, or his insurers, or his solicitors, being appallingly slow”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Robert Goff LJ&#8217;s recital of potential causes of delay is persuasive, and skillfully crafted in order to persuade. However, his equally plausible reference to one party&#8217;s hoping that the matter “will die a natural death” rather begs the question. This is indeed what people do. Surely there comes a time when, as a result, the matter is dead. If that is the reality, the law is quite as much at fault if it cannot give it effect as it would be if it failed to take the measure of any other reality in the business world. Or is certainty a superior value, capable of trumping realism?</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The sellers made no response to this message. An arbitrator later held that the sellers&#8217; silence and failure to take further steps to perform the contract had amounted to an acceptance of the buyers&#8217; repudiation. This decision was upheld by the House of Lords.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord <span class="bd">Steyn</span> made the following comment on the inferences to be drawn from silence and inactivity: “Sometimes in the practical world of businessmen an omission to act may be as pregnant with meaning as a positive declaration. While the analogy of offer and acceptance is imperfect, it is not without significance that while the general principle is that there can be no acceptance of an offer by silence, our law does in exceptional cases recognize acceptance of an offer by silence. Thus in <i>Rust v Abbey Life Assurance Co Ltd</i> [1979] 2 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep 334 the Court of Appeal held that a failure by a proposed insured to reject a proffered insurance policy for seven months justified on its own an inference of acceptance. See also <span class="bd">Treitel</span> The Law of Contract (9<sup>th</sup> edn, 1995)…. Similarly, in the different field of repudiation, a failure to perform may sometimes be given a colour by special circumstances and may only be explicable to a reasonable person in the position of the repudiating party as an election to accept the repudiation”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The company argued that it had given consideration for this alleged agreement by agreeing to pay its debt to the Revenue in instalments. In the Court of Appeal Peter Gibson LJ held that this could not be regarded as consideration for the alleged promise, since the company was doing no more than it was already obliged to do. “The difficulty that I feel with [the argument that <i>Williams v Roffey</i> should apply] is that if the principle of <i>Williams</i>&#8216; case is to be extended to an obligation to make payment, it would in effect leave the principle in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> without any application. Where a creditor and a debtor who are at arm&#8217;s length reach agreement on the payment of the debt by instalments to accommodate the debtor, the creditor will no doubt always see a practical benefit to himself in so doing. In the absence of authority there would be much to be said for the enforceability of such a contract. But that was a matter expressly considered in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> yet held not to constitute good consideration in law. <i>Foakes v Beer</i> was not even referred to in <i>Williams&#8217;</i> case, and it is in my judgment impossible, consistently with the doctrine of precedent, for this court to extend the principle of <i>Williams</i>&#8216; case to any circumstances governed by the principle of <i>Foakes v Beer</i>.

As a result of organisational restructuring pending in response to the financial crisis of 2008, bank staff became disaffected, and measures were adopted to try to prevent their mass departure and the consequential collapse of the investment banking division. These included an announcement to staff that a bonus pool of 400 million euros had been created, and that whilst no individual guarantees were given the bonus pool would be distributed. The bank later sought to retreat from this position. The main questions of contract law arising in the subsequent dispute were whether the bank&#8217;s announcement was an offer made with the intention to create legal relations; and whether it was contractually binding in view of the fact that no acceptance of it had been sought or received from staff.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Held by the Court of Appeal that legal relations had been intended, and that the offer bound the bank despite the absence of acceptance.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;“Well established contract theory requires acceptance [...] and there was none here.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In my view there are at least two related answers to this submission. First, as Lord Justice Bowen observed in the Carbolic Smoke Ball case (supra, p. 269) “... as notification of acceptance is required for the benefit of the person who makes the offer, the person who makes the offer may dispense with notice to himself.” In that case the mode of acceptance was held by implication to be actually performing the conditions attached to the offer. Here, in my view, it is plain that the employer has dispensed with the need for any response to the offer at all. This was a promise without any disadvantage, actual or potential, of any kind to the employees. Nobody hearing the promise made in this announcement would for one moment expect the employee to be able to benefit from it only if he or she positively accepted the offer. It would be a wholly formal and unnecessary exercise; the only sensible implication is that all employees who might potentially benefit from the promise would be deemed to have accepted it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Second, the nature of the promise is inconsistent with the notion of individual acceptance. It would mean that if, say, a minority of the relevant staff accepted the offer, the employers would be bound to pay the whole of the bonus pool, if only to the minority”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The letter was carried by a waggoner employed by the offeree to carry flour. It included a postscript: “Please write by return of wagon whether you accept our offer”. The offeree instead posted a letter of acceptance to the offeror at Georgetown, which took longer to arrive than would a reply conveyed by wagon. The offeree failed in an action for damages in respect of the offeror&#8217;s refusal to accept the flour.

The first was that a valid acceptance would have had to be directed to the place to which the wagon was bound on its return journey, and not to Georgetown. The second was that the manner of communication of acceptance was unimportant. Any means would have sufficed, provided it was as quick (or quicker) as a reply by wagon.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This case is commented on by Winfield (“Some Aspects of Offer and Acceptance (1939) 55 LQR 516), and by Smith and Thomas. Winfield suggests that if the offeror had received a posted acceptance at the same time or earlier than he would have received a reply by return of wagon, he could not have denied its validity on the ground that he had required a reply to be carried by wagon. Smith and Thomas add that if he had made it clear that only a reply by wagon would do, then the position would be different; if the offeror chooses to place restrictions on what is to constitute a valid acceptance, they will be upheld. If one assumes these propositions to be correct, the situation seems to be this; the courts will analyse contract formation with the assumption that practicality and efficiency are the controlling values behind the mechanics envisaged by the offeror, but if the offeror makes it clear that only one form of communication will amount to a satisfactory response, freedom of contract demands that his stipulation be upheld.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Further values which condition legal analysis of contract formation are certainty (as we have already seen), common sense, and a judgment as to where the risks should lie.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The Court of Appeal therefore had to decide at what point the acceptance took effect. It held that acceptance occurred on receipt of the message in London, so that the contract had been made within the jurisdiction.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">Denning LJ</span> considered various hypothetical situations in which attempts to communicate acceptance might be disrupted. He laid down as a general rule that where the disruption is apparent to the maker of the acceptance, it will not be valid until it has been repeated. He went on: “In all the instances I have taken so far, the man who sends the message of acceptance knows that it has not been received or he has reason to know it. So he must repeat it. But, suppose that he does not know that his message did not get home. He thinks it has. This may happen if the listener on the telephone does not catch the words of acceptance, but nevertheless does not trouble to ask for them to be repeated: or the ink on the teleprinter fails at the receiving end, but the clerk does not ask for the message to be repeated: so that the man who sends an acceptance reasonably believes that his message has been received. The offeror in such cases is clearly bound, because he will be estopped from saying that he did not receive the message of acceptance. It is his own fault that he did not get it. But if there should be a case where the offeror without any fault on his part does not receive the message of acceptance – yet the sender of it reasonably believes it has got home when it has not – then I think there is no contract”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The reference here to estoppel requires explanation and a brief comment. Lord Denning, as you will come to see, was more closely associated with this rule than any other judge. Estoppel, at its inception, was a rule of evidence which prevented a party to litigation saying something in court which would admittedly be both relevant and true, but which it would be unfair to allow him to maintain since the parties conducted themselves on a different basis. In the passage above, Denning LJ is using it in a broad sense to indicate the unfairness of allowing the offeror to set up his own carelessness as a defence. Note the result; despite the fact that the offeror did not receive notice of the acceptance, he is to be treated as if he did. A commonsense account of what happened is here displaced by a legal fiction, in the name of fairness.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In the next case the court again departs from a purely factual analysis of communication in order to achieve fairness.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It was held to be the defendants&#8217; own fault that they had not seen the withdrawal at or shortly after the time it was sent, since they must either have left the office early or failed to pay attention to their telex machine.

The company secretary, by way of acceptance, made out a letter of allotment and posted it to the defendant in Swansea, but it never arrived. The company later went into liquidation, and the liquidator sued the defendant for the balance of the price of the shares. The Court of Appeal held that a contract had come into existence upon the posting of the share allotment, despite the fact that it never reached the defendant. Thesiger LJ suggested that this ruling would not cause great hardship, since the post generally did not fail, the offeror could choose to stipulate that acceptance would only bind him upon communication (ousting the postal rule), and if he did not hear from the offeree, he could make enquiries of him.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This, however, was too much for <span class="bd">Bramwell LJ</span>, who dissented: “If...posting a letter which does not reach is a sufficient communication of acceptance of an offer, it is equally a communication of everything else which may be communicated by post, for example, notice to quit. It is impossible to hold, if I offer my landlord to sell him some hay and he writes accepting my offer, and in the same letter gives me notice to quit, and posts his letter which, however, does not reach me, that he has communicated to me his acceptance of my offer, but not his notice to quit. Suppose a man has paid his tailor by cheque or banknote, and posts a letter containing a cheque or banknote to his tailor, which never reaches, is the tailor paid? If he is, would he be if he had never been paid before in that way? Suppose a man is in the habit of sending cheques and banknotes to his banker by post, and posts a letter containing cheques and banknotes, which never reaches. Is the banker liable? Would he be if this was the first instance of a remittance of this sort? In the cases I have supposed, the tailor and banker may have recognised this form of remittance by sending back receipts and putting the money to the credit of the remitter. Are they liable with that? Are they liable without it? The question then is, is posting a letter which is never received a communication to the person addressed, or an equivalent, or something which dispenses with it? It is for those who say it is to make good their contention. I ask why is it? My answer beforehand to any argument that may be urged is that it is not a communication, and that there is no agreement to take it as an equivalent for or to dispense with a communication. That those who affirm the contrary say the thing which is not. That if Brian C.J. had had to adjudicate on the case, he would deliver the same judgment as that reported. That because a man, who may send a communication by post or otherwise, sends it by post, he should bind the person addressed, although the communication never reaches him, while he would not so bind him if he had sent it by hand, is impossible. There is no reason in it; it is simply arbitrary. I ask whether anyone who thinks so is prepared to follow that opinion to its consequence....</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">If you wonder what lies behind Bramwell LJ&#8217;s obvious indignation, it is worth considering this passage from the judgment of Thesiger LJ (in the majority in the same case): “How then can a casualty in the post, whether resulting in delay, which in commercial transactions is often as bad as no delivery, or in non-delivery, unbind the parties or unmake the contract? To me it appears that in practice a contract complete upon the acceptance of an offer being posted, but liable to be put an end to by an accident in the post, would be more mischievous than a contract only binding upon the parties to it upon the acceptance actually reaching the offeree, and I can see no principle of law from which such an anomalous contract can be deduced”. Quite; but of course this eloquently shows why the simple solution would be to apply the ordinary rule that acceptance must be communicated, and abandon the postal rule.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Several of Bramwell LJ&#8217;s examples do not work, although only for a reason at which he would probably have scoffed; the operation of the postal rule is confined to acceptances of offers, and has no application to any other situation. That said, he was certainly right to remark that the rule is an arbitrary one. The cases that follow, however, tend to place conditions on its applicability. In the result, the rule may not be English contract law&#8217;s greatest ornament, but on the other hand it is difficult to envisage it causing very much harm.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The plaintiff applied for specific performance of the contract of sale; its refusal by the judge at first instance was overturned on appeal.

Lord Herschell stated a general test for the applicability of the postal rule: “Where the circumstances are such that it must have been within the contemplation of the parties that, according to the ordinary usages of mankind, the post might by used as a means of communicating the acceptance of an offer, the acceptance is complete as soon as it is posted”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;In <i>Henthorn v Fraser</i>, the defendants unsuccessfully argued that the postal rule should not apply on the facts of the case, because the offer letter had been handed to the plaintiff rather than posted.

By making it clear that the applicability of the rule does not turn exclusively on the means used to communicate the offer, the judgments allow the conclusion that by no means every posting of an offer will apply the rule to a posted reply.

It was refused at first instance and on appeal. On the true construction of the offer, nothing less than actual communication of acceptance would bind the defendants to a contract of sale.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The reason for the decision on appeal is given by Russell LJ: “In the present case, the parties here contemplated that the postal service might be used to communicate acceptance of the offer (by exercise of the option); and I agree with that. But that is not and cannot be the end of the matter. In any case, before one can find that the basic principle of the need for communication of acceptance to the offeror is displaced by this artificial concept of communication by the act of posting, it is necessary that the offer is in its terms consistent with such displacement and not one which by its terms points rather in the direction of actual communication….<br>&emsp;&emsp;The relevant language here is, “the said option shall be exercisable by notice in writing to the Intending Vendor…”, a very common phrase in an option agreement. There is, of course, nothing in that phrase to suggest that notification to the defendant could not be made by post. But the requirement of “notice…to”, in my judgment is language which should be taken expressly to assert the ordinary situation in law that acceptance requires to be communicated or notified to the offeror, and is inconsistent with the theory that acceptance can be constituted by the act of posting…”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In addition to establishing that the postal rule may be expressly (or impliedly) ousted by the language of the offer, <i>Holwell v Hughes</i> imposes a further limitation on its operation. The limitation is not uncontroversial, but in the following passage, Lawton LJ contrives to dovetail it quite neatly into Lord Herschell&#8217;s general test: “Does the [postal] rule apply in <i>all</i> cases where one party makes an offer which both he and the person with whom he was dealing must have expected the post to be used as a means of accepting it? In my judgment, it does not. First, it does not apply when the express terms of the offer specify that the acceptance must reach the offeror….Secondly, it probably does not operate if its application would produce manifest inconvenience and absurdity. This is the opinion set out in Cheshire and Fifoot&#8217;s <i>Law of Contract</i> (8<sup>th</sup> ed., 1972), p. 43. It was the opinion of <span class="bd">Bramwell</span> B as is seen by his judgment in <i>British &amp; American Telegraph Co v Colson</i> ((1871) LR 6 Exch 108), and his opinion is worthy of consideration even though the decision in that case was overruled by this court in <i>Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant</i>. The illustrations of inconvenience and absurdity which <span class="bd">Bramwell</span> B gave are as apt today as they were then…. In my judgment, the factors of inconvenience and absurdity are but illustrations of a wider principle, namely, that the rule does not apply if, having regard to the subject-matter under consideration, the negotiating parties cannot have intended that there should be a binding agreement until the party accepting an offer or exercising an option had in fact communicated the acceptance or exercise to the other”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is now established that the rule will not apply to a misaddressed letter of acceptance.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Toulson J, distinguishing <i>Adams v Lindsell</i> and <i>Henthorn v Fraser</i>, held that those cases did not govern the misdirection of a letter (or fax) of acceptance, and that the postal rule should not apply to a misdirected communication.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Since this judgment is recent, it is worth looking at it in some detail. It would also seem to be of importance in that it assumes that the postal rule can apply to faxes; this issue was previously thought to be unresolved.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">(11)</span> If the letter is wrongly addressed, very different considerations apply. Common sense dictates that it is unfair to the intended recipient that he should be bound by something which he is unlikely to receive because of the fault of the sender. Moreover, if he is to be so bound, such a rule would have the potential to give to the careless would-be acceptor an unfair advantage. Suppose that the would-be acceptor realises that the letter or fax has been sent to the wrong address or number. On the owners&#8217; argument, a contract would already have come into existence. In the practical world, the acceptor would then have an option whether to reveal the contract to the offeror, or to keep silent about it. If the market had moved, this could be a valuable option. The would-be acceptor, in that situation, would also have the opportunity to nurse his option by waiting to see how the market moved before deciding whether to reveal the existence of the contract. Even if the law crafted some form of rule of good faith to prohibit a party from acting in such a way, such a rule could in the nature of things be difficult to enforce. It is not hard to envisage circumstances in which only the would-be acceptor would know when he discovered the true position.<br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">(12)</span> Mr. Lewis submitted that in such situations there should be no firm rule of law, as in the ordinary posting rule, but that it should be for the court to decide on a case by case basis what result most fairly suited the facts. I do not accept that submission. Rules about offer and acceptance ought to be clear, so that parties may know where they stand. A situation in which it is unclear whether or not a contract has been formed until a court decides in the exercise of some form of general discretion whether or not a contract has been formed would be unsatisfactory.<br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">(15)</span> The topic of misdirected letters of acceptance has been considered by text book writers. Chitty, at paragraph 2-056, has the following passage:</p><p>@&#8220;Misdirected letter of acceptance. A letter of acceptance may be lost or delayed because it bears a wrong or an incomplete address, or because it is not properly stamped. Normally such defects would be due to the carelessness of the offeree, and although there is no English authority precisely on point, it is submitted that the postal rule should not apply to such cases. Although an offeror may have to take the risk of accidents in the post, it would be unreasonable to impose on him the further risk of the acceptor&#8217;s carelessness. These arguments do not apply where the misdirection is due to the fault of the offeror, e.g. where his own address is incompletely or illegibly given in the offer itself. In such a case, the offeror shall not be allowed to rely on the fact that the acceptance was misdirected, except perhaps where his error in stating his own address was obvious to the offeree, for in such a case the offeror&#8217;s fault would not be the effective cause of the misdirection of the acceptance. It is submitted that a misdirected acceptance should take effect, if at all, at the time which is least favourable to the party responsible for the misdirection.&#8221;<span class="it"><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">“I agree with that general approach, because it seems to me to correspond with principle and justice”.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It is interesting to see what appears to be express judicial approval for the last sentence of the passage above from Chitty on Contracts. The opinion expressed there is that of <span class="bd">Treitel</span>, previously editor of Chitty, and it went beyond the authorities until the Korbetis case. Is it really the business of the courts to decide the moment at which acceptance takes effect with a view to doing the maximum damage to the party responsible for misaddressing an envelope? The competing view, of course, would simply be that the misdirected acceptance is no longer covered by the postal rule, and therefore binds upon communication, provided the offer is still open for acceptance. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">On the ordinary rule, that acceptance must be communicated in order to become binding, a written acceptance could be countermanded before the moment of communication. Technically, an attempt to do so after communication could be treated as an anticipatory breach of contract. On the postal rule, there would seem to be no opportunity to countermand once the acceptance is committed to the post.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">However, it is also necessary to consider the fact of the matter. Since there clearly will be a period between the posting of acceptance and its communication to the offeror, there are bound to be situations in which the offeree would wish to countermand his acceptance during that period. What is more, it will often be a simple matter to accomplish it in factual terms, for example by a phone call pre-empting the letter&#8217;s delivery.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">There is no clear authority on whether the postal rule prevails in this situation or not. The issue is considered at greatest length by Treitel, who favours the application of the postal rule, although for reasons of policy rather than slavish adherence to logic. His concern is the same as that canvassed by Toulson J in the <i>Korbetis</i> case above. If it were possible for the offeree to write and post a letter of acceptance, and pending its arrival be free to countermand it by some speedier means of communication, the offeree would effectively be able to speculate at the offeror&#8217;s expense (see Treitel, para 2.036). One may doubt whether this concern is realistic, given that it is unlikely that the postal rule would apply in the first place in a market sufficiently volatile to make speculation possible. In addition, as Treitel fairly points out, where the first the offeror knows of the offeree&#8217;s response to his offer is that it is rejected, it would seem odd to insist that the earlier acceptance must prevail. To do so could well be an example of the “inconvenience and absurdity” which Lawton LJ recognised in <i>Holwell v Hughes</i>.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it"><span class="bd">Bramwell LJ</span>, dissenting in <i>Household Fire Insurance Co v Grant</i>, took a view on this problem: “It was said, if he send [the letter] by hand, it is revocable, but not if he sends it by post, which makes the difference. But it is revocable when sent by post, not that the letter can be got back, but its arrival might be anticipated by a letter by hand or telegram, and there is no case to show that such an anticipation would not prevent the letter from biding, It would be a most alarming thing to say that it would”.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In fact no formal contract was ever concluded. The plaintiff&#8217;s action for specific performance of the agreement failed. There was no contract to be enforced.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;“I am of the opinion that there is no contract. I take it the principle is clear. If in the case of a proposed sale or lease of an estate two persons agree to all the terms and say, “We will have the terms put into form,” then all the terms being put into writing and agreed to, there is a contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If two persons agree in writing that up to a certain point the terms shall be the terms of the contract, but that the minor terms shall be submitted to a solicitor, and shall be such as are approved of by him, then there is no contract, because all the terms have not been settled.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Now with regard to the construction of letters which are relied upon as constituting a contract, I have always thought that the authorities are too favourable to specific performance. When a man agrees to buy an estate, there are a great many more stipulations wanted than a mere agreement to buy the estate and the amount of purchase-money that is to be paid. What is called an open contract is clearly a most perilous thing, and even now, notwithstanding the provisions of a recent Act of Parliament – the Vendor and Purchaser Act 1874 – no prudent man who has an estate to sell would sign a contract of that kind, but would stipulate that certain conditions should be inserted for his protection. When, therefore, you see a stipulation as to a formal agreement put into a contract, you may say that it was not put in for nothing, but to protect the vendor against that very thing...”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Sir George Jessel&#8217;s reference to an open contract (a contract which gives the names of the parties, the property to be sold and the agreed price) is an apt starting point for an examination of this decision. Here is a reminder that such a contract is possible, and so it should be, on ordinary principles of offer and acceptance. However, it is viewed as unlikely to have been intended to bind the parties (see also <i>Harvey v Facey</i>, and <i>Clifton v Palumbo</i>). The reference to the parties&#8217; intention seems to ground this attitude of the courts in the principle of freedom of contract, but that may cloak something like its opposite – paternalism.<br>&emsp;&emsp;To the critical eye, even the principle described by the Master of the Rolls as “clear” is far from self-evident. As a matter of standard contract formation, parties who agree all terms are bound whether or not they choose to have the detail of their agreement formally drafted. And parties who agree the majority of the terms themselves, but then appoint a solicitor to settle minor matters, surely are bound; the arrangement does not presume further negotiation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;What can one take from this case, and from the two authorities mentioned above? It has to be realised that a general account of the rules of contract formation must take into account <i>context.</i> Dealings in land, particularly, bring into play not only rules, but a willingness on the part of the courts to supply an attitude of caution that the parties themselves may not in fact have shown.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The phrase is a perfectly familiar one in the mouths of estate agents and other persons accustomed to deal with land; and I can quite understand a solicitor saying to a client about to negotiate for the sale of his land: “Be sure that to protect yourself you introduce into any preliminary contract you may think of making the words “subject to contract”.” I do not say that the phrase makes the contract containing it necessarily and whatever the context a conditional contract. But they are words appropriate for introducing a condition, and it would require a very strong and exceptional case for this clear prima facie meaning to be displaced”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Although the meaning of “subject to contract” is generally understood, and therefore unlikely to do much harm of an obvious sort, it is strange that what may look very like a contract can be prevented from binding by being made subject to the conclusion of a further contract. There are good reasons for the law to allow a device of this kind; like the use of the words “without prejudice”, it enables a party to communicate constructively in circumstances where the risk of being bound by one&#8217;s words might otherwise make negotiation difficult. However, the device does not fit entirely happily within the mechanics of contract formation set out so far. An agreement, although “subject to contract” is no less of an agreement for the insertion of these words. Yet it can be disregarded by one of the parties to it in a way which may leave the other with a very natural sense of grievance and no remedy. Furthermore, the task of making the real agreement – the one which will bind the parties – will be taken over by lawyers. A failure on their part to agree will be quite capable of leaving the parties to the original negotiation (who did agree) with nothing from it. All this in order to protect them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;An agreement expressly described as “provisional” pending the drawing up of a more formalised contract may nevertheless be binding.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He contacted the plaintiff, a property developer and builder. The proposal was that the developer should introduce a financial backer, and himself carry out the construction work. After a meeting between the two, the developer wrote to the owner proposing that if he could make a suitable financial arrangement, the owner “will be prepared to instruct your Quantity Surveyor to negotiate fair and reasonable contract sums in respect of each of the three projects as they arise. (These would, incidentally be based upon agreed estimates of the net cost of work and general overheads with a margin for profit of 5%) which, I am sure you will agree, is indeed reasonable”. The owner agreed. Financial backing was found by the developer, but the parties were not able to agree on the pricing of the project. The owner then employed another developer, using the finance found by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued for the profit he would have made on the project, succeeded at first instance, and lost on appeal. The agreement contained in the correspondence was no more than an agreement to negotiate, which was not a contract known to the law.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The judgment of Lord <span class="bd">Denning MR</span> in this case contains a valuable insight into the normal methods for fixing the price in building contracts, and significant statements of principle as well. Therefore a substantial extract is given from it here:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“I am afraid that I have come to a different view from the judge. The reason is because I can find no agreement on the price or on any method by which the price was to be calculated. The agreement was only an agreement to “negotiate” fair and reasonable contract sums. The words of the letter are “your Quantity Surveyor to negotiate fair and reasonable contract sums in respect of each of the three projects as they arise”. Then there are words which show that estimates had not yet been agreed, but were yet to be agreed. The words are “These [the contract sums] would, incidentally be based upon agreed estimates of the net cost of work and general overheads with a margin for profit of 5%”. Those words show that there were no estimates agreed and no contract sums agreed. All was left to be agreed in the future. It was to be agreed between the parties themselves. If they had left the price to be agreed by a third person such as an arbitrator, it would have been different. But here it was to be agreed between the parties themselves.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Now the price in a building contract is of fundamental importance. It is so essential a term that there is no contract unless the price is agreed or there is an agreed method of ascertaining it, not dependent on the negotiations of the two parties themselves. In a building contract both parties must know at the outset, before the work is started, what the price is to be, or, at all events, what agreed estimates are. No builder and no employer would ever dream of entering into a building contract for over £200,000 without there being an estimate of the cost and an agreed means of ascertaining the price.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the ordinary course of things the architects and the quantity surveyors get out the specification and the bills of quantities. They are submitted to the contractors. They work out the figures and tender for the work at a named price; and there is a specified means of altering it up or down for extras or omissions and so forth, usually by means of an architect&#8217;s certificate. In the absence of some such machinery, the only contract which you might find is a contract to do the work for a reasonable sum or for a sum to be fixed by a third party. But here there is no such contract at all. There is no machinery for ascertaining the price except by negotiation. In other words, the price is still to be agreed. Seeing that there is no agreement on so fundamental a matter as the price, there is no contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;But then this point was raised. Even if there was not a contract actually to build, was not there a contract to negotiate? In this case Mr Tolaini did instruct his quantity surveyor to negotiate, but the negotiations broke down. It may be suggested that the quantity surveyor was to blame for the failure of the negotiations. But does that give rise to a cause of action? There is very little guidance in the books about a contract to negotiate. It was touched on by Lord Wright in <i>Hillas &amp; Co Ltd v Arcos</i> [see further below] where he said: “There is then no bargain except to negotiate, and negotiations may be fruitless and end without any contract ensuing”. Then he went on:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“...yet even then, in strict theory, there is a contract (if there is good consideration) to negotiate, though in the event of repudiation by one party the damages may be nominal, unless a jury think that the opportunity to negotiate was of some appreciable value to the injured party”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;That tentative opinion by Lord Wright does not seem to me to be well founded. If the law does not recognise a contract to enter a contract (when there is a fundamental term yet to be agreed) it seems to me it cannot recognise a contract to negotiate. The reason is because it is too uncertain to have any binding force. No court could estimate the damages because no one can tell whether the negotiations would be successful or would fall through; or if successful, what the result would be. It seems to me that a contract to negotiate, like a contract to enter into a contract, is not a contract known to the law.... I think we must apply the general principle that when there is a fundamental matter left undecided and to be the subject of negotiation, there is no contract. So I would hold that there was not any enforceable agreement in the letters between the plaintiff and the defendants. I would allow the appeal accordingly”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">There are several strands of reasoning in this passage. All deserve comment. The first, based on construction of the correspondence between the parties, amounts to the observation that they have not reached agreement on price. Correct, but they have agreed the means by which they will later do so, the way in which the total price itself will be fixed, and the principles (fairness and reasonableness) which will govern the settlement of differences. The fact that the negotiations later broke down is nothing to the point, since the existence of a contract is not, at least in theory, affected by what happens further down the line. However, according to Lord Denning&#8217;s (wholly uncontroversial) analysis, it is as if nothing had been agreed at all. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Lord Denning&#8217;s helpful resume of common practice in the pricing of building contracts again shows the importance of context in assessing cases of this type. In a case of the sale of goods, a different context, the law&#8217;s approach is wholly dissimilar. Here, by virtue of the Sale of Goods Act, silence as to the price of goods triggers the Act&#8217;s importation of a “reasonable” price into the deal, so that the contract will be upheld. Plausible resolution of cases where agreement is incomplete depends on the type of commerce in question.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Finally, Lord Denning states that the law will not recognise a contract to make a contract or a contract to negotiate. This is stated as a matter of principle, but it is better understood as one of practicality. The real reason for it is that the evidence in a case of serious incompleteness may well not be adequate to establish a given quantum of loss, or perhaps even a breach. The pressure to elevate this perception into a principle probably derives from the courts&#8217; general unwillingness to trespass upon what they see as the sole preserve of the parties themselves – the making of bargains. Agreement is sacrosanct and the courts, which assert no power to impose it or even to supervise it, will not readily assume that it lies within the parties&#8217; reach.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It is somewhat surprising that apparently absolute propositions (there can be no enforceable agreement to negotiate) can co-exist in judgments with detailed attention to context and business practice. However, not only does such an absolute proposition survive the next case; it is elaborated by it.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

An agreement for sale was concluded between them, subject to contract. Miles then further agreed with Walford that if the latter&#8217;s bankers would provide a comfort letter confirming the financing of the deal, Miles would cease negotiations with any other party with a view to concluding a formal contract with Walford. Walford did as agreed, but Miles sold the business to the party with whom he had originally been negotiating. Walford sued for the amount by which he said the true value of the business exceeded the price he had agreed for it. He argued that a term was to be implied into the further agreement, to give it business efficacy, that Miles would continue to negotiate with him in good faith.

He gave as his reason for rejecting it the fact of its inherent uncertainty, but in the following passage, there appears to be a further ground for his decision:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“How can a court be expected to decide whether, <i>subjectively</i>, a proper reason existed for the termination of negotiations? The answer suggested depends upon whether the negotiations have been determined “in good faith”. However, the concept of a duty to carry on negotiations in good faith is inherently repugnant to the adversarial position of the parties when involved in negotiations. Each party to the negotiations is entitled to pursue his (or her) own interest, so long as he avoids making misrepresentations. To advance that interest he must be entitled, if he thinks it appropriate, to threaten to withdraw from further negotiations or to withdraw in fact, in the hope that the opposite party may seek to reopen the negotiations by offering him improved terms. Mr Naughton, of course, accepts that the agreement upon which he relies does not contain a duty to complete the negotiations. But that still leaves the vital question – how is a vendor ever to know that he is entitled to withdraw from further negotiations? How is the court to police such an “agreement”? A duty to negotiate in good faith is as unworkable in practice as it is inherently inconsistent with the position of a negotiating party. It is here that the uncertainty lies. In my judgment, while negotiations are in existence either party is entitled to withdraw from those negotiations, at any time and for any reason. There can thus be no obligation to continue to negotiate until there is a “proper reason” to withdraw. Accordingly a bare agreement to negotiate has no legal content”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Walford v Miles</i> is regarded as singularly important because it all but closes the door on any move to establish a general duty of good faith in English contract law. Uncertainty is the reason for the rejection of the duty as it would have applied in this case, backed up by the notion that good faith is “inherently repugnant to” the adversarial position of the parties to contractual negotiation. To put aside for the moment the fact that negotiations vary, and in many there will be far more shared interests than differences, here perhaps Lord Ackner gives the nub of the law&#8217;s difficulty conceiving of a valid agreement to agree or to negotiate. The parties are seen as occupying fundamentally opposing positions. When this perception breaks through an analysis of how closely the parties have approached the creation of legal obligations based on consensus, it will almost inevitably do so to lessen the likelihood of an enforceable agreement being found. It is noteworthy that a view of negotiation which holds good only for a certain type of hard bargaining nevertheless determines the law&#8217;s approach to all agreements to try to reach agreement.<br>&emsp;&emsp;At the same time, Lord Ackner draws a distinction between such an agreement, and an agreement to use best endeavours. The latter is not uncertain, and therefore binds. But this distinction is difficult to accept. Most people surely would know a lack of good faith when they encountered it. By contrast, a failure to use best endeavours could almost always be seen in more than one light. To conclude, Lord Ackner&#8217;s position is best explained as a cultural scepticism with regard to the chances of future agreement. As such, it accords closely with the attitude of a lawyer raised in adversarial courtrooms, but is perhaps less consistent with the customs of the business world.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the short space of time since <i>Walford v Miles</i> there has been some movement, however. In 1997, the reasoning of Lord Ackner was doubted by Lord <span class="bd">Steyn</span> writing extra-judically (“Contract Law: Fulfilling the Reasonable Expectations of Honest Men”) 113 LQR 433. In 2005, the Court of Appeal upheld an <i>express</i> agreement to negotiate in good faith: see <i>Petromec. Inc. v Petroleo Brasileiro SA Petrobas (No 3)</i> [2005] EWCA Civ 891. The duty of good faith proposed in <i>Walford v Miles</i> was not express, but had been sought to be introduced as an implied term.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Walford v Miles is not an easy case, as you will probably agree after reading the discussion above. Two further comments may possibly help.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The difficulty in coming to terms with Lord Ackner&#8217;s reasoning is compounded by the way he glides between objections to the plaintiff&#8217;s case. With respect, his speech is by no means a masterpiece of legal reasoning.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">As <span class="bd">McKendrick</span> and others point out, the plaintiff&#8217;s case was quite likely to fail for a very basic reason. Walford had chosen to sue not for his reliance loss (a modest sum), but for his expectation loss. That was the difference between the agreed sale price, and what he said was the true value of the business – one million pounds. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Where an agreement has been performed, the attitude of the law is quite different.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They wrote to the plaintiffs as follows: “We ... undertake to cover you with an agreed commission on any other business transacted with your friends. In return for this you are to put us in direct contact with your friends”. The plaintiffs did put them in contact with the firm and Novinex went on to transact further business with it, but refused to pay any commission to the plaintiffs, who sued for breach of contract. Novinex successfully argued at first instance that it had not concluded a contract with the plaintiff. The contrary view prevailed on appeal. There was a difference between the analysis of agreements which were wholly executory (falling to be performed in the future) and those which had been executed (performed).</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Cohen LJ approved the law as stated by the trial judge (<span class="bd">Denning J</span>), but differed from him in applying it:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Is this an enforceable agreement? A number of authorities have been cited to us, to which I do not propose to refer in detail, because, in my view, the effect of the authorities is stated correctly in the learned judge&#8217;s judgment where he said “The principle to be deduced from the cases is that if there is an essential term which has yet to be agreed and there is no express or implied provision for its solution, the result in point of law is that there is no binding contract. In seeing whether there is an implied provision for its solution, however, there is a difference between an arrangement which is wholly executory on both sides and one which has been executed on one side or the other. In the ordinary way, if there is an arrangement to supply goods at a price “to be agreed” or to perform services on terms “to be agreed”, then although, while the matter is still executory, there may be no binding contract, nevertheless, if it is executed on one side, that is, if the one does his part without having come to an agreement as to the price or the terms, then the law will say that there is necessarily to be implied, from the conduct of the parties, a contract that, in default of agreement, a reasonable sum is to be paid”. With that statement of the principle of law, I respectfully agree. My difference with the learned judge is only on the question whether he has correctly applied that statement of principle to the facts of this case.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Then the judge continued on what, I think, is the principal issue: “And what is the amount of commission to be? If there is no usual or customary commission, how can anyone say what is a reasonable commission for a follow-up transaction or a repeat transaction...?” But the agreement had said in terms, instead of by implication: “we also undertake to cover you with a reasonable commission on any other business transacted with your friends”. Denning J seems to have regarded that condition as being too vague to be enforceable. I cannot agree with this view. I think that a court should take the view that a jury properly directed would be able to arrive at a proper conclusion as to what in the circumstances of this case is a reasonable commission”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;At a first glance it may seem remarkable that so much should hang on whether the contract has been performed or not. After all, it remains the same contract. The question as to its completeness remains in the first place a question of construction, and then of how far a judge is willing to go outside the contract to resolve the questions raised by it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A careful reading of the passage from Denning J&#8217;s first instance judgment quoted by Cohen LJ above will show that a different analysis takes over once the parties have acted upon their agreement. Performance does not magically clarify the contract or supply what is missing from it. Instead, an independent agreement arises from the fact of performance; “the law will say that there is necessarily implied from the conduct of the parties a contract that, in default of agreement, a reasonable sum is to be paid”. This is not the original contract, remedied by the fact of performance, but a new contract carrying within it reference to reasonableness as a measure for resolving the lacuna in the express agreement. As for the “necessity” of this implication, its basis is obvious. The alternative to imposing this solution is that one party will have been unjustly enriched at the expense of the other. It is therefore justice that demands this greater readiness to intervene.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">You may have noticed that the final sentence of Cohen LJ&#8217;s judgment is the second time in this lecture that reference has been made to what a jury could find (the first was the short quotation from Lord Wright&#8217;s speech in Hillas v Arcos, disapproved by Lord Denning MR in Courtney &amp; Fairbairn v Tolaini). The point is a minor one, but it may be worth remembering that there was a time when judges could still leave matters of fact to a jury for decision in contract cases. There must be a distinction of breadth between the range of issues capable of resolution by a jury in privacy, and those which can be resolved by a judge who must give reasons for the decision, and is subject to appeal. References to the broad ability of the jury to decide can be a way of keeping a matter nominally within the jurisdiction of the court even as the mechanism for deciding it remains vague.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The rule that an executory contract will less readily be patched up by the courts than a partly or wholly executed one needs to be carefully understood, because in the next case it appears to have been misapplied in the Court of Appeal.

The price was to be agreed upon by two valuers, one appointed by the lessor and the other by the lessees, or if they failed to agree, by an “umpire” to be appointed by the valuers. The lessors declined to appoint a valuer, and submitted that the agreement was void for uncertainty since it did not specify a price. The House of Lords, by a majority, rejected the contention that this was no more than an agreement to agree. The machinery devised by the parties for ascertaining price, even though it had broken down, indicated that a fair price was intended to be fixed. The court itself could decide a fair price on the evidence.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The inference that the price was to be a fair one arose from the nature of the machinery envisaged by the agreement. “Valuers”, in a generic sense, were to be appointed, and this suggested that the parties had meant to deal at a fair valuation. According to Lord Fraser, the position might have been different if a named valuer had been intended to act, or if the price had been intended to be fixed by an individual with special knowledge. Here, however, the process of valuation was subsidiary to the main purpose of the agreement, so that the court could vary it in order to uphold the agreement<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Fraser&#8217;s assumption that the parties intended to deal at a fair value is buttressed by the perspective of the law in various areas of contract. Thus, terms may be implied by a court into a contract on the ground of “business efficacy”, which has as its rationale the presumption that the parties as reasonable people in business would have intended their agreement to work rather than fail. Similarly, the very measure by which courts assess the parties&#8217; intentions and behaviour makes reference to reasonableness, and basically imputes it to the parties. Lord Russell, however, in a dissenting speech, made a broadside attack on the assumption that the parties to a contract mean to be fair and reasonable:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“My Lords, it appears to be generally accepted that the law as previously understood since at least the early nineteenth century is in favour of the respondents (the lessors) and of the decision of the Court of Appeal. It is proposed by a majority of your Lordships to assert that the previous understanding was erroneous. I cannot agree.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Basically the assumption is made that the parties intended that the exercise of the option should involve payment of a “fair price” or a “fair value”. Of course parties to such a contract could in terms so agree, and I am not concerned to deny that in such a case the court could enforce the contract by ascertainment of a fair price or fair value, treating specific provisions in the contract for methods (which proved to be unworkable) of ascertaining that fair price or valuation as being inessential. But that is not this case. Why should it be thought that potential vendor and purchaser intended the price to be “fair”? The former would intend the price to be high, even though “unfairly” so. And the latter vice versa. Vendors and purchasers are normally greedy”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;There may well be no way of reconciling the perspectives of Lord Fraser and Lord Russell. Perhaps the lesson to be learned from their difference is this. Whether one imputes fairness or unfairness to contracting parties, one is dealing in presumptions in default of evidence. However familiar and plausible the presumption applied by the majority in <i>Sudbrook</i>, it is not very strongly founded upon facts, and therefore it is easily shaken. It does not seem entirely far-fetched to suggest that the dominant policy of the law – to uphold bargains – is stalked by a more cynical awareness of what a bargain often is in fact; a good bargain for one because it is a bad bargain for the other. To put it in less colourful terms, a relational approach to contracting which attributes value to the parties being (and staying) in business together may be at odds with belief in freedom of contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Whether that is right or not, it is a fact that <i>Sudbrook v Eggleton</i> has been more often distinguished than applied. Given the later caselaw, which creates some fine distinctions, the problem addressed by <i>Sudbrook v Eggleton</i> should be regarded as one of considerable difficulty.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The subject of the following, which you may well wish to skip, is Lord <span class="bd">Diplock</span>&#8216;s explanation of why the agreement in Sudbrook v Eggleton was not merely an agreement to make an agreement. It is a good example of the way in which Lord <span class="bd">Diplock</span>&#8216;s technical contract analyses sometimes generate consequentialist solutions to problems which other judges are content to treat in broader terms:</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">“The option clause cannot be classified as a mere “agreement to make an agreement”. There are not any terms left to be agreed between the parties. In modern terminology, it is to be classified as a unilateral or “if” contract. Although it creates from the outset a right on the part of the lessees, which they will be entitled, but not bound, to exercise against the lessors at a future date, it does not give rise to any legal obligations on the part of either party unless and until the lessees give notice in writing to the lessors, within the stipulated period, of their desire to purchase the freehold reversion to the lease. The giving of such notice, however, converts the “if” contract into a synallagmatic or bilateral contract, which creates mutual legal rights and obligations on the part of both lessors and lessees.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The first obligation on each of them, once the contract has become synallagmatic, is to appoint their respective valuers to fix what is the fair and reasonable price for the reversion.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The obligation of both lessors and lessees on appointing their respective valuers is to instruct them to carry out the functions for which the option clause requires that they should be appointed, viz. to try to reach agreement with one another on a price for the reversion that is fair and reasonable as between the lessors and the lessees and, failing such agreement, to agree on and appoint a suitably qualified impartial person to fix such price.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">So, if both lessors and lessees carry out their primary contractual obligations to one another, under the option clause, the result will be a conveyance by the lessors to the lessees of the reversion in fee simple…at a price to be agreed on between valuers appointed by each party or failing such agreement determined by an umpire appointed jointly by the valuers. Until such conveyance and payment the contract remains executory; but so does any other contract for the sale of land. What Templeman LJ [in the Court of Appeal in this case] refers to in his summary of the effect of the authorities as the one central proposition from which all three principles that he states all stem, viz. until the price has been fixed by the method provided for in the contract “there is no complete agreement to enforce”…involves a fundamental fallacy”. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The fact that a contract had been acted upon, in combination with the presence of machinery within the contract for resolving differences (an arbitration clause), enabled the Court of Appeal to uphold an agreement in the next case:</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The agreement provided that the petrol was to be supplied “at a price to be agreed by the parties in writing and from time to time”, and included an arbitration clause relating to “any dispute or difference”. The land was conveyed, and petrol supplied for three years before the defendants repudiated the supply contract, asserting (inter alia) that it was not binding because it depended upon future agreement. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument. Scrutton LJ explained the grounds for the decision by reference to the arbitration clause, which in his view applied to any failure to agree the price for the petrol supply, and by reference to the fact that “the parties obviously believed they had a contract and they acted for three years as if they had”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This is a broad and liberal decision. To gauge the judicial state of mind which led to it, it is worth noticing that Scrutton LJ had dissented when the problem case of <i>May &amp; Butcher v The King</i> (see below) had reached the Court of Appeal five years previously. He commented on what lay behind his dissent in that case when again differing from the majority in <i>Hillas v Arcos</i> (see below):<br>&emsp;&emsp;“I am afraid I remain quite impenitent. I think it was right and that nine out of ten business men would agree with me. But of course I recognise that as a judge I am bound to follow the principles laid down by the House of Lords. But I regret that in many commercial matters the English law and the practice of commercial men are getting wider apart, with the result that commercial business is leaving the courts and is being decided by commercial arbitrators with infrequent reference to the courts….The commercial man does not think there can be no contract to make a contract when every day he finds a policy “premium to be agreed” treated by the law as a contract”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The seller failed to deliver the goods, and defended the buyers&#8217; claim for damages by arguing that because the words quoted above were unclear (there were no usual conditions of acceptance), so the contract was void for uncertainty. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, drawing a distinction between a clause, such as this, which was meaningless and could be severed from the contract, and a clause which required further agreement between the parties in order to be resolved.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">Denning LJ</span> explained his view of the situation as follows: “In the present case there was nothing yet to be agreed. There was nothing left to further negotiation. All that happened was that the parties agreed that “the usual conditions of acceptance apply”. That clause was so vague and uncertain as to be incapable of any precise meaning. It is clearly severable from the rest of the contract. It can be rejected without impairing the sense or reasonableness of the contract as a whole, and it should be so rejected. The contract should be held good and the clause ignored. The parties themselves treated the contract as subsisting. They regarded it as creating binding obligations between them; and it would be most unfortunate if the law should say otherwise.

If the effect of permitting an uncertainty to defeat a contract would be to allow a general way out of contracts, then the problem posed by such uncertainties is highly likely to be overcome by some means. Denning LJ&#8217;s task in this case was somewhat the easier because the context of the reference to the “usual conditions of acceptance” made it clear that some kind of exempting clause in favour of the seller was meant. Traditionally, courts have used interpretive flexibility to construe exempting clauses against those who insert them into contracts. The disposal of this case demonstrates a comparable policy.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They then attempted to formalise their agreement through correspondence, in the course of which Scammell (who had the balance to pay on the Commer van) wrote that “this order is given on the understanding that the balance of the purchase price can be had on hire-purchase terms over a period of 2 years”. The agreement went unperformed because of an argument about the condition of the Bedford van, and Scammell sued for breach of it. The House of Lords held, overturning the Court of Appeal, that there was no contract. The words quoted above were fundamentally problematic when found in what appeared to be a contract of sale, and admitted of so many mutually exclusive interpretations that they could not safely be given any one meaning.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion </span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The way in which this conclusion is reached is instructive. The fundamental problem in deducing agreement from informal correspondence, according to Viscount Maugham, is that “laymen unassisted by persons with a legal training are not always accustomed to use words or phrases with a precise or definite meaning”. He goes on to observe the range of interpretations which were put upon the agreement by the judges in the courts below, and deduces from that the impossibility of concluding that a binding agreement has been established. Lord Russell sums up the same conclusion: “An alleged contract which appeals for its meaning to so many skilled minds in so many different ways is undoubtedly open to suspicion. For myself I feel no doubt that no contract between the parties existed at all; notwithstanding that they may have thought otherwise”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The proper conclusion is therefore that the parties had failed to agree, and the circumstances of the deal were not such as to enable the court to make inferences from trade practice to salvage it. However, it is worth noticing, as an indication of another judicial attitude of mind which surfaces here and can therefore surface again in the future, how the problem presents itself to the House of Lords. The parties, as laymen, had not expressed themselves with precision. The skilled minds of those with a legal training were able between them to find so many accounts of what the parties might have meant that they ended up obliged to conclude that they could not have agreed.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Cases of serious uncertainty must occur, but the treatment of this case by Viscount Maugham alerts one to a risk not unlike the mischief scotched by Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> in <i>Nicolene v Simmonds</i>. One cannot have a contract defeated by the ingenuity of a would-be defaulter in finding meaningless detail within it. Nor should a contract be defeated by the subtlety of lawyers, if it might have been upheld on a slightly less sophisticated view.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is now time to turn to the two early twentieth century House of Lords cases, separated by only a few years but rather further apart in their ethos.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-132'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Incomplete and Vague Agreements - vague Agreements - Uncertainties Incapable of Resolution</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Hillas, a timber merchant, concluded an agreement with Arcos, a business representative of the Russian government, for the purchase of “22,000 standards of software goods of fair specification over the season 1930”, the buyers to arrange shipping dates. This transaction was effected without any difficulty. Clause 9 of the same agreement gave Hillas an option to enter into a contract for the purchase of “100,000 standards for delivery in 1931”. The price was to constitute a 5% discount from the officially listed price. When Hillas attempted to exercise this option, he discovered that Arcos had already sold its entire production. He sued for breach of contract. With a degree of hesitancy, the House of Lords held that the agreement did amount to a contract. The words “softwood goods of fair specification” had to be imported into the option clause as a necessary implication. The expression was not incapable of being given a meaning. The parties had considered that they had a contract, and had already acted on it. It was not for the court to be astute in finding defects in it which would destroy it.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;One key to an understanding of this case is to concentrate on what their Lordships took the expression “fair specification” to mean, and what turned upon its interpretation. Two possibilities were canvassed. It might mean “just, as a balance of the two parties&#8217; interests”, or it might mean “representative of what was on offer”. This is explained by Lord Thankerton: “Does the phrase mean a specification which is fair as between the interests, on the one hand, of the seller in respect of the stock of wood, comprising various kinds of wood and various qualities and sizes, available for sale in the season of 1931, and, on the other hand, the interests of the buyer in respect of the requirements of his trade during that season? Or does the phrase mean a fair selection from the seller&#8217;s stock of wood available for sale in that season? If the former construction be the proper one, I would be of opinion that the Court would not be entitled to adjudicate between the opposing interests of the two parties. If the latter construction be the proper one, the ascertainment of a fair selection from the seller&#8217;s available stock is within the province of the Court; in that the Court is applying a standard which is provided by the contract, and is thereby merely identifying the subject-matter of the contract”. Lord Thankerton held, despite “considerable doubt”, that the second construction was the correct one.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;So what does turn on this? If the reference to fairness was to what was equitable, then it was for the parties further to agree it, for the court could not agree for them. If “fair” had the sense of “representative”, however, the Court could (if it had come to it) have examined the evidence to see if the timber provided was or was not representative of the seller&#8217;s stocks in 1931. There would not be any agreement lacking at the stage of contract formation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Bearing this in mind, it may be somewhat easier to understand an otherwise very difficult sentence in the speech of Lord Tomlin. He has just set out the second of the available understandings of what fairness means in this context, stating that he considers it to be the correct interpretation, and then he says: “That is something which if the parties fail to agree can be ascertained just as much as the fair value of a property”. This is not an assertion that the parties&#8217; failure to agree can be patched up by a court. It refers to a later disagreement, occurring during the performance of the contract, as to whether one side&#8217;s performance is adequate or alternatively amounts to a breach. This, the court can investigate and decide, just as the court can decide on evidence what a house is worth. What a court cannot do – and <i>Hillas v Arcos</i> does not suggest otherwise – is to decide the price of a house when that issue was at large in negotiations and was not resolved by the parties.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It would be wrong to leave <i>Hillas v Arcos</i> without noting the broader propositions which the case contains. They are most clearly expressed in the speech of Lord Wright, but a paraphrase will get his meaning across briefly. The agreement between the parties was not well expressed, but they thought they had a contract and acted on it. Businessmen often record even the most important agreements in crude and summary form, particularly where they are in the same trade; they know what they mean, and it is the duty of a court to try to uphold their agreements.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The agreement arose from a letter containing these clauses:<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1) The Commission agrees to sell and [the suppliants] agree to purchase the total stock of old tentage….<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) The price or prices to be paid, and the date or dates on which payment is to be made by the purchasers to the Commission for such old tentage shall be agreed upon from time to time between the Commission and the purchasers as the quantities of the said old tentage become available for disposal, and are offered to the purchasers by the Commission….<br>&emsp;&emsp;(10) It is understood that all disputes with reference to or arising out of this agreement will be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration Act 1889.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The suppliants&#8217; claim for damages, an account and an injunction was refused by the House of Lords. The agreement between the parties was incapable of enforcement because it provided that price was to be agreed, and the parties&#8217; attempts to agree prices had in fact failed. In the face of that the court was not free to infer that the tentage was to be sold at a reasonable price. The arbitration clause applied to disputes arising out of the arrangement between the parties. The present problem, however, was a failure to agree, which Viscount Dunedin described as “a very different thing from a dispute”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;In <i>Fletcher Challenge Energy Ltd v Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Ltd</i> [2002] 2 NZLR 433, Blanchard J had the following to say about <i>May &amp; Butcher</i>:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Something should be said about the place that the controversial decision of the House of Lords in <i>May and Butcher Ltd v The King</i>[1934] 2 KB 17n has in the modern law of contract. We take the view that this case is no longer to be regarded as authority for any wider proposition than that an &#8220;agreement&#8221; which omits an essential term (or, as Lord Buckmaster called it, &#8220;a critical part&#8221;), or a means of determining such a term, does not amount to a contract. No longer should it be said, on the basis of that case, that <i>prima facie</i>, if something essential is left to be agreed upon by the parties at a later time, there is no binding agreement. The intention of the parties, as discerned by the Court, to be bound or not to be bound should be paramount. If the Court is satisfied that the parties intended to be bound, it will strive to find a means of giving effect to that intention by filling the gap. On the other hand, if the Court takes the view that the parties did not intend to be bound unless they themselves filled the gap (that they were not content to leave that task to the Court or a third party), then the agreement will not be binding.<br>&emsp;&emsp;On its own facts we respectfully doubt that <i>May and Butcher</i> would be decided by their Lordships in the same way today. We are now perhaps more accustomed to resort to arbitration in order to settle even matters of considerable importance to the contracting parties. We find curious the notion that, in a commercial contract where price is left to be agreed, a reasonable price cannot be fixed and that, even where there is an arbitration clause, that clause cannot be used to determine the price because &#8220;unless the price has been fixed, the agreement is not there&#8221;.<br>&emsp;&emsp;We agree with Professor McLauchlan (Rethinking Agreements to Agree (1998) 18 NZULR 77, 85) that &#8220;an agreement to agree will not be held void for uncertainty if the parties have provided a workable formula or objective standard or a machinery (such as arbitration) for determining the matter which has been left open&#8221;. We also agree with him that the court can step in and apply the formula or standard if the parties fail to agree or can substitute other machinery if the designated machinery breaks down”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It would be quixotic to claim that <i>May &amp; Butcher</i> can be fully rehabilitated and made to stand as the current approach of the law to inchoate agreements. However, by the use of casuistry, at least something can be done to make the decision less puzzling. How similar to <i>Hillas v Arcos</i> is <i>May &amp; Butcher</i>, in fact?<br>&emsp;&emsp;In <i>Hillas v Arcos</i>, an agreement is acted upon until the point at which the seller puts it out of his power to continue performance, having chosen to dispose of the goods elsewhere. The buyer sues for damages, presumably the discount to market value constituted by the deal. The seller defends himself by reference to the vagueness of the original agreement. It would have seemed unfair to the buyer if this defence had prevailed on any but the strongest facts.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In <i>May &amp; Butcher</i>, attempts were made to agree on the price of the tentage, but they failed. The suppliants&#8217; claim for damages, however formulated, would have to take as its main point of reference the price at which the goods would have been acquired if the contract had been performed. But this was the very thing which the parties had been unable to agree. And not only did the suppliants sue for damages – they also sought an injunction against the Controller of Disposals to prevent him selling the tentage elsewhere. It is difficult enough to get a court to order the performance of a public duty. The injunction sought in this case would have amounted to an order <i>restraining</i> the performance of a public duty. The suppliants&#8217; case actually looks quite as speculative now as it did when it came before the House of Lords in 1929.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If you have found this part of contract difficult, bear in mind the following.<br>&emsp;&emsp;You can consider that you have engaged with the subject and acquired at least a functioning grasp of it if you can assemble a brief set of principles something like those below, and can apply them to facts. Here, I give a range of suggestions by way of example, without intending it to be exhaustive.<br>&emsp;&emsp;- The words “subject to contract” usually prevent an agreement from binding;<br>&emsp;&emsp;- An agreement for exclusive negotiations will bind if expressly limited in duration;<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Problems of incompleteness or vagueness are more easily overcome if the contract has been acted upon;<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Commercial context and contractual interpretation are also vital determinants of the court&#8217;s willingness to fill gaps, or sever difficulties;<br>&emsp;&emsp;- There are fault lines running through the decided cases; judges do not all share the same view of good faith or adversarial negotiation;<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Casuistry also plays a part in outcomes; principles can and will be bent to refuse speculative claims.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-137'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Consideration - Definitions of Consideration</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;A written agreement made between the plaintiff (the widow of John Thomas) and the deceased&#8217;s executors provided that a cottage forming part of his estate was to be conveyed to her. The agreement further stated that by his will John Thomas had left all his property to his executors, but that since they were convinced it was his desire that his widow should have the cottage for life or as long as she remained unmarried, “in consideration of such desire” the cottage was to be hers. The agreement also required the plaintiff to make an annual payment of £1 towards the ground rent to the executors. The agreement was not carried out. A jury awarded the plaintiff £100 in damages for its breach, and it was held on appeal that she was entitled to recover. The agreement was binding, being supported by consideration in the form of the contribution towards the ground rent.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Patteson J distinguished between the named “consideration” for the promise to convey the cottage, and the consideration in law: “The cause for the gift was unquestionably respect for the memory of the testator, but we must not confound motive with consideration. A consideration, such as is recognised and known to our law, means a consideration of some value, moving from the plaintiff. Mere respect for the memory and wishes of a testator cannot be in any way construed as such. It is then argued, that, this being so, there is no consideration for the agreement at all, and that it is an agreement for a voluntary gift on certain conditions; but, looking at the agreement, we find, not a mere proviso, but an express agreement by the plaintiff to pay £1 towards a certain ground-rent...”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;There are two points to note here. The first is the distinction drawn between motive and consideration. If we ask why a promise is given, there will tend to be two answers. There will be the promisor&#8217;s reasons for giving it; these may well not amount to consideration. Consideration must be something asked of the promisee. The second point is that what is asked of the promisee, and found here by the court to amount to consideration, is a mere <i>contribution </i>toward a ground-rent, and there is no concern to measure its worth against the benefit which is being provided to her in return. From this, an essential principle of the law of consideration can be deduced; the law pays no regard to the adequacy of consideration. No equation is set up to measure the consideration against what it is acquiring. This will be discussed in more detail very shortly.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The passage above includes the notion that consideration must move from the plaintiff. Hamson wrote in terms of offeror and offeree, and this lecture earlier used the expressions “promisor/promisee”. Here is potential for confusion. What is the correct terminology?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">All these terms are in a sense correct. Consideration received in return for a promise makes that promise legally binding, and therefore it is appropriate to speak of consideration moving from the promisee. The promise may be that of the offeror (but one might equally be focusing on the offeree&#8217;s promise, made binding by consideration received from the offeror). The notion that consideration must move from the plaintiff makes sense in the context of a trial; it is the plaintiff who is likely to be suing on the basis that the defendant has breached a contractual promise, and to show that the promise was a binding one, it will be for the plaintiff to establish that he gave consideration for it.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Another formulation which it is best to avoid is one which in fact springs rather readily to mind in this area, namely that consideration makes a contract binding. In a sense this not wrong, but it may be misleading if it leads one to look at a contract to find something that can be called “consideration”, and then to conclude that this is what gives the contract its legal force. More accurately, consideration makes a promise binding. Since bilateral contracts (the majority) will comprise two promises, the one being exchanged against the other, there will be two bits of consideration within the arrangement, not one. In the context of litigation, the consideration pleaded (proved before the court) will be the consideration provided in return for the promise which allegedly has been breached. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">All the rules regarding consideration and set out in the remainder of this lecture can be summed up in one well-known proposition; consideration must be sufficient, but need not be adequate. A moment&#8217;s thought will be sufficient to suggest that this principle is ineptly phrased, since “adequate” and “sufficient” are regarded by the dictionary as synonyms. However, English contract law traditionally takes a different view. “Adequacy” is taken to mean “equal in value to the performance (or promise of it) in exchange for which the consideration is given. “Sufficient” means “consistent with the legal rules which the courts have developed in this area”.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">By drawing on what you already know of the outlook of the courts, you may well be able to suggest why consideration need not be adequate or, as it is often put, why the courts will not investigate the adequacy of consideration. If it were otherwise, the courts would be obliged to value the performances of both parties to ensure that they equalled each other in value. This would be to place an intolerably inconvenient hurdle in the way of proving a contract, and would produce serious uncertainty. More fundamentally, such a rule would fly in the face of freedom of contract. A disadvantageous exchange, by which one party forfeits value, is no less a contract than an advantageous one. Indeed, the one party&#8217;s disadvantage will very probably be the other&#8217;s advantage. The business of the courts is to uphold contracts, not to pass judgment on the parties&#8217; wisdom in making them.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The copyright of the music was vested in Chappell &amp; Co. By statute, a royalty was payable to the holder of the copyright on the “ordinary retail selling price” of the copies made. Chappell sought an injunction against Nestle to prevent a breach of copyright on the basis that 1s 6d was not the ordinary retail selling price. The value of the wrappers also needed to be taken into account. The competing view was that the sending in of the wrappers constituted a mere qualification enabling a purchaser to take advantage of the offer. The House of Lords held, by a bare majority, that Chappell&#8217;s contention was correct. The wrappers were part of the requested consideration, even though they were thrown away on receipt by Nestle. It follows that the wrappers would have been capable of constituting the entire consideration.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Reid, in the majority, was of opinion that although the receipt of the wrappers might confer no direct benefit on Nestle in some cases, there must have been many more in which it did. The whole point of the offer of “Rockin&#8217; Shoes” was to induce people to buy more of Nestle&#8217;s chocolate, and some certainly would have done so. Furthermore, “there may have been an indirect benefit by way of advertisement”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Somervell of Harrow, also in the majority, goes much further than this in his speech: “It is said that when received the wrappers are of no value to Nestle&#8217;s. This I would have thought irrelevant. A contracting party can stipulate for what consideration he chooses. A peppercorn does not cease to be good consideration if it is established that the promisee [sic] does not like pepper and will throw away the corn. As the whole object of selling the record, if it was a sale, was to increase the sales of chocolate, it seems to me wrong not to treat the stipulated evidence of such sales as part of the consideration. For these reasons I would allow the appeal”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Professor J.C. Smith, writing in 1979, notices just how radical a view this is: “The language of benefit and detriment is, and I believe long has been, out of date. So is the idea that consideration must be an economic benefit of some kind. All that is necessary is that the defendant should, expressly or impliedly, ask for something in return for his promise. If he gets what he asked for, then the promise is given for good consideration unless there is some vitiating factor. Though lip-service has been paid to the notions of benefit and detriment, they have no substantial meaning, in light of the principle that the court will not enquire into the adequacy of the consideration. If I make a promise to you in return for your supplying me with three, quite useless, chocolate wrappers, which I will instantly throw away, there is a perfectly good contract provided that the promise was seriously intended. I have got what I asked for and that is a sufficient “benefit”. You have parted with something that you might have kept and that is a sufficient “detriment”. But the wrappers are of no value to me, and you are perhaps glad to be rid of them. As for economic value, the judges have recognised, for over a century, the validity of the contract to pay £100 if the promisee will walk to York; and no one has ever demonstrated what economic value there is in walking to York”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Professor Smith&#8217;s “mere stipulation” theory of consideration is attractive; consideration is <i>anything</i> (provided it is not vitiated by illegality etc.) which the promisor requests of the promisee. That said, the language of benefit and detriment may be out of date, but it would be unwise to discard it completely; it provides a ready and fairly reliable way of scanning for consideration on the facts of the average case, and of avoiding getting the roles of promisor and promisee mixed up. It also explains how his knock-down answer to <span class="bd">Treitel</span>&#8216;s requirement of value in fact works. There may be no economic value in walking to York, or using the carbolic smoke-ball for two weeks, but these activities certainly involve a detriment to the promisee sustained at the request of the promisor.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">If Professor Smith is right (and his view is worthy of very great respect), then how is one to reconcile the notion that consideration can be anything at all with Patteson J&#8217;s requirement in Thomas v Thomas that it should be “of value in the eye of the law”? It can be done. Patteson J&#8217;s formulation does impose a limit on Smith&#8217;s proposition, but it is one which the latter would have accepted. “Value”, here, is subjectively assessed. Reference to “the eye of the law” can be understood to import the requirement that the consideration, whatever it is, should at least be capable of being objectively shown to have moved from the promisee. All that is excluded from Smith&#8217;s “anything” are purported considerations which cannot be ascertained to be present or absent by the ordinary adduction of evidence before a court. So, for example, a promise coupled with the request “that you treat me more as you used to”, would probably not be given for consideration. It is too uncertain to stand up to proof or challenge.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Before leaving <i>Chappell v Nestle</i>, and perhaps recalling it through Professor Smith&#8217;s eyes, you should note that it provides a very narrow basis for his theory. The passage from Lord Somervell&#8217;s speech quoted above is the only statement of such radicality in the case. The other members of the majority in the House of Lords are intent on finding some actual though derivative benefit to Nestle through the request for the wrappers (or their provision). What is more, Lord Somervell&#8217;s statement, read in its immediate context, is no more than a rebuttal of the objection that the wrappers cannot be of value to Nestle since the company throws them away on receipt. His whole speech occupies a bare half page of the law report. Firmer ground for Professor Smith&#8217;s view could perhaps be found in cases which minimise the importance of consideration itself as a necessary constituent of a binding agreement. The most striking example, <i>The Eurymedon</i>, is set out later in this lecture.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The question of what is of value in the eye of the law has been discussed in a line of cases involving something which the courts have strong views – disputed legal claims.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The Commissioners, bringing the claim, assumed that the defendant was liable to pay as an owner of houses in the district affected. In fact he was not, since he was merely the agent for the owner, but on being threatened with legal action he promised to pay a sum of money in three instalments to compromise the claim. He failed to pay the third instalment. He defended the present proceedings by arguing that the plaintiffs had given no consideration in return for his promise to pay, since the action for the contribution did not lie against him. He had therefore compromised a claim which, if pursued, could not have succeeded against him. The court held that he had received consideration; he had been spared the expense and trouble of legal proceedings.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The defendant was strictly correct in asserting that the claim brought against him, if pursued, must have failed and was therefore worthless. Various factors seem in combination to prevent the court reaching the conclusion that he therefore received something which was of no value in the eye of the law. Express notice was taken of the fact that he had avoided being sued (as at the time the deal was struck, at least). It is also suggested by various commentators that there is a public policy interest in upholding agreements to compromise disputed claims, and there are judicial dicta to the effect that a claim can hardly be declared valueless unless it has been tried; this happens to correspond with the basic principle that the court will not judge the adequacy of consideration. Furthermore, to argue that a promise may be breached because it is technically unsupported by consideration is never an attractive one. <span class="bd">McKendrick</span> goes further, and suggests that the plaintiff commissioners had sustained a detriment by being induced not to take action against the actual owner of the house.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The point to take away from this is that alongside a requested consideration which itself seems valueless, there may be alternative advantages to the promisor or concomitant disadvantages to the promise which can rank as consideration themselves. There may also be <i>good reasons</i> for upholding the deal, and they may draw the court&#8217;s attention away from the technical absence of consideration. This last notion, which may well seem surprisingly sub-legal, is explored at the end of the lecture.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The defendant then failed to pay, arguing that the plaintiff had no cause of action against him, and the plaintiff sued. The court found as fact that there was no cause of action, and that the plaintiff knew as much. The giving up of a claim brought in bad faith did not amount to consideration.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">McKendrick</span> finds it curious that the law attributes such importance to the state of mind of the claimant: “One might expect the law to conclude either that a promise to give up a worthless claim is not good consideration (on the basis that nothing of value is given in promising to give up a worthless claim) or that it is good consideration (on the basis that the defendant is freed from the nuisance of having to defend the claim. Instead the law has adopted an uneasy compromise that rests on the knowledge of the claimant”. He attributes this balance to the need, on the one hand, to encourage the settlement of claims, and on the other hand, to discourage parties from knowingly bringing bad claims in order to extort settlement on terms.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">This is probably right, but the situation bears comparison with what has already been seen of the snapping up cases. There, the judicial focus seemed to stray onto the offeree&#8217;s actual knowledge that the offer was mistakenly being made to him, whereas the principled test was whether a reasonable person in the offeree&#8217;s position would have realised the mistake. The fact is that guilty knowledge and bad faith are very hard to overlook, whether they are germane to a principled legal analysis or not. A bargain flawed by bad faith is not going to be upheld by a court, whether or not it is supported by consideration. To put it another way, it may be that the definition of consideration excludes dealings vitiated by bad faith, together with all other dealings that courts do not wish to support.

When I answer this in the affirmative, I am aware that a man&#8217;s marriage with the woman of his choice is in one sense a boon, and in that sense the reverse of a loss; yet, as between the plaintiff and the party promising an income to support the marriage, it may be a loss. The plaintiff may have made the most material changes in his position, and have induced the object of his affections to do the same, and have incurred pecuniary liabilities resulting in embarrassments, which would be in every sense a loss, if the income which had been promised should be withheld...”.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">First, the detriment found here by way of consideration is speculative. However, the majority of the House of Lords in Chappell v Nestle was content with largely speculative advantage to Nestle, so this objection is not fatal. The real problem is the way in which Erle CJ envisages the detriment crystallising to become “in every sense a loss”. The trigger is a breach of the promise which the consideration is to support. If qualifying detriment can be found in a breach of contract, then every promise comes accompanied by automatic consideration simply in so far as it may be broken. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it"> A kinder interpretation would be that Erle CJ regards the jeopardy of the nephew&#8217;s (putative) financial commitments as sufficient detriment to amount to consideration, referring to the possibility of breach merely to indicate the nature of that jeopardy. But even on this view, would these commitments, whether putative or demonstrated, be sufficiently linked to the uncle&#8217;s promise? In reality, what Erle CJ bases himself on here is reliance rather than consideration. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Since they agreed not to dispose of the shares for a stated period, they negotiated an undertaking from the defendants to buy the shares back at a stated value in order to lessen their exposure to a possible fall in the share price. When the plaintiffs later realised that this undertaking left them vulnerable to give up the shares at the same value even if they had risen above it on the open market, they insisted on the defendants granting them a guarantee that would protect them if the share price fell, but leave them free to profit if the price rose. The stated consideration was the plaintiffs&#8217; performance of the main agreement. In fact the share price slumped, and the defendants later maintained that they received no consideration for the guarantee they had given, since it was past (and they argued that the guarantee had been procured by economic duress). The Privy Council held that the main agreement was not fully executed at the time the guarantee was given, so that sufficient consideration was given by the plaintiffs&#8217; promise to perform it. It was not voidable for duress.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Scarman (obiter) stated three factors which would be required for technically past consideration to be regarded as sufficient on the doctrine of implied assumpsit:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“An act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise. The act must have been done at the promisors&#8217; request: the parties must have understood that the act was to be remunerated either by a payment or by the conferment of some other benefit: and payment, or the conferment of a benefit, must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance.

The stated consideration was the performance of an existing agreement. Will the law find “benefit”to the promisor in a performance which the promisee is already bound to provide?

He sued for breach of a promise by the defendant to pay him one guinea a day for his time and trouble. His action failed on the basis that the duty to attend and testify was imposed by law. A promise to pay for carrying out this legally imposed duty was unsupported by consideration.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Observe the language used by Lord Tenterden CJ in this case: “If it be a duty imposed by law upon a party regularly subpoenaed to attend from time to time to give his evidence then a promise to give him any remuneration for loss of time incurred in such attendance is a promise without consideration. We think that such a duty is imposed by law; and on consideration of the Statute of Elizabeth, and of the cases which have been decided on this subject, we are all of the opinion that a party cannot maintain an action for compensation for loss of time in attending a trial as a witness. We are aware of the practice which has prevailed in certain cases, of allowing, as costs between party and party, so much per day for the attendance of professional men, but that practice cannot alter the law. What the effect of our decision may be, is not for our consideration. We think, on principle, that an action does not lie for compensation to a witness for loss of time in attendance under a subpoena”.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">This extract does establish that the case is authority for the principle for which it is usually cited, but Lord Tenterden CJ does not limit himself to saying that performance of an existing legal duty is not consideration. He goes on to state, twice, that an action cannot be maintained for compensation for loss of time in attending a trial as a witness. The relation between this statement and the consideration point is disputable. It could be read as merely a broad or general way of saying why the plaintiff fails. Alternatively, it may be that the apparently principled position on the insufficiency of performance of an existing legal duty as consideration is no more than an abstract way of stating that witnesses are not to be allowed to sue for contractual remuneration (for reasons of policy). To examine this distinction may seem a singularly pointless enquiry. It is not. The question it poses is this; are such cases resolved by the application of principles of consideration, or are they resolved on more specific grounds even though the outcome may be put in terms of consideration? This is the theme which will be addressed directly at the end of the lecture. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Where the activity of the promisee involves the performance of a duty imposed by general law, a court will still be able to find consideration if it appears that the promisee is in fact doing more than his duty requires.

The captain attempted to recruit replacements, but failed to do so. He then promised the remainder of the crew that he would divide the wages of the two deserters between them in return for their promise to work the ship home short-handed. Upon the ship&#8217;s return the claim for the extra wages was not honoured. The question was whether the sailors had given consideration for the captain&#8217;s promise of the extra wages, given that they were already contractually bound to serve for the duration of the voyage. It was held that they had not.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This was one of a number of cases arising out of similar situations. In an earlier one, <i>Harris v Watson</i> (1791), the claim for extra wages failed on public policy grounds because the court was unwilling to create a precedent that might tempt sailors to extort promises of further payment from masters by duress. There are two reports of <i>Stilk v Myrick</i>. In that of the notoriously unreliable law reporter Espinasse, Lord Ellenborough is said to have approved the policy basis of the earlier decision. In the other (Campbell&#8217;s report), Lord Ellenborough is quoted as expressly distancing himself from reasoning based on duress. The agreement to pay extra was unenforceable simply because the sailors had done no more than they were already bound to do: “They had sold all their services till the voyage should be completed. If they had been at liberty to quit the vessel at Cronstadt, the case would have been quite different; or if the captain had capriciously discharged the two men who were wanting, the others might not have been compellable to take the whole duty upon themselves, and their agreeing to do so might have been a sufficient consideration for the promise of an advance of wages. But the desertion of a part of the crew is to be considered an emergency of the voyage as much as their death, and those who remain are bound by the terms of their original contract to exert themselves to the utmost to bring the ship in safety to her destined port”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>Stilk v Myrick</i>, despite its age, sets the scene for continuing debate within this area of law. If a promise made in return for the performance of existing duties is not to be upheld, which of the two competing rationales (duress and lack of consideration) best explains why that is? To reject such arrangements for duress is not the most transparent way of dealing with them. There was no duress on the facts in <i>Stilk v Myrick</i>, so in reality the objection is based merely on fear of future duress. Such a policy-based concern is not self-evidently an improper ground for decision, but it may be preferable to judge cases on their own facts, reserving the right to reject a claim for duress where in fact it can be shown to have been applied. As for the alternative of finding no consideration in these circumstances, it should by now be apparent that this really amounts to stating an outcome rather than showing why it is a correct or necessary outcome. There is no sufficient reason to uphold the deal – but why not? Must the theory of bargain dictate the same conclusion in every case in which more is offered in return for the performance of an existing duty? Another way forward would be to acknowledge that claims of this sort may sometimes not be worthy of support, but that sometimes they <i>will</i> be based on promises which have been made for good reason. As <i>Williams v Roffey</i> shows (below), this is the way that English law has tentatively gone, but it is a controversial development.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The plaintiffs ran into financial difficulties while working for the defendants, partly because the parties had agreed an unusually low price for the work, and partly because the plaintiffs failed to supervise their workers properly. The defendants would be liable to penalties if the work were not done on time. They therefore agreed to pay more money in return for the plaintiffs finishing their work by the contractual deadline. The defendants failed to pay, and argued that the plaintiffs had given no consideration for the promise to pay more, since they were to do nothing other than what they were already bound by contract to do anyway. The Court of Appeal held that the promise to pay more was enforceable. The principle of <i>Stilk v Myrick</i> remained good law, so that a gratuitous promise was not enforceable (unless made in a deed). Where, however, the promise conferred a practical advantage on the promisor, the court would find that it was supported by consideration.

Whether this is a proper legal development must depend on the view one takes of what consideration is, and the role that it plays or ought to play in the law.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If consideration is a body of technical rules, this case appears to breach them. This is the view of Professor Coote, who argues that the case purports to abolish the need for consideration to support the variation of contracts. If, as Russell LJ says in <i>Williams v Roffey</i>, the assessment of consideration should reflect the parties&#8217; intentions, then there is certainly consideration on these facts – but the doctrine now seems virtually to have merged with the parallel analysis of intention to create legal relations (the subject of the next lecture).<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the first condition of his six-part statement of principle in <i>Williams v Roffey</i>, Glidewell LJ carefully limits its application to cases in which the promisee has undertaken to do work for, or to supply good or services to the promisor. The ratio of the case therefore does not cover an undertaking to pay money to the promisor. An attempt to extend <i>Williams v Roffey</i> to cases involving obligations of debt was made and rejected in <i>Re Selectmove</i> (already cited in an earlier lecture, on the issue of acceptance by silence). Part payment of debt is governed by the House of Lords&#8217; decision in <i>Foakes v Beer</i>, and that prevents extension of the reasoning in <i>Williams v Roffey</i> into this area. <i>Foakes v Beer</i> will be examined in its own right very shortly.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The company argued that it had given consideration for this alleged agreement by agreeing to pay its debt to the Revenue in instalments. In the Court of Appeal Peter Gibson LJ held that this could not be regarded as consideration for the alleged promise, since the company was doing no more than it was already obliged to do. “The difficulty that I feel with [the argument that <i>Williams v Roffey</i> should apply] is that if the principle of <i>Williams</i>&#8216; case is to be extended to an obligation to make payment, it would in effect leave the principle in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> without any application. Where a creditor and a debtor who are at arm&#8217;s length reach agreement on the payment of the debt by instalments to accommodate the debtor, the creditor will no doubt always see a practical benefit to himself in so doing. In the absence of authority there would be much to be said for the enforceability of such a contract. But that was a matter expressly considered in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> yet held not to constitute good consideration in law. <i>Foakes v Beer</i> was not even referred to in <i>Williams&#8217;</i> case, and it is in my judgment impossible, consistently with the doctrine of precedent, for this court to extend the principle of <i>Williams</i>&#8216; case to any circumstances governed by the principle of <i>Foakes v Beer</i>.

It was held that his defence failed, since he should additionally have pleaded that he tendered it in full satisfaction. Had he done so, it would have been good satisfaction for the whole debt because of the early payment. Coke CJ said, obiter: “that payment of a lesser sum on the day in satisfaction of a greater cannot be any satisfaction for the whole, because it appears to the judges that by no possibility a lesser sum can be satisfaction to the plaintiff for a greater sum: but the gift of a horse, hawk or robe etc., in satisfaction is good for it shall be intended that a horse, hawk or robe etc, might be more beneficial to the plaintiff than the money, in respect of some circumstances, or otherwise the plaintiff would not have accepted it in satisfaction”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This remarkable case needs more than a little explanation. It is of relevance only for the obiter statement above which was entirely unnecessary to the decision but has steered English law within this area for four centuries.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The words “it appears to the judges” indicate a conclusion which is based not upon evidence but upon the judges&#8217; common experience; the idea is akin to the principle of “judicial notice” being taken of a fact which has not been subject to formal proof. “It shall be intended” is the seventeenth century legal English term for an irrebuttable presumption of law. The presumption in question arises when the creditor requests (the need for a request is stated later by Coke CJ) and accepts a “horse, hawk or robe etc” in full satisfaction for a debt on the due date, either in addition to part payment or instead of any payment at all. A “horse, hawk or robe etc” seems to be a way of referring to anything whatsoever that the debtor was not bound by the original agreement to provide. The reason this works as satisfaction is because of the irrebuttable legal presumption of the possibility of benefit to the creditor, and because of the standard proposition that the law will not judge the adequacy of consideration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> also makes it clear that part payment requested and accepted before the due day will function in the same way as a “horse, hawk or robe etc”. The court will presume from its acceptability to the creditor it that could have been more beneficial than a later payment in full.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The “Rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i>” is not difficult to understand, but it is intellectually troubling. Why should the law take a point on the inadequacy of part payment, when the general rule is that consideration need not be adequate? And how can the law maintain the fiction that any thing will do as substituted performance, when its inadequacy may be quite as obvious as that of part payment?<br>&emsp;&emsp;If one asks why part payment on the day cannot function like a horse, hawk, robe, peppercorn or chocolate wrapper, the answer normally given is that the creditor is receiving nothing new or additional by way of consideration for his promise to set aside the debt. Another reason, which perhaps goes further into the minds of the judges at the time of <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i>, is a little more nuanced. The provision of some new thing suggests the making of a new agreement to terminate the original debt. The making of part payment suggests nothing more than a payment on account towards the discharge of the debt. It will readily be seen why the judges are ready to value that part payment to find it wanting, and thereby seem to ignore the rule that consideration need not be adequate. They do not assess it as consideration at all, but as an attempt to discharge a duty. It appears to them, correctly, that a duty is either discharged or not discharged.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">A somewhat different answer now follows – you may well not want to spend time on it. Pinnel&#8217;s Case concerned a penal bond with conditional defeasance. This type of arrangement, extremely common at the time, amounted to an agreement that one party would be subject (in debt) to a draconian penalty subject only to the condition that if they did something else first (the envisaged performance), they would be entitled not to pay the penalty. The envisaged performance could consist in conduct, or in the payment of a sum of money, much less than the penalty. Pinnel&#8217;s Case was of course an arrangement of the latter type, envisaging payment.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Under the penal bond with conditional defeasance, the sum which is envisaged to be paid is not a debt, and therefore a case like Pinnel is not actually about the part payment of debt. The sum envisaged to be paid is a condition, and fulfilment of the condition will entitle the debtor not to pay the true debt owed under such a bond – the penal sum which is the technical subject of the agreement between the parties. Pinnel&#8217;s Case therefore decides what can validly be imported as a replacement condition into the agreement, and not what will discharge a debt. This refinement of perspective is slight, but nevertheless helpful. Where one party requests and accepts a chattel instead of the envisaged payment, the court&#8217;s conclusion will be that the condition must have been varied; a different thing is being done. Where, however, part payment is made on the day, nothing is being done to suggest that the original condition has been replaced by a different one. The part payment will be taken to be referable to the original condition. If one asks (with the early seventeenth century&#8217;s liking for formalism) whether part payment amounts to performance of that condition or not, only one answer is possible. It is the answer given by Coke CJ. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In 1884 the House of Lords had to decide whether part payment of a debt could be satisfaction for the full amount owing. The dictum in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> was upheld as good law.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He asked for time to pay. She agreed that if he made a down payment of £500 and then paid the remaining sum in instalments she would take no further action upon the judgment. Dr Foakes duly made all the stipulated repayments, but Mrs Beer then claimed that he was bound to pay interest on the debt as well. The House of Lords had to resolve two linked questions: (a) had Mrs Beer promised not to claim the interest, and if she had, (b) was her promise supported by consideration and therefore binding? Their Lordships differed as to whether Mrs Beer had promised not to claim interest, but all agreed that if she had, then her promise was not binding, because she had received nothing extra in return for that promise. The rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> was approved, though without much enthusiasm.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The issue on which <i>Foakes v Beer</i> seems to have turned was whether any benefit accrued or might accrue to the creditor through the acceptance of part payment of a debt on the due day. The sense in which the House considered this question is explained by the Earl of Selborne LC:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“What is called “any benefit, or even any legal possibility of benefit,” in Mr Smith&#8217;s notes to <i>Cumber v Wane</i> [a case following <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i>] is not (as I conceive) that sort of benefit which a creditor might derive from getting payment of part of the money due to him from a debtor who might otherwise keep him at arm&#8217;s length, or possibly become insolvent, but is some independent benefit, actual or contingent, of a kind which might in law be a good and valuable consideration for any other sort of agreement not under seal”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The most noteworthy speech in the case is that of Lord Blackburn. He stated that he thought the rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> to be wrong, because Lord Coke in that case was factually mistaken when he said that it could never be a benefit to the creditor to receive only part of what he was owed. On that basis, Lord Blackburn said that he had intended to dissent, and urge that <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> be overruled, and had even written his speech, but had changed his mind:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“What principally weighs with me in thinking that Lord Coke made a mistake of fact is my conviction that all men of business, whether merchants or tradesmen, do every day recognise and act on the ground that prompt payment of a part of their demand may be more beneficial to them than it would be to insist on their rights and enforce payment of the whole. Even where the debtor is perfectly solvent, and sure to pay at last, this is often so. Where the credit of the debtor is doubtful is must be more so. I had persuaded myself that there was no such long-continued action on this dictum [in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s case</i>] as to render it improper in this House to re-consider the question. I had written my reasons for so thinking; but as they were not satisfactory to the other noble and learned Lords who heard the case, I do not now repeat them nor persist in them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I assent to the judgment proposed, though it is not that which I had originally thought proper”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The following discussion raises three separate points. You do not need to linger over any of them unless you find them helpful.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">1. It is possible to come away from Foakes v Beer regarding the decision as a paradox. What would have given binding force to Mrs Beer&#8217;s promise not to require the interest? Nothing short of payment of the interest in full (or some substituted performance). The reason that Mrs Beer&#8217;s promise didn&#8217;t bind her is that Dr Foakes took her at her word. It can seem very odd that the doctrine of consideration leads to this result.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The best route away from the paradox is to recall the policy which lies behind the rule in Pinnel&#8217;s case. The law does not readily presume that a creditor intends to forgo a debt, but is alive to the risk that an unscrupulous debtor may try to trick a creditor into doing just that. In <span class="bd">Treitel</span>&#8216;s view (Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract Law) that is exactly what Dr Foakes&#8217; solicitor had tried to do here. The rule in Pinnel&#8217;s case stops it happening. If the creditor genuinely wishes to release the part-paying debtor, the use of a deed will achieve the intended result.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">2. The difference between the Earl of Selborne LC&#8217;s view and the near-dissent of Lord Blackburn is a narrow one. The crucial concept in the former&#8217;s discussion of the law is “some independent benefit”; Lord Blackburn, by contrast, had been sufficiently impressed by the real if not the independent benefit of a creditor&#8217;s getting at least some payment that he would have found consideration in that. (In fact they are still closer, because the Earl of Selborne LC stated that he would have regarded the adoption of Lord Blackburn&#8217;s preferred view as an improvement in the law, had he not thought the doctrine of precedent stood in the way of it). If the matter is to come down to the nature of the structural relation between an admitted benefit and the promise which it is to support, it is hard not to conclude that the analysis is too technical. Do the principles of consideration really require this, and if so, can their demand be justified? </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">3. On a wholly unrelated point, you may wonder whether there was not another way in which Foakes v Beer could have been decided. Mrs Beer was (or may have been) content to take somewhat less than the full sum which she was owed by giving up the interest on the money due to her. Dr Foakes was willing to and did pay this agreed sum. Were the parties not compromising a claim? Not surprisingly, this does not work. The compromised claim cases involve disputed or unliquidated claims. Mrs Beer&#8217;s claim was for a debt which was not subject to dispute; it was backed by a High Court judgment. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">h3>Two of the exceptions to the rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> do not so much confine it as apply it, and are in fact both alluded to in Coke CJ&#8217;s note of what the case decided. The first, already mentioned, is that part payment of a debt is good satisfaction for a promise to relinquish the whole provided it is requested and accepted in full satisfaction before the due date. These were the facts of <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> itself, and would have given the defendant a good defence had it not been for the error of pleading on which the decision in fact turned. </h3</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">h3>The second exception is where the part payment is requested and accepted in full satisfaction at a place other than the one originally fixed for payment. On the extraordinarily technical perspective of the early seventeenth century, either of these arrangements can be regarded not merely as payment on account towards the discharge of the full debt, but as satisfaction for an independent accord to relinquish the full debt.</h3</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">h3>Payment at a different place seems, however, to count as substituted performance only if it is genuinely beneficial to the creditor, as the next case shows.</h3</span></p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The plaintiff, who was indebted to the defendants, had allegedly been promised that they would not serve a bankruptcy notice on him if he paid the debt on 7 July. On 6 July, the plaintiff informed the defendants that he could not pay on the following day, but that he could borrow the money in Eastbourne on 8 July. The plaintiffs asked him to pay it in at a bank in Eastbourne to the credit of their solicitor&#8217;s account in London. The plaintiff did so, but his letter informing the defendants&#8217; solicitor of this was not delivered. The bankruptcy notice was therefore served on him. He sued for breach of the promise not to serve the notice. His action failed since it was held on appeal that the request to pay the money in Eastbourne had been a mere “voluntary indulgence” to the plaintiff from which the defendants derived no actual benefit. The agreement was unsupported by consideration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A third exception to the rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> exists where the part payment is made to the creditor <b>by someone other than the debtor.</b</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He had given a bond and a promissory note in return for the loan. He was unable to pay it back, and the plaintiffs wrote to his father, Sir Richard Temple. Sir Richard sent a banker&#8217;s draft for a sum less than the full debt, making it clear that he intended it to be in full and final settlement. The plaintiffs wrote back saying that they required payment in full, and that they would cash the draft and hold the money on account. They then sued the defendant for the remainder of the debt. It was held that they must be deemed to have accepted the money on the terms on which it was offered, and thus in full and final settlement. Their right to the remainder had been extinguished.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;A number of reasons are given by the court to support this outcome. Some are far-fetched. Perhaps the most convincing – regardless of whether it is well supported by the facts of the case – is that the third party is concluding a new contract for the release of the debtor. On this view it at least cannot be said that the promisee (the third party) is doing no more than he was already bound to do, because he was not previously bound to do anything at all. There is therefore no reason to compare what is paid with what was originally owed.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The objection to this reasoning is that it merely provides a technical solution to a technically conceived problem of consideration that has little to do with the facts of the case. There was no agreement along the lines that the court&#8217;s analysis supposes. The plaintiffs were not content to conclude a new contract for the discharge of the defendant by which they lost money, and surely supposed that by cashing the banker&#8217;s draft they were merely doing what any other creditor would be entitled to do on receiving part payment of a debt. It is another flaw in the rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> that it can be manipulated to do the precise opposite of what it should – that is, to protect the rights of a creditor and distinguish genuine accords from bogus ones.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Another exception to the rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> is now defunct. It was formally held that the making of part payment <b>other than by cash</b> (for example by giving a negotiable instrument such as a cheque) amounted to substituted performance. In <i>D &amp; C Builders Ltd v Rees</i> (1965) the Court of Appeal held that the authorities on which this rule was based would be either distinguished or overruled for the reason that the distinction had come to appear wholly fictitious (and incidentally would have produced an unjust result in the instant case). The decision is discussed further in a different context below.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The question whether one may retract a concession has fortunately not been altogether left in the sclerotic grip of <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i>. In another line of cases, decided in the courts&#8217; equitable jurisdiction, a far more reasonable approach is adopted; should the promisor in fairness be allowed to retract a concession on which the promisee has relied? This approach does not exactly contradict the common law&#8217;s insistence that consideration must be found before the promisor will be contractually bound by his promise. Instead, it gives such limited effect to the promise as is necessary to avoid inequity.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The penalty for non-compliance was forfeiture of the lease. The tenants agreed to do the repairs, but suggested that the landlord might wish to buy the remaining term of the lease from them. They made it clear that the repairs would be deferred pending negotiations. Negotiations duly took place but were unsuccessful, and the landlord brought proceedings for possession at the expiry of six months from service of the original notice to repair. The House of Lords held that the six month period for repairs to take place did not run while negotiations were ongoing, but only from the point at which they had broken down.

I entirely fail to see any such possible distinction. The principle has nothing to do with forfeiture... It was applied in <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway</i> in a case in which equity could not relieve against forfeiture upon the mere ground that it was a forfeiture, but could interfere only because there had been something in the nature of acquiescence, or negotiations between the parties, which made it inequitable to allow the forfeiture to be enforced. The truth is that the proposition is wider than cases of forfeiture. It seems to me to amount to this, that if persons who have contractual rights against others induce by their conduct those against whom they have such rights to believe that such rights either will not be enforced or will be kept in suspense or abeyance for some particular time, those persons will not be allowed by a court of equity to enforce the rights until such time has elapsed, without at all events placing the parties in the same position as they were before. That is the principle to be applied. I will not say that it is not a principle that was recognised by courts of law as well as of equity. It is not necessary to consider how far it was always a principle of common law”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;If one takes these two cases together, it will be seen that what is envisaged as triggering reliance is an “act” or “consent” or “conduct”. It is one party&#8217;s behaviour, leading the other to infer that a contractual right will be suspended and to rely on that inference. As long as the doctrine amounts to no more than this, it is not obviously at odds with the common law, but can merely be understood as supplementing it, or – at most – mitigating the effects of the common law&#8217;s limited respect for reliance. However, the next case, which is one of the most famous in English contract law, goes somewhat further. It proposes that certain promises, once relied upon, have legal effect despite the absence of consideration.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

During the war years, it became difficult to let the flats because tenants feared for their safety. As a result the defendants were unable to pay the ground rent. The plaintiffs therefore promised that they would accept half the ground rent, and the defendants paid that reduced sum as it fell due from time to time. By 1945 the flats were fully let again, and a receiver who was now managing the plaintiffs&#8217; affairs brought the present action to establish what rent was owed to the plaintiffs. The claim was for the last two quarterly instalments of full ground rent which had fallen due after the flats were once again fully let. <span class="bd">Denning J</span> held that those sums were recoverable, since the concessionary reduction of the ground rent had been intended to last only as long as wartime conditions made it difficult for the defendants to pay the full ground rent. However, he said <i>obiter </i>that if the plaintiffs had sued for all the ground rent held back during the period, they would have been prevented from doing so by the rule in <i>Hughes</i>&#8216;s case. The principle was this: if a promise was made, which was intended to be relied upon, and was relied upon, then in equity the promisor would not be allowed to go back on the promise even though there were no consideration for it.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;“If I were to consider this matter without regard to recent developments in the law, there is no doubt that, had the plaintiffs claimed it, they would have been entitled to recover ground rent at the rate of £2,500 a year from the beginning of the term...<br>&emsp;&emsp;But what is the position in view of developments in the law in recent years? ... There has been a series of decisions over the past 50 years which, although they are said to be cases of estoppel are not really such. They are cases in which a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made, and which was in fact so acted on. In such cases the courts have said that the promise must be honoured. The cases to which I desire to refer are: <i>Fenner v Blake</i> [1900] 1 QB 426; <i>Re Wickham</i> (1917) 34 TLR 158; <i>Re William Porter &amp; Co Ltd</i> [1937] 2 All ER 361 and <i>Buttery v Pickard</i> [1946] WN 25. As I have said they are not really cases of estoppel in the strict sense. They are really promises – promises intended to be binding, intended to be acted on, and in fact acted on. <i>Jorden v Money</i> can be distinguished, because there the promisor made it clear that she did not intend to be legally bound, whereas in the cases to which I refer the proper inference was that the promisor did intend to be bound. In each case the court held the promise to be binding on the party making it, even though under the old common law it might be difficult to find any consideration for it. The courts have not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a promise, but they have refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it. It is in that sense, and that sense only, that such a promise gives rise to an estoppel. The decisions are a natural result of the fusion of law and equity: for the cases of <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co</i> (1877) 2 App Cas 439, 448; <i>Birmingham and District Land Co v London &amp; North Western Railway Co</i> (1888) 40 Ch D 268, 286; and <i>Salisbury (Marquess) v Gilmore</i> [1942] 2 KB 38, 51 afford a sufficient basis for saying that a party would not be allowed in equity to go back on such a promise. In my opinion, the time has now come for the validity of such a promise to be recognised. The logical consequence, no doubt, is that a promise to accept a smaller sum in discharge of a larger sum, if acted upon, is binding notwithstanding the absence of consideration: and if the fusion of law and equity leads to this result, so much the better. That aspect was not considered in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> (1884) 9 App Cas 605. At this time of day, however, when law and equity have been joined together for over 70 years, principles must be reconsidered in the light of their combined effect....<br>&emsp;&emsp;If the case had been one of estoppel, it might be said that in any event the estoppel would cease when the conditions to which the representation applied came to an end, or it also might be said that it would only come to an end upon notice. In either case it is only a way of ascertaining what is the scope of the representation. I prefer to apply the principle that a promise intended to be binding, intended to be acted on and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms properly apply. Here it was binding as covering the period down to the early part of 1945, and as from that time full rent is payable”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;A great deal has been written about the obiter part of <i>High Trees</i> – without a doubt it is Lord Denning&#8217;s most famous contract judgment. It requires study, preferably across a range of commentaries. It would be quite impossible here to give an academically exhaustive account, but it may be helpful to give a rough and ready checklist of the main issues.<br>&emsp;&emsp;First, since Lord Denning&#8217;s principle has become known as “promissory estoppel” (even though he initially seemed disinclined to adopt that label for it himself), it is appropriate to say what an estoppel is. Professor Birks explains that the word has its roots in the Norman French verb which denotes the stopping up of a container, such as a bottle, but he goes on to deduce from this the sense that “in short, one is bound”. This seems misleading. The core notion is not that somebody is bound, but that something is stopped up, and the thing that is stopped up is the mouth of a witness. Estoppel is essentially a rule of evidence which prevents a witness giving evidence which would be relevant if adduced, but which for reasons of fairness ought not to be adduced. Various estoppels are known to the law, and several labels are applied to them, but the key concept in all is that once the parties have conducted their business on a certain footing (eg. an assumption as to a particular fact), neither is permitted to deny that assumed fact even if it subsequently could be shown to be false. Justice here demands that consistency should prevail over truth.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Estoppel is known to the common law. One version of it appears in <i>Jorden v Money</i>, the case which Denning J carefully treads around in <i>High Trees</i>. That House of Lords case states that common law estoppel must be based on a statement of fact, not a promise. For a promise with regard to future conduct to give rise to any rights, it must of course be supported by consideration. Denning J acknowledges this, but finds two ways around the problem which it creates for him. The first is to distinguish <i>Jorden v Money</i> by reinterpreting it as a case in which there was no intention to create legal relations. The second is to avoid describing his own principle as an estoppel. The modern perspective simply consists in accepting that common law estoppel does require a statement of fact (a representation), but that there is also a second form of equitable or promissory estoppel which can be founded on a promise.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Since Denning J found some difficulty in appropriating the term “estoppel” to his use, he relies on a variety of cases to which several labels have been applied; the taxonomy is not agreed, but the word “waiver” is most used in connection with them. <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway</i>, as extended by the <i>Birmingham</i> case, is the chief of them for Denning J&#8217;s purposes, because it is a House of Lords authority, and because it derives the court&#8217;s ability to intervene from its equitable jurisdiction. As a result of <i>Hughes</i>, a promise, even though unsupported by consideration, can be set up as a defence to an action for breach of contract. In <i>Foakes v Beer</i>, a promise unsupported by consideration was of no effect. Because <i>Hughes</i> is decided in equity, Denning J is able to explain <i>Foakes v Beer</i> as a decision in which the (then recent) fusion of law and equity was overlooked.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Plainly, Denning J would have decided <i>Foakes v Beer</i> differently. Nevertheless, his proposal that “a promise to accept a smaller sum in discharge of a larger sum … is binding” is mischievous. His own statement of the effect of promissory estoppel stops short of that. Such a promise is given limited effect as a defence if equity requires it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">Treitel</span> argues that the House of Lords in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> was not likely to have been unaware of <i>Hughes&#8217; Case</i>, since it had been decided only seven years earlier and involved two of the judges who also sat in <i>Foakes v Beer</i>. He suggests that the two authorities are not at variance because rights were merely suspended in <i>Hughes</i>, whereas Dr Foakes maintained that Mrs Beer&#8217;s right to payment should be permanently extinguished. Much analysis of the cases in this area takes the distinction between suspension and extinction of rights to be fundamental, but in practice the distinction is not altogether clear-cut and needs to be regarded with a little caution. At first glance it does seem that the right of the landlord in <i>Hughes</i> to have the premises repaired was merely suspended. However, his right to the repairs within the original six months was permanently lost.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Professor Smith makes a different distinction between <i>Hughes</i> and <i>Foakes v Beer</i>. He says that the result of <i>Hughes</i> (and of other cases on waiver) is that a claimant cannot sue for a breach of contract which has been induced by his own behaviour. <i>Foakes v Beer</i>, on the other hand, does not involve a breach of contract. The claim is for performance of a duty – the payment of a debt in full. The debt remains payable because of the rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> even though the creditor has promised to forgo part of it. The express distinction, which is between induced non-performance and induced breach, hardly seems to work since the two will often amount to the same thing. The deeper distinction may be between obligated performance arising from debt, and promised performance arising from assumpsit (contract), but it is uncomfortably technical and this is not the place to pursue it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where in all this does the obiter principle in <i>High Trees</i> stand? On a broad view (not a technical one), it can permanently prevent the recovery of money due, and it therefore goes beyond <i>Hughes</i>. The judgment, both in appearance and expression, seems to come into conflict with <i>Foakes v Beer</i> even though it does not flatly contradict it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Can Denning J&#8217;s obiter doctrine stand? It is too firmly entrenched both here and in other common law jurisdictions to be overthrown. <i>Foakes v Beer</i> has been outflanked, and the two authorities co-exist in an uneasy tension. The factors which permit <i>High Trees</i> to maintain its position rather than simply falling before the decision of the superior court are these. First, it does not make a promise unsupported by consideration binding for all purposes. Such a promise is enforceable only as a defence, and not as a cause of action in its own right (which would still require it to be embodied in a contract and supported by consideration). Secondly, there must be some measure of reliance by the promisee on the promise. Thirdly, the promisor may be able to withdraw the promise by giving notice. Fourthly, the doctrine of <i>High Trees</i> is expressed to be derived from equity, and this allows it to claim the status of equity&#8217;s answer to the common law problem of <i>Foakes v Beer</i>. These factors, in combination, allow the conclusion that promissory estoppel has a place of its own and is not simply an impermissible negation of <i>Foakes v Beer.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Some of the lorries were withdrawn from service because they needed repairs. The defendant asked the plaintiff to do the repairs, and said that this would be paid for once the lorries were back in service. The plaintiff replied that full hire purchase payments did not need to be made while the lorries were out of service, but later claimed full payment. The defendant argued that the plaintiff was estopped from claiming full payment because the defendant had made changes to the organisation of his business on the basis that he would not have to pay in full. It was held that the evidence did not establish this, so that the estoppel argument failed. The promise had not been acted upon in the sense that the defendant had altered his position.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The extent to which reliance is adequately protected by contract law is a large and current topic of debate. To focus on the immediate issue, however, it makes perfect sense that the promisee should demonstrate reliance before any effect will be given to the promise by estoppel. If it were otherwise, the argument that the promise made no difference to anything would apply with its full and withering force. The requirement of reliance is a threshold qualification in other areas of contract law. In misrepresentation, for instance, an action cannot be maintained if a false statement in no way affected the claimant&#8217;s judgment.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the context of promissory estoppel, there has been debate whether the promisee&#8217;s reliance need be detrimental. A moment&#8217;s thought should be enough to suggest the correct answer. The facts of <i>High Trees</i> itself can stand as a guide; the locus classicus of promissory estoppel is itself a case of a merely concessionary promise which occasioned no detriment to the promisee and no benefit to the promisor. In a later case (<i>Alan v El Nasr</i> (1972)), Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> expressly denied that detrimental reliance was necessary. The true position is best explained in the following case, confirming Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span>&#8216;s view:</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The fundamental principle is that stated by Lord Cairns [in <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway</i>], viz. that the representor will not be allowed to enforce his rights “where it would be inequitable having regard to the dealings which have thus taken place between the parties”. To establish such inequity, it is not necessary to show detriment; indeed, the representee may have benefited from the representation, and yet it may be inequitable, at least without reasonable notice, for the representor to enforce his legal rights. Take the facts of <i>Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd</i> [1947] 1 KB 130, the case in which <span class="bd">Denning J</span> breathed new life into the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The representation was by a lessor to the effect that he would be content to accept a reduced rent. In such a case, although the lessee has benefited from the reduction in rent, it may well be inequitable for the lessor to insist upon his legal right to the unpaid rent, because the lessee has conducted his affairs on the basis that he would only have to pay rent at the lower rate; and a court might well think it right to conclude that only after reasonable notice could the lessor return to charging rent at the higher rate specified in the lease. Furthermore it would be open to the Court, in any particular case, to infer from the circumstances of the case that the representee must have conducted his affairs in such a way that it would be inequitable for the representor to enforce his rights, or to do so without reasonable notice. But it does not follow that in every case in which the representee has acted, or failed to act, in reliance on the representation, it will be inequitable for the representor to enforce his rights for the nature of the action, or inaction, may be sufficient to give rise to the equity, in which event a necessary requirement stated by Lord Cairns LC for the application for the doctrine would not have been fulfilled”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If the promisee&#8217;s reliance on the promise can be characterised as detrimental (detriment being found beyond the mere fact that he may face an action for breach of contract absent the defence of promissory estoppel), then the case may need careful handling. Consider the following decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

When the defendants leased another shop in the same centre to a similar business (a fruiterer), the plaintiffs experienced a drop in their turnover. They therefore sought and received a reduction in their rent from the defendants. The reduced rent was paid and accepted even after the defendants had required a return to full rent. At a certain point the defendants changed the locks on the plaintiffs&#8217; shop. The plaintiffs sued for damages and succeeded on the basis that the rent had been varied for good consideration. The court held that the promise to reduce the rent had given the defendants the benefit of keeping the shop occupied without having to look for an alternative tenant. It had cost the plaintiffs a detriment in the form of the risk they undertook by continuing to trade against a stronger competitor instead of leaving and cutting their potential losses. Although the plaintiffs were doing no more than what they were originally obliged to do by their lease, <i>Williams v Roffey</i> would be extended to cover this case (here protecting a decreasing rather than an increasing pact).</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Since this is an Australian case, it is merely persuasive authority in the courts of this country. What is more, it appears to go directly against the limitation of <i>Williams v Roffey</i> by <i>Re Selectmove</i> (see above). That aside, there are English cases in which a promisee&#8217;s reliance on a promise has led judges of the same court to go different ways; on more than one occasion Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> applied the <i>High Trees</i> doctrine, while others found a binding variation of contract on the basis of detriment or potential detriment.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The passage from the judgment of Robert Goff J in <i>The Post Chaser</i> above stands as a complete account in principle of the place of inequity in promissory estoppel. Little more needs to be said on a conceptual level, except to remark that there is a ready means of distinguishing between the detriment which might make a promise binding as a variation of the contract, and the inequity which promissory estoppel would remedy. Detriment, whatever form it takes, arises from the acceptance of the promise. Inequity, in an estoppel case, is found at a point later in time – upon the retraction of the promise.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Two cases add examples of courts&#8217; reasoning about inequity in the context of estoppel:</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

When the time came for settlement of the account, the plaintiffs were owed £483. They were in serious financial difficulty, as the defendants knew. Mrs Rees offered £300 in full and final settlement, making it clear that she would pay not a penny more, and that the alternative to acceptance on her terms was nothing. The plaintiffs accepted the sum offered since their circumstances gave them no realistic choice. They later brought an action for the balance. The Court of Appeal held that they succeeded. The majority of the court simply applied <i>Foakes v Beer</i>; on the rule in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i> there was no consideration for the plaintiffs&#8217; promise to Mrs Rees. Lord <span class="bd">Denning MR</span> treated the case as one of promissory estoppel, but ruled that the doctrine only applied when necessary to prevent inequity.

The claimant paid £200 a month, initially from the partnership&#8217;s bank account and later from his own resources. The claimant&#8217;s two partners were already bankrupt, and the defendant served a statutory demand on him for the full amount of the debt jointly owed. In an application to set aside the statutory demand, the claimant argued (a) that he had agreed with the defendant to give up his status as a joint debtor and to take on the status of a sole debtor for £200 a month, and that this amounted to consideration for a promise that he owed only the lesser sum; and (b) that the defendant was estopped from denying that only the lesser sum was owed. The Court of Appeal held that the first submission failed, but that the second submission raised a “genuine triable issue” sufficient to justify setting aside the statutory demand. In the judgment of <span class="bd">Arden LJ</span>, the effect of promissory estoppel on the promise to accept the lesser payment was to extinguish the creditor&#8217;s right to the balance of the debt.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Arden LJ formulated the following proposition as an application of the dicta in <i>High Trees</i> to the present dispute: “The facts of this case demonstrate that, if (1) a debtor offers to pay part only of the amount he owes; (2) the creditor voluntarily accepts that offer, and (3) in reliance on the creditor&#8217;s acceptance the debtor pays that part of the amount he owes in full, the creditor will, by virtue of the doctrine of promissory estoppel, be bound to accept that sum in full and final satisfaction of the whole debt. For him to resile will of itself be inequitable. In addition, in these circumstances, the promissory estoppel has the effect of extinguishing the creditor&#8217;s right to the balance of the debt. This part of our law originated in the brilliant obiter dictum of <span class="bd">Denning J</span> in the High Trees case [1947] KB 130”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Longmore LJ, in the same case, was doubtful whether it was inequitable for the defendant to resile from the promise to accept part payment, but accepted that the facts did at least raise a triable issue. Two linked points should be made about Arden LJ&#8217;s notion of automatic inequity. The first is to emphasise that it applies only to part payment of debt, and not to other settings in which promissory estoppel may come into play. The second is a call for caution. An orthodox understanding of promissory estoppel requires the presence or absence of inequity to be assessed in every case on the facts. It would be strange if one application of promissory estoppel differed from all the others in this respect. What is more, the case by case assessment of what equity may demand has already been proposed above as one of the means by which the <i>High Trees</i> doctrine can claim to co-exist with <i>Foakes v Beer</i> and <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i>. If promissory estoppel <i>automatically</i> applies to cases of part payment of debt, then <i>Foakes v Beer</i> is left without any application. There is already the authority of <i>Re Selectmove</i> to suggest that this is not consistent with the doctrine of binding precedent.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In 1942 TECO stopped making the payments, and TMMC agreed that they would not claim for them pending negotiation of a new contract. The negotiations failed, and in 1946 TMMC counterclaimed for the payments in an action brought by TECO. The counterclaim was successfully resisted by promissory estoppel, and by the Court of Appeal&#8217;s finding that rights to the payments could only be revived by the giving of notice. The compensation payments withheld were therefore irrecoverable. In 1950 TMMC brought a fresh action claiming payments due since 1947. This claim succeeded in the House of Lords, which held that notice reviving the right to the payments had been given by the making of the counterclaim in the earlier action. The House of Lords decision contains no criticism of the Court of Appeal judgment in the earlier action which deprived TMMC of its accrued rights to payment.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail </span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;In the House of Lords, Lord Tucker helpfully gave guidance as to when notice would and would not be required in equity before a promise might be terminated and future contractual rights revived:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“It has been said more than once that every case involving the application of this equitable doctrine [in <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway</i>] must depend on its own particular circumstances. It is, of course, clear ... that there are some cases where the period of suspension clearly terminates on the happening of a certain event or the cessation of a previously existing state of affairs or on the lapse of a reasonable period thereafter. In such cases no intimation or notice of any kind may be necessary. But in other cases where there is nothing to fix the end of the period which may be dependent upon the will of the person who has given or made the concession, equity will no doubt require some notice or intimation together with a reasonable period for readjustment before the grantor is allowed to enforce his strict rights. No authority has been cited which binds your Lordships to hold that in all such cases the notice must take any particular form or specify a date for the termination of the suspensory period. This is not surprising having regard to the infinite variety of circumstances which may give rise to this principle which was stated in broad terms and must now be regarded as of general application. It should, I think, be applied with great caution to purely creditor and debtor relationships which involve no question of forfeiture or cancellation, and it would be unfortunate if the law were to introduce into this field technical requirements with regard to notice and the like which might tend to penalise or discourage the making of reasonable concessions”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;One further potential consequence of promissory estoppel which has not been mentioned so far relates to the situation in which notice of a resumption of rights is given, but the promisee has so altered his position in reliance on the promise as to be unable to resume the obligations of the contract. There is only one solution. If it would be inequitable to allow the resumption of rights in all the circumstances, then equity will extinguish them permanently. This is stated by Lord Hodson:</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He never did so. She had a right to apply to the Divorce Court for an order for maintenance but did not (in fact her income was larger than that of her husband). She sued for arrears of payment, arguing (inter alia) that she had given consideration for her husband&#8217;s promise to pay by promising not to apply to the court for a maintenance order. The judge at first instance (Byrne J) held that there was no consideration, but that the principle of promissory estoppel applied; the husband&#8217;s promise was intended to be acted upon and was in fact acted upon. The Court of Appeal held that this was not a case of promissory estoppel. Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> candidly observed that much as he was inclined to favour the principle stated in <i>High Trees</i>, it was important that it should not be stretched too far, lest it be endangered. It might be part of a cause of action, but it could not stand as a cause of action alone. Birkett LJ adopted the expression of counsel for the husband in these proceedings; promissory estoppel was “a shield, and not a sword”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The notion that promissory estoppel can be deployed as part of a cause of action, but not as a cause of action itself, may need some explanation. What is envisaged is that the claimant may base an action on some accepted cause, such as breach of contract, and defeat the other side&#8217;s defence to it, or their counterclaim, by pleading a promissory estoppel. The <i>Tool Metal </i>case (above) in the Court of Appeal is an example of this.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In certain other common law jurisdictions (notably the United States) promissory estoppel has outgrown this limitation. The best-known example is the following case, decided by the High Court of Australia.

Maher signed his part of the proposed lease, sent it to Waltons for exchange to take place, and began to demolish the building. Meanwhile, Waltons had second thoughts about the whole deal. They nevertheless waited until 40% of the demolition and construction work had been done, and then informed Maher that they were not going ahead. Maher sought a declaration, arguing that Waltons were estopped from breaking an implied promise to complete the lease agreement. The court held that this was correct. The conduct of Waltons amounted to a clear inducement to Maher to suffer detriment by acting on an assumption which Waltons knew to be incorrect, and as such, it was unconscionable. Waltons would be estopped from retreating from its implied promise to complete the contract. Alternatively (and still more radically) the court would apply estoppel to prevent Waltons from denying that a contract had come into existence.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Brennan J in the above case suggests that “…there is a logical difficulty in limiting the principle [of promissory estoppel] so that it applies only to promises to suspend or extinguish existing rights. If a promise by A not to enforce an existing right against B is to confer an equitable right on B to compel fulfilment of the promise, why should B be denied the same protection in similar circumstances if the promise is intended to create in B a new legal right against A? There is no logical distinction to be drawn between a change in legal relationships effected by a promise which extinguishes a right and a change in legal relationships effected by a promise which creates one. Why should an equity of the kind to which Combe v Combe refers be regarded as a shield but not a sword?”</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Brennan J is right, but there is a way of explaining why estoppel might normally be only a defence while in exceptional circumstances (though not yet in England) it might be used as an attack. Promissory estoppel, as an equitable doctrine, could be said to concern itself not only with the protection of B, the promise, but in a proper case also with the behaviour of A, and indeed the conscience of A. That follows from the origins of equity, and the facts of the present case demand this additional perspective; the behaviour of Waltons was unconscionable. It would not be an unreasonable state of affairs if equity normally afforded only a defence to protect B, but exceptionally went further to give B a cause of action to meet the additional element of A&#8217;s unconscionable conduct. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The driver was not insured for the purpose, and a claim was brought on behalf of the deceased against the Motor Insurers&#8217; Bureau. The question which determined the Board&#8217;s liability to pay was whether the vehicle was being used to carry passengers for reward. Although on the evidence the payment terms had been flexible, the majority of the House of Lords found that the arrangement went beyond a matter of social kindness even if it was not strictly contractual, and was sufficient to render the Board liable. Lord Cross, differing from the majority, held that a contract was necessary, and that it could be found at least in relation to completed journeys.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Cross explained his view as follows: “I think that the judge was wrong in holding that the facts which he found warranted the inference that there were no legally binding agreements between Mr Quirk and any of his passengers. It is not necessary in order that a legally binding contract should arise that the parties should direct their minds to the question and decide in favour of the creation of a legally binding relationship. If I get into a taxi and ask the driver to drive me to Victoria Station it is extremely unlikely that either of us directs his mind to the question whether we are entering into a contract. We enter into a contract not because we form any intention to enter into one but because if our minds were directed to the point we should as reasonable people both agree that we were in fact entering into one. When one passes from the field of transactions of an obviously business character between strangers to arrangements between friends or acquaintances for the payment by the passenger of a contribution towards expenses the fact that the arrangement is not made purely as a matter of business and that if the anticipated payment is not made it would probably never enter into the head of the driver to sue for it disposes one to say that there is no contract, but in fact the answer to the question “contract” or “no contract” does not depend on the likelihood of an action being brought to enforce it in case of default”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This being so, the question is upon what the finding of intention to create legal relations in fact depends. The dominant consideration in the leading case on the subject, <i>Balfour v Balfour</i>, seems to be the relationship between the parties. The proposition to be taken from it is that agreements between people in a domestic relationship are presumed not to be binding.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

She alleged that he made an agreement at this time to pay her £30 a month until she joined him in Ceylon. They later decided to live separately. The wife sued for the payments. The Court of Appeal held that there was no contract on which she could sue. It was not reasonable to maintain that the husband had made a binding promise which was to regulate his allowance to her whatever his or her circumstances.

Warrington LJ denied that Mrs Balfour made any response to her husband&#8217;s promise which would permit the Court to see the arrangement as a bargain. Duke LJ was doubtful whether a bare exchange of promises, when made between husband and wife, amounted to an enforceable contract.

It is quite common, and it is the natural and inevitable result of the relationship between husband and wife, that the two spouses should make arrangements between themselves – agreements such as are in dispute in this action – agreements for allowances, by which the husband agrees that he will pay to his wife a certain sum of money, per week, or per month, or per year, to cover either her own expenses or the necessary expenses of the household and of the children of the marriage, and in which the wife promises either expressly or impliedly to apply the allowance of the purpose for which it is given. To my mind those agreements, or many of them, do not result in contracts at all, and they do not result in contracts even though there may be what as between other parties would constitute consideration for the agreement. The consideration, as we know, may consist either in some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other. That is a well-known definition, and it constantly happens, I think, that such arrangements made between husband and wife are arrangements in which there are mutual promises, or in which there is consideration in form within the definition that I have mentioned. Nevertheless, they are not contracts, and they are not contracts because the parties did not intend that they should be attended by legal consequences. To my mind it would be of the worst possible example to hold that agreements such as this resulted in legal obligations which could be enforced in the courts....All I can say is that the small courts of this country would have to be multiplied one hundredfold if these arrangements were held to result in legal obligations. They are not sued upon, not because the parties are reluctant to enforce their legal rights when the agreement is broken, but because the parties, in the inception of the agreement, never intended that they should be sued upon. Agreements such as these are outside the realm of contracts altogether. The common law does not regulate the form of agreements between spouses. The consideration that really obtains for them is that natural love and affection which counts for so little in these cold courts. The terms may be repudiated, varied or renewed as performance proceeds or as disagreements develop, and the principles of the common law as to exoneration and discharge and accord and satisfaction are such as find no place in the domestic code”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;In his book <i>Contract Theory</i> Stephen Smith considers how it is to be explained on a principled level that a domestic agreement such as that of Mr and Mrs Balfour is presumed not to be enforceable:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“The most compelling justification, I suggest, is that the special value associated with such agreements would be diminished if they were legally enforceable. Let me explain. Domestic agreements are different from ordinary commercial agreements. Specifically, they are not bargains in the ordinary sense of the term; the parties do not enter them to gain personal advantage. Rather, domestic agreements are made in order to promote the parties&#8217; <i>shared</i> interests. This shared interest lies both in the subject matter of the agreement (children, housework, etc.) and in the goal of strengthening the relationship itself. Domestic agreements are therefore both expressive of, and a constitutive feature of, the parties&#8217; relationship. Making (and performing) such agreements is an integral part of what it means to be in a relationship, and part of the reason they are valuable.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The significance of this for the law is that legally enforcing domestic agreements will arguably diminish this aspect of their value....To the extent that the law provides an external reason, grounded in self-interest, for complying with the terms of a domestic agreement, such agreements may come to be viewed in a different way. It will become less clear that they are performed because this is part of what the relationship entails as opposed to reasons of self-interest. The argument concludes that to ensure that the character – and thus the special value – of domestic agreements remains intact, the law should normally refuse to give them legal backing”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where the relationship between the parties has broken down, this reasoning obviously has no application, as the next case shows.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He broke the second of these promises, and the wife successfully obtained a declaration that she was the sole beneficial owner of the property. The husband argued on appeal that there was no intention to create legal relations in an agreement made between spouses.

I do not think that those cases have any application here. The parties there were living together in amity. In such cases their domestic arrangements are ordinarily not intended to create legal relations. It is altogether different when the parties are not living in amity but are separated, or about to separate. They then bargain keenly. They do not rely on honourable understandings.

It may safely be presumed that they intend to create legal relations...”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;It may be wondered whether <i>Merritt v Merritt</i> is really a case in which the presumption against finding legal relations in the domestic context was rebutted. In reality the presumption did not apply, since the situation was not domestic; the parties were already at arm&#8217;s length. This understanding is already suggested by the last sentence in the passage from Lord Denning&#8217;s judgment quoted above; there is a positive presumption of legal relations here, not the rebuttal of the contrary presumption.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The inapplicability of the doctrine of <i>Balfour v Balfour</i> to cases of marital breakdown is not the only limit on its operation.

He asserted that it had arisen from work carried out by him in the form of gardening and redecorating. The House of Lords denied his claim, requiring an express agreement to underpin a change in the beneficial ownership of property. Lord <span class="bd">Diplock</span>, in the course of a dissenting speech, observed that the principle in <i>Balfour v Balfour</i> did not deprive arrangements between spouses of all legal effect.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Diplock: “Where the acquisition or improvement is made as a result of contributions in money or money&#8217;s worth by both spouses acting in concert the proprietary interests in the family asset resulting from their respective contributions depend upon their common intention as to what those interests should be.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I have used the neutral expression “acting in concert” because many of the ordinary domestic arrangements between man and wife do not possess the legal characteristics of a contract. So long as they are executory they do not give rise to any chose in action, for neither party intended that non-performance of their mutual promises should be the subject of sanctions in any court (see <i>Balfour v Balfour</i>). But this is relevant to non-performance only. If spouses do perform their mutual promises the fact that they could not have been compelled to do so while the promises were executory cannot deprive the acts done by them of all legal consequences upon proprietary rights; for these are within the field of the law of property rather than the law of contract. It would, in my view, be erroneous to extend the presumption accepted in <i>Balfour v Balfour</i> that mutual promises between man and wife in relation to their domestic arrangements are prima facie not intended by either to be legally enforceable to a presumption of common intention of both spouses that <i>no</i> legal consequences should flow from acts done by them in performance of mutual promises with respect to the acquisition, improvement or addition to real or personal property – for this would be to intend what is impossible in law”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Although Lord Diplock was in a minority in this case as far as the means by which a beneficial interest in the marital home might arise, his observation that the presumption against legal relations varies in force according to whether the arrangement is executory or executed cannot be controversial. It has already been seen that the same distinction has a major impact on the readiness of courts to uphold vague agreements. In the context again of legal relations, Stephen Hedley makes the point that much will depend on the reason for which the enforceability of an agreement is being considered (“Keeping Contract in its Place” (1985)): “Take a variation of the classic academic conundrum in this area: Jack and Jill agree to go out to dinner and to split the bill. By asking the academic question “Is there a contract?” we are immediately in the realm of the abstract. If, however, we approach the matter from a practical standpoint, we must know what claim is being made. If Jill is suing Jack because Jack has refused to go to dinner at all, the arguments against liability are compelling. Surely, Jack cannot be taken as giving an outright commitment to go to dinner – what if he is ill, or they cannot agree on a suitable restaurant? But imagine that the two already had their dinner, for convenience Jill pays the bill in full, but Jack subsequently refuses to pay his half. The perspective changes. It is no longer so obvious that the contract cannot be enforced.... Jack&#8217;s contention that there was no intention to form a binding contract is likely to receive little sympathy. Blanket statements in cases that there is no “intention to contract” on the facts before the court should therefore be treated with suspicion; it is vital to note whether this was being said in relation to an executed or an executory contract”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The broad principle that legal relations are presumed not to be intended in domestic settings naturally applies not only as between spouses or other cohabitees, but to other dealings between relatives, as the next case demonstrates.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In return, the daughter was to leave her job in Washington to read for the English Bar with a view to practising in Trinidad. The daughter did so. Later, the agreement was altered, in that Mrs Jones bought a house for her daughter and allowed her to live there without paying rent and to support herself by taking in paying lodgers. After six years of studies, the daughter had still not managed to pass her Bar exams (perhaps largely because she had a young son to look after). Relations between the two broke down, and Mrs Jones sought a possession order. Her daughter resisted it on the ground that she had a contractual right to continue living in the house. The County Court judge held in favour of the daughter. The Court of Appeal allowed Mrs Jones&#8217;s appeal. In the view of two members of the court there had never been an enforceable contract since the situation was a domestic one. It was vaguely expressed, and intended to be flexible. It was therefore deemed binding in honour only.

The plaintiffs were to leave their own home and move in with the defendants, sharing household expenses. In return, the defendants promised to leave their house to the plaintiffs. In reliance on the agreement, the plaintiffs sold their home and lent part of the proceeds to their daughter to enable her to buy a flat. The relationship between the two couples deteriorated; the plaintiffs moved out and brought an action for damages against the defendants. The court held that it was unrealistic for the defendants to argue that the agreement had given rise to no legal relations. The factor leading to this conclusion was the drastic and irreversible character of the plaintiffs&#8217; reliance on the agreement. In the circumstances both sides must have envisaged that a legal remedy would be available if the agreement were breached.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">This result in this case makes good sense, but it is worth wondering about the detail of how it is reached. Is it permissible to take account of a putative breach of contract to find the intention to create legal relations made out? Earlier, in connection with the judgment of Erle CJ in Shadwell v Shadwell, it was suggested that consideration should not have been found in contemplation of the detriment to which the plaintiff might be subjected were the promised payments to be withheld (a breach of contract). Can the two analyses be distinguished?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">They can. Consideration must be found in the agreement itself, or in its performance. Detriment occasioned by a subsequent breach of contract is not consideration; quite apart from the fact that it comes too late in point of time, it cannot conceivably have been requested by the promisor. The intention to create legal relations must also be located within a defined period of time. Clearly, the attitudes of the parties once performance of the contract has begun are not relevant. The relevant intention, whatever the reason for inferring it, must exist at the time the agreement is made. However, it may be found in the parties&#8217; expectation as to the future, and specifically, as to the future performance or non-performance of the agreement. The horizon of contemplation can include the possibility of breach and the harm which would arise in consequence of it were the parties to find themselves without legal remedy. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

She was helped by her lodger, the plaintiff. The plaintiff filled out the competition entry form in the defendant&#8217;s name, filling in the individual predictions made by each of the three. The entry fee and the cost of postage were shared between the three. At length one of their entries (the grand-daughter&#8217;s) won the competition, and the defendant received the prize of £750. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the one-third share that she claimed. Sellers J held that the plaintiff succeeded. The true basis of the arrangement between the parties had been that they would go shares if any of them won.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The judgment of Sellers J in this case does not contain very much discussion of principle. The best account of the ratio of the case is normally taken to be this passage: “I think there was a mutuality in the arrangement between the parties. It was not very formal, but certainly in effect it was agreed that every week the forecast should go in in the name of the defendant, and that if there was success, no matter who won, all should share equally. That seems to be the implication from or the interpretation of what was said, that this was in the nature of a very informal syndicate so that they should all get the benefit of success”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;As several commentators have observed, Sellers J&#8217;s reference to “mutuality” (clearly the key notion in his judgment) rather begs the question. It is difficult to analyse it other than in terms of consideration. The parties had struck a bargain. The problem is this; if that is enough to show that legal relations were intended, then consideration would seem to be all that is needed and the principle of intention to create legal relations obviously appears otiose.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it"><span class="bd">McKendrick</span> suggests that “the reasons for the rebuttal of the presumption [against legal relations]are probably to be found in the fact that the parties had acted in reliance upon the agreement in relation to the sharing of the expenses of entering into the competition and the agreement was not one made in connection with the running of the household (had the dispute been about whose turn it was to do the ironing, the court may well have concluded that there was no intention to create legal relations)”. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">With respect, this seems somewhat beside the point. The shared expense of entering the competition was a fairly trivial amount and, more importantly, Sellers J stated in terms that it was not a vital matter. In addition, it could be understood as part of the consideration moving between the parties in the same way that “mutuality” can be related to the giving of consideration (the exchange of promises to go shares). An agreement relating to the running of the household could be a matter of quite as much moment as participation in a newspaper competition which was unlikely to result in success. The factor probably driving Sellers J&#8217;s decision was the large sum of money at stake; was the law to allow the defendant to keep £500 when she had promised it to others?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">To find the legal justification for the decision, one should look again at “mutuality”. It does suggest an exchange of promises, but beyond that, it is quite an apt way of indicating the quality of a certain type of agreement. The parties are equally bound, for better or worse, whatever the future may hold. Mutuality can be understood as a proposition about the parties&#8217; relationship in time. No need for renegotiation or abandonment of the deal is anticipated. It does not need to have the flexibility that could reasonably be implied into an agreement about who is to do the ironing. It is meant to provide assurance, which is to say that it is meant to do the job of a contract.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Her pupillage was otherwise unfunded. To succeed, she needed to bring herself within the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, which required that she had a contract with the set of chambers, and that she was a “worker”. In answer to the first point, the defendants argued that there was no intention to create legal relations, and that no consideration moved from the claimant. The Court of Appeal dismissed those arguments, holding that the relationship between the claimant and the defendants was contractual. However, she was not a “worker” within the sense of the Act.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;In view of the subject-matter of this decision it seems justifiable to quote from the judgment of Lord <span class="bd">Bingham</span> LCJ at some length:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“21. Whether the parties intended to enter into legally binding relations is an issue to be determined objectively and not by enquiring into their respective states of mind. The context is all-important. From the defendants&#8217; point of view the written offer of pupillage to the claimant came at the end of a long, time-consuming and expensive process. It was also a process of great long-term consequence to them since, although barristers in practice are independent self-employed practitioners, it is of benefit to all, at every level, that chambers as a whole consist of talented and hardworking members, and the defendants, like other chambers, recruit most of their tenants from the pool of those recruited as pupils. So, quite apart from considerations of professional duty and the public interest, it is of direct practical consequence to chambers to attract and select the ablest pupils. That is why, in part at least, many chambers including the defendants&#8217; fund pupillages for a proportion of their pupils, sometimes very generously. From the pupil&#8217;s point of view, obtaining a pupillage in a flourishing set of chambers practising in the pupil&#8217;s chosen field is a step with potentially immense consequences, both professional and financial, in both the short and the long term. Obtaining a pupillage does not of course guarantee a tenancy, but it guarantees the pupil an opportunity to show his quality and thereby seek a tenancy. When, as the culmination of a long process of application, short-listing and interview an offer is formally made and formally accepted it would in our judgment be surprising to infer that the parties intended to bind themselves in honour only.<br>&emsp;&emsp;22. In arguing that there was no intent to create legal relations Mr Goudie QC for the defendants relied on the educational nature of the arrangement, suggesting that it lacked the characteristics of a commercial contract and involved no payment by the pupil. It was a voluntary and gratuitous offer by the chambers to provide education and training. He also relied on the doubt which, he said, existed as to who entered into the arrangement on the chambers&#8217; side. There was, he suggested, no need for a contract because the relationship was already regulated by the documents to which reference has been made above, and if chambers should resile from an undertaking to provide pupillage the pupil would have ample redress through the Bar disciplinary machinery, which would in practice preclude such dishonourable behaviour. The absence of written terms and conditions, he argued, pointed strongly against any intention to contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;23. Neither singularly nor cumulatively do we find these points in any way persuasive on the question of intent. It is true that the content of the arrangement was educational, but as already pointed out the practical implications of the arrangement for both parties were potentially very significant and, subject to the point on consideration discussed below, there is no reason why a binding contract cannot be made for the provision of education and training. Whereas once the arrangement of pupillage was a one-to-one engagement between pupil and pupil-master, that has ceased to be so, as evidenced by the responsibility imposed on and accepted by heads of chambers, by the procedure in practice adopted by chambers and by the management of pupillage as a chambers responsibility. The claimant was not interviewed, nor was the offer of pupillage made, by either of those who became her successive pupil masters, and when the offer was made and accepted she did not know who they would be. The regulatory materials governing pupillage (only a small part of which we have quoted) were impliedly incorporated by reference into the arrangement made between the parties, and to that extent the terms of the arrangement were recorded in writing; but the functions and obligations of the parties were so clearly specified in these materials that any detailed negotiation of terms and conditions to be recorded in a written agreement between the parties was rendered unnecessary. It is of course unlikely that any chambers, certainly any reputable chambers, having made an offer of pupillage which has been accepted, would resile from that arrangement without very good reason, but the existence of a disciplinary sanction does not in our view point against the existence of a contract. To our mind this arrangement had all the characteristics of a binding contract. It makes no difference that, if the pupil defaulted, the chambers would be most unlikely to sue; the same is true if an employer engages a junior employee under an employment contract which is undoubtedly binding, and the employee fails to turn up on the appointed day”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The document contained the following clause, described as the “Honourable Pledge Clause”: “This arrangement is not entered into, nor is this memorandum written, as a formal or legal agreement, and shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the law courts either of the United States or England, but it is only a definite expression and record of the purpose and intention of the three parties concerned to which they honourably pledge themselves with the fullest confidence, based on past business with each other, that it will be carried through by each of the three parties with mutual loyalty and friendly co-operation”. Some years later the defendant terminated the agreement without notice, and the plaintiff sued for breach of contract. The House of Lords held that the Clause was sufficient to prevent legal relations arising from the agreement of 1913, which was not contrary to public policy as an attempt to oust the jurisdiction of the courts. However, legal relations were created by the placing and acceptance of specific orders under the agreement from time to time.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;In the Court of Appeal, Scrutton LJ stated his understanding of the law as follows: “It is quite possible for parties to come to an agreement by accepting a proposal with the result that the agreement concluded does not give rise to legal relations. The reason of this is that the parties do not intend that their agreement shall give rise to legal relations. This intention may be implied from the subject-matter of the agreement, but it may also be expressed by the parties. In social and family relations such an intention is readily implied, while in business matters the opposite result would ordinarily follow. But I can see no reason why, even in business matters, the parties should not intend to rely on each other&#8217;s good faith and honour, and to exclude all idea of settling disputes by any outside intervention with the accompanying necessity of expressing themselves so precisely that outsiders may have no difficulty in understanding what they mean.

The defendants had refused to give a guarantee, but instead provided a “comfort letter”, stating “It is our policy to ensure that the business of Metals is at all times in a position to meet its liabilities to you under the above arrangements”. Metals went into liquidation, and the plaintiffs sought repayment of the loan from the defendants. The defendants denied any contractual liability. At first instance, Hirst J held that the comfort letter was “contractual in status”, applying the presumption of legal relations recognised in <i>Edwards v Skyways</i>. The Court of Appeal reversed this decision, distinguishing <i>Edwards v Skyways</i> on the ground that it involved a promise, whereas this case did not. The defendants had stated what their policy was. They had not promised what it would be in the future.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Ralph Gibson LJ explained the court&#8217;s view in these terms: “The comfort letter was drafted in terms which ... do not express any contractual promise and which are consistent with being no more than a representation of fact. If they are treated as no more than a representation of fact, they are in that meaning consistent with the comfort letter containing no more than the assumption of moral responsibility by the defendants in respect of the debts of Metals. There is nothing in the evidence to show that, as a matter of commercial probability or common sense, the parties must have intended paragraph 3 to be a contractual promise, which is not expressly stated, rather than a mere representation of fact, which is so stated”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In an Australian case (Banque Brussels Lambert SA v Australian National Industries Ltd (1989)) the decision above was bitterly criticised by Rogers CJ. He considered that Ralph Gibson LJ&#8217;s semantic exercise was “inimical to the effective administration of justice in commercial disputes”, and that this approach would render the courts irrelevant in the resolution of commercial disputes.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It is easy to feel some sympathy for Rogers CJ&#8217;s view. Even a strictly semantic approach would seem to raise the question whether there is not some element of futurity in a statement of policy which covers “all times”. Is this not as good as a promise, or does it mean that the policy can be changed overnight? The question, of course, is how the context requires the relevant clause to be read. <span class="bd">McKendrick</span> provides a helpful insight: “Given the significance of the letter of comfort to the parties we can be certain that the lawyers fought hard over its precise wording. The letter bears the hallmarks of a carefully drawn document. It sets out the current policy of the parent company but refrains from making any commitment as regards the future”. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

An oral contract had been made between Meredith and the other company, Triact, amounting to an agreement for the hire of heavy machinery, a driver, and the rate of hire to be paid. No other terms were included. At weekly intervals Meredith&#8217;s driver presented Triact with a time sheet detailing the hours he had worked, for Triact to check and sign. The time sheets included the words “all hire undertaken on [Contractors&#8217; Plant Association] rules, copies available on request”. The effect of these rules, if they were incorporated, would be to require Triact as hirer to indemnify Meredith in respect of loss caused to third parties.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that contract had not been varied by signature to incorporate the rules. The test was whether a timesheet would be regarded by a reasonable person as a document likely to contain contractual terms. It would not, being a merely administrative device for recording performance under a pre-existing contract.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

There is a little more to it than that, consisting of three fairly minor points. The first is that <i>Curtis v Chemical Cleaning</i> expressly recognises that even an innocent misrepresentation constitutes an exception to the <i>L&#8217;Estrange</i> rule (this was not entirely clear from <i>L&#8217;Estrange</i> itself). The second is that the creation of any false impression as to the existence or extent of an exclusion will fall within the ratio of this case. It does not have to amount to a misrepresentation in accordance with all the technicalities which govern that subject as ordinarily understood. The third is that Denning LJ&#8217;s handling of the clause is somewhat unorthodox. One would more naturally think that the clause is either effective or that it is not. The idea that it is effective but only to the represented extent resembles an estoppel.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

After they had been staying in the hotel for six months, valuables belonging to the plaintiff were stolen from the room. She sued the hotel for negligence in contract and in tort. By way of defence, the hotel denied negligence and, in the alternative, relied upon a notice on the door of the plaintiff&#8217;s room excluding liability for loss or theft of valuables.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the Court of Appeal, Singleton and <span class="bd">Denning LJ</span>J held the notice was not incorporated into the contract which had been made upon the plaintiff&#8217;s arrival at the hotel, since it could not have been seen by her until after the contract was concluded (Bucknill LJ did not consider this point).

The answer was that it might have been incorporated when the plaintiff and her husband made their second payment at the end of their first week&#8217;s stay. Singleton LJ rejected this possibility, however, since he was persuaded that a single contract for an indeterminate stay and periodic payments had been made on the couple&#8217;s arrival at the hotel, rather than a contract renewable at intervals.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Denning LJ helpfully summed up the ways in which one party could demonstrate the other&#8217;s assent to being bound by a stipulation. “The best way of proving it is by a written document signed by the party to be bound. Another way is by handing him before or at the time of the contract a written notice specifying its terms and making it clear to him that the contract is on those terms. A prominent public notice which is plain for all to see when he makes the contract or an express oral stipulation would, no doubt, have the same effect. But nothing short of one of these three ways will suffice”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The facts are now given in greater detail.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The plaintiff drove up to the entrance of a multi-storey car-park at which he had not left his car before. At the entrance was a notice which read “All cars parked at owner&#8217;s risk”. As he proceeded, a light changed from red to green, and a machine provided a ticket which the plaintiff took before driving on. The ticket stated that it was issued “subject to the conditions of issue as displayed on the premises”. The plaintiff later returned to pay the parking charge and to collect his car. At this point an accident occurred, partly as a result of the defendants&#8217; negligence, in which the plaintiff was badly injured. The defendants disclaimed responsibility by reference to a notice within the garage which purported to exempt them from liability for injury howsoever caused.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that the defendants were liable, since they had not done what would have been necessary fairly to bring the exempting stipulation to the plaintiff&#8217;s attention at the time the contract was made.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The notice displayed at the entrance to the car-park could not assist the defendants because it made no reference to personal injury to customers. The live question in the case was whether the wording on the ticket was sufficient to incorporate the notice displayed inside the car-park. The members of the Court gave two responses to this. One, favoured by <span class="bd">Denning LJ</span> and Sir Gordon Willmer, was that the contract had been concluded before the ticket was issued. Megaw LJ did not reject the analysis based on timing, but said that he would reserve a final view on the mechanics of contracting in this situation. In common with the other members of the Court, he held that the words on the ticket were in no way adequate as reasonable notice of the extremely broad and destructive exclusion posted within the car-park. He placed particular emphasis on the fact that the clause in this case was one which would have deprived the plaintiff of protection provided by statute (the Occupiers&#8217; Liability Act 1957).</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-m' id='box-227'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'></div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This case was cited earlier on the subject of contract formation. The Council let out deck chairs on a beach. The charge was displayed on a notice by a pile of deck chairs, together with the information that tickets could be obtained from an attendant. The plaintiff sat on a deck chair, which gave way and caused him injury. The Council sought to defend itself by reference to exclusionary words printed on the ticket available from the attendant.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that the words on the ticket were not incorporated, since the ticket was not a contractual document. The plaintiff would have been reasonably entitled to regard it as a mere receipt to show that he had paid, and to state how for how long he could use the chair. The court regarded the pile of deck chairs as the offer and the act of sitting down on one of them as the acceptance. The ticket came after the contract was concluded.<br>&emsp;&emsp;As a matter of strict principle, the timing point illustrated by the three preceding cases ought to be decisive. If a stipulation is made only after the contract is concluded, it would seem that it cannot be part of that contract unless it is later made so by the varying of the contract for good consideration. In reality, matters may not be quite so clear-cut, as the next case shows.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-228'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Incorporation of Terms - Incorporation By Notice - Contractual Nature of Document / Expectations of Parties</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The parties were in the same line of business – the hiring out of heavy earth-moving plant – and they had done business together on two previous occasions. The defendants, Ipswich, urgently required a crane. Their manager agreed hire and transport charges with the plaintiffs by telephone. The plaintiffs later sent on a printed form by post. This would normally have been signed by Ipswich, but on this occasion it was not. Meanwhile, the crane sank in marshy ground, and was recovered at substantial expense to the plaintiffs. On the basis of clauses in the printed form, the plaintiffs claimed to be indemnified by Ipswich against their outlay. Ipswich contended that the relevant clauses were not incorporated into the contract which had been made earlier by telephone.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that the indemnity clause was validly incorporated. The defendants knew that plant hire was carried out on conditions, and in fact both they and the plaintiffs used versions of the common form known as “the Contractors&#8217; Plant Association form” (as in <i>Grogan</i>&#8216;s case above). Responding to the defendants&#8217; urgent need, the plaintiffs had been entitled to assume that the contract was being made on the normal conditions, even if in the event that was only specified post-contractually.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The fact that the parties had done business in the past was not regarded as a vital aspect of this case, even though (as will be seen) it is actually an independent basis on which incorporation of stipulations may sometimes be proven. The crucial facts are that the parties were in the same line of business, knew on what terms that business was usually conducted, and that the urgency with which the defendants required the crane had displaced the usual formalities. Lord <span class="bd">Denning MR</span> cited a far-reaching test of application in this and various other contractual circumstances:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“As Lord Reid said in <i>McCutcheon v David MacBrayne Ltd</i> [below] quoting from the Scottish textbook <i>Gloag on Contract</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed (1929), p. 7: “The judicial task is not to discover the actual intentions of each party; it is to decide what each was reasonably entitled to assume from the attitude of the other”. It seems to me that, in view of the relationship between the parties, when the defendants requested this crane urgently and it was supplied at once – before the usual form was received – the plaintiffs were entitled to conclude that the defendants were accepting it on the terms of the plaintiff&#8217;s own printed conditions – which would follow in a day or two. It is just as if the plaintiffs had said “We will supply it on our usual conditions,” and the defendants said “Of course, that is quite understood””.<br>&emsp;&emsp;There is therefore a degree of flexibility in the rules regarding incorporation by notice, even on the point of timing which might have been thought to be clear-cut. Further aspects of that flexibility will be seen in due course. First, however, we must approach the heart of the subject. What actually constitutes “reasonable notice” of an unsigned stipulation?</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He paid the attendant 2d, and in return received a ticket. On the front of the ticket were written a number, opening hours, and the words “See back”. On the reverse there were various clauses, including one which limited the company&#8217;s liability for baggage left at the cloakroom to £10. The plaintiff&#8217;s bag was lost, and he claimed its value as £24 10s. The company relied on its limitation clause. At trial the judge directed the jury to consider whether the plaintiff had known of the special condition on which the bag was deposited; and (presumably if the answer to the first question were negative) whether he had been under any obligation to read or make himself aware of the condition. The jury returned negative answers to both questions. The judge directed judgment for the plaintiff.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that the second question had amounted to a misdirection, and ordered a new trial. The correct question was whether the company had done what was necessary to give reasonable notice of the clause.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Mellish LJ set out the grounds for his decision, and his account of the situation, as follows:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“The railway company, as it seems to me, must be entitled to make some assumptions respecting the person who deposits luggage with them: I think they are entitled to assume that he can read, and that he understands the English language, and that he pays such attention to what he is about as may be reasonably expected from a person in such a transaction as that of depositing luggage in a cloak-room. The railway company must, however, take mankind as they find them, and if what they do is sufficient to inform people in general that the ticket contains conditions, I think that a particular plaintiff ought not to be in a better position than other persons on account of his exceptional ignorance or stupidity or carelessness. But if what the railway company do is not sufficient to convey to the minds of people in general that the ticket contains conditions, then they have received goods on deposit without obtaining the consent of the persons depositing them to the conditions limiting their liability. I am of opinion, therefore, that the proper direction to leave to the jury in these cases is, that if the person receiving the ticket did not see or know that there was any writing on the ticket, he is not bound by the conditions; that if he knew that there was writing, and knew or believed that the writing contained conditions, then he is bound by the conditions; that if he knew that there was writing, but did not know or believe that the writing contained conditions, nevertheless he would be bound, if the delivering of the ticket to him in such a manner that he could see there was writing upon it, was, in the opinion of the jury, reasonable notice that the writing contained conditions”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The trial judge&#8217;s reference to the plaintiff&#8217;s putative obligation was beside the point and a misdirection, since the plaintiff was at perfect liberty to leave the ticket unread if he pleased.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The rhetoric in this judgment shows the strain of adapting norms derived from the formation of contracts between individuals to the impersonal mode which arose after the industrial revolution. That is not surprising, since a model formed from the bargaining towards agreement by individuals is having to adapt here to circumstances in which one side to the deal (the company) has no means of accommodating the other, while the customer has no means of influencing the company. The strain is apparent in the second sentence of the passage quoted above, which appears at its outset to announce a stricture upon the company, but turns out to be a general liberty to the company to suppose that it is contracting with generic man. Since this seems a long way from the ideal of agreement which has formed the English contractual jurisdiction, the judgment concludes with a placatory gesture towards the residual liberties of the individual (paraphrased above). The consumer is under no duty to read the writing, in the sense that he cannot be compelled to do so or criticised in law for his failure. He nevertheless takes the consequences of it.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The notion that the customer is not bound if he was unaware that there was writing on the ticket needs careful handling. It appears oddly favourable to the individual in the context of a judgment which otherwise aims to keep the trains running and the cloakrooms open on economically feasible terms. The circumstances of the case should be borne in mind. The plaintiff had admitted that he knew there was writing on the ticket, so Mellish LJ could afford to be indulgent – the issue was no longer in point.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Even in terms of contract formation and timing this case, like others of the same sort, is not unproblematic. One would naturally think of the customer&#8217;s request or at least his tendering of money as the offer, and the issue of the ticket as the company&#8217;s acceptance. On that view the incorporation of terms seems to come too late. In fact the ticket cases proceed on the basis that the issue of the ticket is an offer which the customer is free to accept or reject once he has had the opportunity to inform himself of the legal burden he is taking on. This, however, is make-believe, as Lord <span class="bd">Denning MR</span> candidly acknowledges in the Shoe Lane Parking case. There is no true “locus poenitentiae” here. With the issue of the ticket, the deal is done. Nevertheless, the logical objection based on the timings within the transaction yields to the superior practical interest of enabling service industry to run on its own terms.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The extent to which “reasonable notice” can be reduced to a fiction is notoriously shown by the next case.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The defendants denied liability by reference to a clause which exempted them from responsibility for injury to excursion ticket holders howsoever caused. The plaintiff, who could not read, had booked the excursion through her niece. The front of the ticket read “Excursion, For Conditions see back”. The back of the ticket referred to conditions to be found in the Company&#8217;s timetables, notices and excursion and other bills. The relevant clause was to be found in the timetable, of which there was one copy at the booking office. It cost 6d to buy.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The jury found that the company had not taken reasonable steps to bring the existence of the clause to the notice of the plaintiff, but the trial judge nevertheless entered judgment for the defendants. The Court of Appeal upheld the judge, holding that there had been no evidence on which the jury could have made their finding. The company had offered the excursion at a reduced price and on ascertainable terms.

It is that a company was able to insert a clause in the small print which enabled it to cause injury to its customers with impunity. That was eventually prevented by Parliament through the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 which would have rendered the clause in this case of no effect. We will look more closely at the Act before long, but the present focus is on the rules of incorporation rather than the validity of exclusion clauses as such.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They contacted the plaintiffs, who ran a library of photographic transparencies, to ask whether they had anything suitable. The plaintiffs sent 47 transparencies the same day, together with a delivery note containing conditions. The defendants telephoned the plaintiffs to say that one or two of the transparencies could be of interest. One of the clauses on the delivery note stated that all transparencies should be returned within 14 days of the date of delivery, and that a holding fee of £5 per transparency plus VAT would be charged for each day that a transparency was retained beyond the 14 day period. The defendants forgot that they had the transparencies, and returned them some 15 days late. The plaintiffs sent them an invoice for £3783.50, calculated in accordance with their clause.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal, overruling the judgment at first instance, held that the clause had not been incorporated into the contract. Although the clause was so unreasonable that it could perhaps be viewed as a disguised penalty (and therefore unenforceable), <span class="bd">Bingham LJ</span> was prepared to assume that it would have been valid if it had been fully and fairly drawn to the defendants&#8217; attention. However, insufficient had been done, given the clause&#8217;s unreasonable and punitive character.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Bingham LJ remarked that while English law had committed itself to no overriding principle of good faith, which here might have required actual notice of the clause to be given, it had nevertheless developed individual solutions to perceived problems of unfairness. In his Lordship&#8217;s judgment, the cases on sufficiency of notice were to be read in that context. He continued:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“On one level they are concerned with a question of pure contractual analysis, whether one party has done enough to give the other notice of the incorporation of a term in the contract. At another level they are concerned with a somewhat different question, whether it would in all the circumstances of the case be fair (or reasonable) to hold a party bound by any conditions or by a particular condition of an unusual and stringent nature”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;On a reading of the authorities, Bingham LJ found support for his view that the question of incorporation by notice went beyond merely technical analysis to the fairness of competing outcomes. On the facts of the instant case, he said that the clause would have been effectively incorporated if it had been of a usual sort. However, since (in his words) it imposed an inordinate liability for a venial period of delay it could not be said that sufficient notice had been given.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;With the worthy and predictable exception of Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> and his “red hand”, it seems that judges shy away from indicating exactly what would constitute reasonable notice in a given case, limiting themselves to confirming or denying that it has been provided. Closer examination does suggest at least two very broad guidelines. On average facts, the case of <i>Parker v South Eastern Railway</i> seems to equate reasonable notice simply with the clause in question being ascertainable from the contractual documents. On the facts of <i>Interfoto,</i> which the court clearly found repugnant, Dillon LJ observes that nothing had been done to <i>differentiate</i> the clause in question from the other eight on the delivery note (though perhaps this should be taken as the absolute minimum which might have been required). The test which <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> derives from the <i>Interfoto</i> case is that a particularly onerous or unusual clause must be shown to have been fairly and reasonably drawn to the other&#8217;s attention. Could this mean that the other&#8217;s actual knowledge and understanding of the clause must be shown? There does not appear to be a case which has required one party to obtain the other&#8217;s specific agreement to a clause as the condition of its enforceability. Presumably a clause requiring that degree of special handling would be one of such extreme effect as to fall foul of unfair contract terms legislation in any event.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The goods proved to be defective, and the defendants instructed their customers to return the goods, at very considerable expense, and deducted those costs from the price payable for the tubes. The plaintiffs disputed the deduction on the basis that their conditions of sale placed the cost of returning faulty goods on the buyers. These conditions had been referred to in an order confirmation note, which was clearly a contractual document.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the plaintiffs could not rely on their clause, but gave different reasons. The majority (Hirst and Waite LJJ) considered that the clause was an extremely onerous and unusual condition when judged in the context of the contract as a whole, which deprived the defendants of all the usual rights and protections of the Sale of Goods Act. It had not been validly incorporated. Hobhouse LJ agreed that the clause was ineffective as a result of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, but distinguished the <i>Interfoto</i> case. If a clause was not unusual (and he considered that this one was not, since it dealt with matters often the subject of contracts of sale), it would rarely be appropriate to take a point on incorporation. The proper solution was provided by the Act.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;“The problem in the present case arises from the fact that these clauses have been unreasonably drafted. As is almost inevitable in printed standard terms, they are not related to the particular circumstances of the case and, furthermore, they stipulate for a greater protection of the seller than is reasonable, or anyway is reasonable without some special justification. In my judgment, and this is where I part company with my Lords, it is necessary before excluding the incorporation of a clause <i>in limine</i> to consider the type of clause it is. Is it a clause of the type which you would expect to find in the printed conditions? If it is, then it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that a party will be able to say that it was not adequately brought to his notice by standard words of incorporation. If a party wishes to find out precisely how a clause of a normal sort has been worded, he should ask for the actual text of the clause. This case is not analogous to either of the two cases upon which the appellant founds. The <i>Interfoto</i> case involved an extortionate clause which did not relate directly to the expected rights and obligations of the parties. In the <i>Shoe Lane Parking</i> case, it related to personal injuries and the state of the premises and not to the subject matter of the car parking contract, which would, in the view of the Court of Appeal, have been concerned with damage to property.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In my judgment, it is desirable as a matter of principle to keep what was said in the <i>Interfoto </i>case within its proper bounds. A wide range of clauses are commonly incorporated into contracts by general words. If it is to be the policy of English law that in every case those clauses are to be gone through with, in effect, a toothcomb to see whether they were entirely usual and entirely desirable in the particular contract, then one is completely distorting the contractual relationship between the parties and the ordinary mechanisms of making contracts. It will introduce uncertainty into the law of contract”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;There is one further means of incorporating stipulations into contracts which should be added to <span class="bd">Denning LJ</span>&#8216;s list in <i>Olley v Marlborough Court</i>. If the parties have consistently dealt with each other in the past on the basis of contracts into which a certain stipulation has been incorporated, then it may be possible to conclude that a later deal not including that stipulation is to be understood as if the stipulation were nonetheless present.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Clearly, much will turn on the facts of individual cases. The most plausible situation for the application of the rule would be a case in which the omission of the stipulation seems to have a mere oversight.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It was carrying the plaintiff&#8217;s car, which was lost. The defendants relied on a clause in their conditions of carriage against the plaintiff&#8217;s action in negligence. The shipping of the car had been arranged by the plaintiff&#8217;s brother-in-law, Mr McSporran, as his agent. Although it was the defendants&#8217; usual practice to require customers to sign a risk note which incorporated the relevant conditions, Mr McSporran had not been asked to do so on this occasion. The plaintiff himself had shipped goods with the defendants on four previous occasions, and had always been required to sign the risk note. His agent similarly had previous experience of dealing with the defendants, and his evidence was that he had sometimes been required to sign the note and sometimes not.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held that the defendants could not rely on the clause, which had not been incorporated into the oral contract concluded on this occasion. There was not the consistency of dealing in the past which would justify an inference that the present contract was to be on similar terms.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The fact of past dealings between the parties on unvarying terms does appear to be an accepted means of incorporation, despite its omission from <span class="bd">Denning LJ</span>&#8216;s list. However, some caution is needed. In this case, Lord Reid referred to it as a means by which contractual conditions might be implied, and the implying of terms is not the same as their incorporation. He went on to state a test (the “officious bystander” test) which is well-known as belonging to the field of implied terms. Lord Devlin expressly went further in this direction, stating that the only means by which an unexpressed term can come into a contract is by implication.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Perhaps the matter can be tested by extending the usual rationale for incorporation into this area in order to see whether in theory it could have any application, and if so, what results. Across the fields of incorporation by signature, reasonable notice, and the peculiar facts of the British Crane Hire case (perhaps sui generis), the justification for incorporation seems to be a standard one; one party&#8217;s conduct or inaction in all the circumstances entitles the other to deduce assent to the stipulations which are to govern the contract. It is possible to imagine a past course of dealing which would give rise to this state of affairs. It would need to be such as to enable the one party to submit that the other “must have known” that the usual pattern of contracting on set terms was not meant to have been abandoned, and that the instant change could only plausibly be regarded as an oversight, or explained by the urgency of the situation. Whether the drawing of that inference is taken to lead to the incorporation or implication of a term, it is clear that the facts of McCutcheon v David MacBrayne did not permit it.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

One party asked the other if it were true that they were “bringing out a rubber company”. The response was positive. The next question was whether “it was all right”. The answer given was “We are bringing it out”. On the strength of that answer, the inquirer bought a large quantity of shares in the company. The shares were bought at the height of the boom, but soon dropped in value when it became clear that the company&#8217;s plantations were inadequate. An action was brought against the defendants for fraudulently representing that the company was a rubber company or, in the alternative, for breach of a warranty to the same effect.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The misrepresentation action failed at first instance. The House of Lords held that the question of breach of warranty should never have been put to the jury at all, since as a matter of law there was no evidence on which it could have been maintained.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Moulton: “... the attempts to make a person liable for an innocent misrepresentation have usually taken the form of attempts to extend the doctrine of warranty beyond its limits and to find that a warranty existed in cases where there was nothing more than an innocent misrepresentation. The present case is, in my opinion, an instance of this. But in respect of the question of the existence of a warranty the courts have had the advantage of an admirable enunciation of the true principle of law which was made in very early days by Holt CJ with respect to the contract of sale. He says: “An affirmation at the time of the sale is a warranty, provided it appears to be on evidence to be so intended”. So far as decisions are concerned, this has, on the whole, been consistently followed in the courts of common law. But from time to time there have been dicta inconsistent with it which have, unfortunately, found their way into textbooks and have given rise to confusion and uncertainty in this branch of the law....A still more serious deviation from the correct principle is to be found in a passage in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <i>De Lassalle v Guildford</i> [1901] 2 KB 215,221, which was cited to us in argument in the present case. In discussing the question whether a representation amounts to a warranty or not the judgment says: “In determining whether it was so intended, a decisive test is whether the vendor assumes to assert a fact of which the buyer is ignorant, or merely states an opinion or judgment upon a matter of which the vendor has no special knowledge, and on which the buyer may be expected also to have an opinion and to exercise his judgment”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;With all deference to the authority of the court that decided that case, the proposition which it thus formulates cannot be supported. It is clear that the court did not intend to depart from the law laid down by Holt CJ and cited above, for in the same judgment that dictum is referred to and accepted as a correct statement of the law. It is, therefore, evident that the use of the phrase “decisive test” cannot be defended. Otherwise it would be the duty of a judge to direct a jury that if a vendor states a fact of which the buyer is ignorant, they must, as a matter of law, find the existence of a warranty, whether or not the totality of the evidence shows that the parties intended the affirmation to form part of the contract; and this would be inconsistent with the law as laid down by Holt CJ. It may well be that the features referred to in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in that case may be criteria of value in guiding a jury in coming to a decision whether or not a warranty was intended, but they cannot be said to furnish decisive tests, because it cannot be said as a matter of law that the presence or absence of those features is conclusive of the intention of the parties. The intention of the parties can only be deduced from the totality of the evidence, and no secondary principles of such a kind can be universally true”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The next task must be to assess the subsidiary tests, bearing in mind Lord Moulton&#8217;s strictures. They are merely guides to discovering what the parties intended. That said, the first of them will often provide particularly direct insight.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The plaintiffs took the defendant&#8217;s old car, a Morris, in part exchange. The defendant stated that the car was a 1948 model, and produced the vehicle&#8217;s registration book as confirmation of that fact. It later transpired that the car had in fact been manufactured in 1939 (the outward appearance of that model not having changed between those dates). The plaintiffs sued for damages for breach of warranty on the basis that they had allowed the defendant £115 more for the car than they would have done had they known its true age.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held by a majority that the defendant&#8217;s statement of the age of the car was a representation, rather than a warranty. The plaintiffs knew that the defendant had no greater knowledge of the car&#8217;s date of manufacture than they had themselves. Morris LJ, dissenting, considered that the age of the car was a vitally important matter, and therefore a condition of the contract.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">Denning LJ</span> explained why he differed from the trial judge who had found that the statement of the car&#8217;s age was a term of the contract:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“He asked himself, “Was it fundamental to the contract?” He answered it by saying that it was fundamental.... By concentrating on whether it was fundamental, he seems to me to have missed the crucial point in the case which is whether it was a term of the contract at all.... The material distinction here is between a statement which is a term of the contract and a statement which is only an innocent misrepresentation. This distinction is best expressed by the ruling of Lord Holt: Was it intended as a warranty or not? using the word warranty there in its ordinary English meaning: because it gives the exact shade of meaning that is required. It is something to which a man must be taken to bind himself.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In applying Lord Holt&#8217;s test, however, some misunderstanding has arisen by the use of the word “intended”. It is sometimes supposed that the tribunal must look into the minds of the parties to see what they themselves intended. That is a mistake. Lord Moulton made it quite clear that “The intention of the parties can only be deduced from the totality of the evidence”. The question whether a warranty was intended depends on the conduct of the parties, on their words and behaviour, rather than on their thoughts. If an intelligent bystander would reasonably infer that a warranty was intended, that will suffice.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Turning now to the present case, much depends on the precise words that were used. If the seller says “I believe it is a 1948 Morris. Here is the registration book to prove it”, there is clearly no warranty. It is a statement of belief, not a contractual promise. But if the seller says “I guarantee that it is a 1948 Morris. This is borne out by the registration book, but you need not rely solely on that. I give you my own guarantee that it is”, there is clearly a warranty. The seller is making himself contractually responsible, even though the registration book is [read “may be”] wrong”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;There is a risk of ending up thoroughly confused by Lord Denning&#8217;s remarks above, even though (as so often) they are technically correct if not indeed penetrating. A restatement of his points, which may perhaps alleviate the confusion, follows. Intention, as the fundamental test for the distinction between representation and warranty, is to be understood in its objective sense, as always. The importance of the statement made is not a free-standing test which can be used as an alternative to the test of objective intention. Importance is relevant if it increases the likelihood that the parties should be taken to have intended a remedy in damages if the statement should prove untrue. Importance, in this sense, will often be more truly shown by the emphasis placed on the statement, rather than by an examination of its relation to the main object of the contract.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look </span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">On a separate point, it should be noted that Denning LJ admits elsewhere in his judgment that he is concerned to reach a right result on the facts of this case, and that the law regarding representation and warranties enables him to do it. The loss, on facts such as these, would ideally be borne by the fraudster who first faked the car&#8217;s registration documents. That person is not available. Since the remaining choice is between penalising the expert buyers, who could have made supplementary checks but did not, or the innocent seller who had no relevant expertise, Denning LJ has no hesitation which way to go. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

An apparently suitable car was found, and the defendant told the plaintiff that it had done only 20,000 miles since being fitted with a replacement engine and gearbox. This was the mileage shown by the speedometer. The defendant said that he had put this information forward as being true to the best of his belief, but that he had not warranted it so as to make it a term of the contract, nor had he represented it (a representation is a statement of fact). The trial judge found on the evidence that the statement as to mileage was false, and had amounted to a warranty.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal, including Lord <span class="bd">Denning MR</span>, distinguished <i>Oscar Chess</i> and dismissed the appeal. The statement as to mileage was indeed a term of the contract.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;“I endeavoured to explain in <i>Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams</i> [1957] 1 WLR 370 that the question whether a warranty was intended depends on the conduct of the parties, on their words and behaviour, rather than on their thoughts. If an intelligent bystander would reasonably infer that a warranty was intended, that will suffice. What conduct, then? What words or behaviour, lead to the inference of a warranty?<br>&emsp;&emsp;Looking at the cases once more, as we have done so often, it seems to me that if a representation is made in the course of dealings for a contract for the very purpose of inducing the other party to act on it, and actually inducing him to act upon it, by entering into the contract, that is prima facie ground for inferring that it was intended as a warranty... But the maker of the representation can rebut this inference if he can show that it really was an innocent misrepresentation, in that he was in fact innocent of fault in making it, and that it would not be reasonable in the circumstances for him to be bound by it. In the <i>Oscar Chess</i> case the inference was rebutted. There a man had bought a second-hand car and received with it a log-book, which stated the year of the car, 1948. He afterwards resold the car. When he resold it he simply repeated what was in the log-book and passed it on to the buyer. He honestly believed on reasonable grounds that it was true. He was completely innocent of any fault. There was no warranty by him but only an innocent misrepresentation. Whereas in the present case it is very different. The inference is not rebutted. Here we have a dealer, Smith, who was in a position to know, or at least to find out, the history of the car. He could have got it by writing to the makers. He did not do so. Indeed it was done later. When the history of this car was examined, his statement turned out to be quite wrong. He ought to have known better. There was no reasonable foundation for it”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This was not Lord Denning&#8217;s finest hour, unless one is happy to let matters rest on the footing that people in the trade should more generally be liable to pay contractual damages than those who are not. The references to fault seem entirely beside the point; the court was required to construe a contract, not to judge the defendant&#8217;s behaviour. Fault, or its absence, is not generally the most appropriate tool for contractual analysis, and there is little independent support in the case law for using it to detect the difference between the making of statements which are contractual terms and those which are extra-contractual representations.<br>&emsp;&emsp;What can one properly take from this well-known case? Perhaps only the following, which omits reference to fault. A statement will more readily be found to be a term of the contract if it is made by a person who, to the knowledge of both parties, is well-placed to guarantee its accuracy. Somebody who is in the trade, or an expert, or a person who could be presumed to have the means to have checked the facts, is so placed.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">There is a further difficulty lurking in these two cases. It needs to be recorded here simply because it is capable of leading to misunderstanding at a later stage. Lord Denning manoeuvres himself into equating representations with statements of belief, and warranties with inducements. Unfortunately a representation, strictly understood, is precisely not a statement of belief but one of fact. What is more, a representation must be an inducement to enter into a contract, so it is puzzling to find the fact of inducement used as to define a statement as going beyond a representation. Oscar Chess and Dick Bentley leave certain aspects of the law in a mess. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

There is no doubt that the plaintiff did make some attempt of the kind in order to protect himself from the risk of buying an animal that was not of the kind described.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The real question is: What did the parties understand by the question addressed to and the answer received from both the defendant and the auctioneer? It is contended by the defendant that the question meant “having regard to the onerous stipulations which I know I shall have to put up with if I bid and the lot is knocked down to me, can you give me your honourable assurance that the heifers have in fact not been served? If so, I will risk the penalties of the catalogue”. The alternative meaning is: “I am frightened of contracting on your published terms, but I will bid if you will tell me by word of mouth that you accept full responsibility for the statement in the catalogue that the heifers have not been served, or in other words, give me a clean warranty. That is the only condition on which I will bid”. If that was the meaning there was clearly an oral offer of a warranty which over-rode the stultifying condition in the printed terms, that offer was accepted by the plaintiff when he bid, and the contract was made on that basis when the lot was knocked down to him...”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">This case is in fact controversial, but for a subsidiary reason not directly related to the conflict between the exempting terms and the express assurance. Commentators have wondered whether it was legitimate for one bidder at auction to have the benefit of a private warranty while others did not, and have contrasted Couchman with a nineteenth century case which went the other way but was not cited to the court. It is not necessary to dwell on the problem, and in fact Couchman is overlain by more than one later statement of judicial approval.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The more substantial point is to gauge the means by which the oral assurance is found to take precedence over the potentially stultifying condition in the contract. The reasoning would seem to be this. The assurance comes later in time, and is therefore taken to represent the actual bargain between the parties. It is in this sense that it overrides.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The landlord did not object to his sleeping there. In 1947 a new lease was in the process of negotiation. It included covenants that the defendant would not sleep on the premises, apparently included to prevent the tenancy coming within the Rent Restriction Acts. In response to the defendant stating that he would not sign the lease with this covenant in it, the landlord&#8217;s agent told him that no objection would be made to his sleeping there. The lease was signed. In 1956 the plaintiffs sought forfeiture of the lease on the ground that the defendant was in breach of covenant by sleeping on the premises.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Harman J held that the promise not to object to the defendant sleeping on the premises, together with his entry into the lease, together constituted a collateral contract.

To meet the objection that there is a clear contract which the assurance is impermissibly attempting to contradict, it is possible to point to an independent process of contract formation which has produced a separate agreement. Furthermore, it will normally be possible to submit that since the main agreement would not have been concluded but for the collateral contract, so the main agreement must be read subject to the collateral one. Even if the main agreement were held to be unaffected by the collateral contract, it might be possible to claim damages for breach of the latter, as was successfully done in the next case.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In order to escape from that rule, the pleader used to allege – I often did it myself – that the misrepresentation was fraudulent, or alternatively a collateral warranty. We had to reckon, of course, with the dictum of Lord Moulton that such “collateral contracts must from their very nature be rare”. But more often than not the court elevated the innocent misrepresentation into a collateral warranty, and thereby did justice – in advance of the Misrepresentation Act 1967. I remember scores of cases of that kind, especially on the sale of a business. A representation as to the profits that had been made in the past was invariably held to be a warranty. Besides that experience, there have been many cases since I have sat in this court where we have readily held a representation – which induces a person to enter into a contract – to be a warranty sounding in damages.

It relied on an agreement under seal that he would not set up in the relevant area as a “provision merchant” for a specified time. It was therefore necessary to decide whether trading as a margarine manufacturer made the defendant a provision merchant. The Court of Appeal held, after considering evidence, that it did not.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Cozens-Hardy MR stated the accepted approach to the construction of documents: “If there is one principle more clearly established than another in English law it is surely this: It is for the court to construe a written document. It is irrelevant and improper to ask what the parties, prior to the execution of the instrument, intended or understood. What is the meaning of the language that they have used therein? That is the problem, and the only problem. In saying that, I do not mean to assert that no evidence can be admitted.... it is the duty of the court, which is presumed to understand the English language, to construe the document according to the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words used therein, and without reference to anything which has previously passed between the parties to it”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This approach to construction, sometimes known as the “four corners” doctrine, amounted to the view that everything that could properly be taken from a document would appear from its words alone, provided only that they were properly interpreted (which might require the meaning of some to be elucidated by objective evidence). Such an inward-looking perspective may seem all too appropriate to an elitist and isolated judiciary. It should be borne in mind, however, that it perhaps encouraged savings of time and expense in adjudication by limiting the preparation on which it would be based; that its confirmation of the supremacy of literal meaning promoted predictability; and that it had the strong backing in principle from the fact that the court had asserted its jurisdiction over the document subject to scrutiny. The court in a sense “owned” the document. Certainly it regarded itself as the owner of its meaning.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Nevertheless, this attitude underwent a modification. In <i>Prenn v Simmonds</i> [1971] 1 WLR Lord Wilberforce disclaimed the idea that agreements could be wholly isolated from the “matrix of fact” in which they were set.

When one speaks of the knowledge of the parties to the contract, one is speaking objectively – the parties cannot themselves give direct evidence of what their intention was – and what must be ascertained is what is to be taken as the intention which reasonable people would have if placed in the situation of the parties. Similarly when one is speaking of aim, or object, or commercial purpose, one is speaking objectively of what reasonable persons would have in mind in the situation of the parties...

The ICS was involved because the investors had assigned to it certain of their rights. The question was which rights had been assigned. The relevant form excluded from the assignment “any claim (whether sounding in rescission for undue influence or otherwise)”. The ICS and the investors understood these words differently, with the result that their claims against the building society overlapped.

The clause was badly drafted, and had to be read to mean “any claim sounding in rescission (whether for undue influence or otherwise). Lord Lloyd dissented on the ground that it was quite impermissible to take words from within the brackets and place them outside, thereby completely altering their sense.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span> was a member of the majority which considered it necessary to read the clause against its plain meaning. He took the opportunity to make a series of prefatory observations on the practice of construing contracts:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“My Lords ... I should preface my explanation of my reasons with some general remarks about the principles by which contractual documents are nowadays construed. I do not think that the fundamental change which has overtaken this branch of the law, particularly as a result of the speeches of Lord Wilberforce [in <i>Prenn v Simmonds</i> (1971) and <i>Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Hansen-Tangen</i> (1976)], is always sufficiently appreciated. The result has been, subject to one important exception, to assimilate the way in which such documents are interpreted by judges to the common sense principles by which any serious utterance would be interpreted in ordinary life. Almost all the old intellectual baggage of “legal” interpretation has been discarded. The principles may be summarised as follows.<br>&emsp;&emsp;[1] Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;[2] The background was famously referred to by Lord Wilberforce as the “matrix of fact”, but this phrase is, if anything, an understated description of what the background may include. Subject to the requirement that it should have been reasonably available to the parties and to the exception to be mentioned next, it includes absolutely anything which would have affected the way in which the language of the document would have been understood by a reasonable man.<br>&emsp;&emsp;[3] The law excludes from the admissible background the previous negotiations of the parties and their declarations of subjective intent. They are admissible only in an action for rectification. The law makes this distinction for reasons of practical policy and, in this respect only, legal interpretation differs from the way we would interpret utterances in ordinary life. The boundaries of this exception are in some respects unclear. But this is not the occasion on which to explore them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;[4] The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean. The background may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax (see <i>Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd</i> [1997] 2 WLR 945).<br>&emsp;&emsp;[5] The “rule” that words should be given their “natural and ordinary meaning” reflects the commonsense proposition that we do not easily accept that people have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents. On the other hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they plainly could not have had. Lord <span class="bd">Diplock</span> made this point more vigorously when he said in <i>Antaios Cia Naviera SA v Salen Rederiema AB, The Antaios</i> [1985] 191 at 201:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business common sense, it must be made to yield to business common sense”.”</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They were printed in small print on the back of tickets and order forms and invoices. They were contained in catalogues or timetables. They were held to be binding on any person who took them without objection. No one ever did object. He never read them or knew what was in them. No matter how unreasonable they were, he was bound. All this was done in the name of “freedom of contract”. But freedom was all on the side of the big concern which had the use of the printing press. No freedom for the little man who took the ticket or order form or invoice. The big concern said, “Take it or leave it”. The little man had no option but to take it. The big concern could and did exempt itself from liability in its own interest without regard to the little man. It got away with it time after time. When the courts said to the big concern, “You must put it in clear words”, the big concern had no hesitation in doing so. It knew well that the little man would never read the exemption clauses or understand them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Faced with this abuse of power – by the strong against the weak – by the use of the small print of the conditions – the judges did what they could to put a curb upon it. They still had before them the idol, “freedom of contract”. They still knelt down and worshipped it, but they concealed under their cloaks a secret weapon. They used it to stab the idol in the back. This weapon was called “the true construction of the contract”. They used it with great skill and ingenuity. They used it so as to depart from the natural meaning of the words of the exemption clause and to put upon them a strained and unnatural construction. In case after case, they said that the words were not strong enough to give the big concern exemption from liability; or that in the circumstances the big concern was not entitled to rely on the exemption clause. If a ship deviated from the contractual voyage, the owner could not rely on the exemption clause. If a warehouseman stored the goods in the wrong warehouse, he could not pray in aid the limitation clause. If the seller supplied goods different in kind from those contracted for, he could not rely on any exemption from liability. If a shipowner delivered goods to a person without production of the bill of lading, he could not escape liability by reference to an exemption clause. In short, whenever the wide words – in their natural meaning – would give rise to an unreasonable result, the judges either rejected them as repugnant to the main purpose of the contract, or else cut them down to size in order to produce a reasonable result.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> went on to recount how “out of winter came spring” with the legislative activity which led to the passing of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. In his view, it was no longer necessary to go through “all kinds of gymnastic contortions” to get around exclusion clauses, since the Act now subjected many of them to a test of reasonableness. Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> also considered that it should no longer be necessary to harass students with the study of cases on exclusion clauses. Nevertheless, the topic will be revisited (fairly briefly) in lecture 12.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Mr Naeem, who had earlier been made redundant by the bank, signed a release of all claims that he might have against it. The question for the House of Lords in this case was whether that agreement should be taken to extend to a claim not known to the law at the time (in 1998, a decision of the House of Lords introduced the concept of “stigma damages”, to which Mr Naeem was now arguably entitled). The majority of their lordships held that the agreement did not extend to stigma damages. Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span>n, dissenting, held that the draftsman of Mr Naeem&#8217;s general release agreement had “meant business” and was not leaving deliberate gaps. All claims were barred, whether known to the law at the time of the agreement or not.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Hoffmann deprecated the use of authority to solve this problem of construction:<br>&emsp;&emsp;50. “The main contrary argument which Mr Allen put before your Lordships was an argument based on authority. He referred the House to a number of cases, going back to the 18th century, from which he culled general statements much along the lines of those which I have already cited from <i>Directors of the London and South Western Railway Co v Blackmore,</i> LR 4 HL 610 and <i>Lyall v Edwards, </i>6 H &amp; N 337. From these he invited your Lordships to hold that there was a general presumption that, in the absence of what were described as &#8220;clear words to the contrary&#8221;, general words of release would be confined to matters which were within the specific contemplation of the parties. And he urged your Lordships to adopt this construction even in a case in which there were obviously no claims within the specific contemplation of the parties.<br>&emsp;&emsp;51. My Lords, I have a number of difficulties with this argument, the first of which goes to the root of the process of interpretation. If interpretation is the quest to discover what a reasonable man would have understood specific parties to have meant by the use of specific language in a specific situation at a specific time and place, how can that be affected by authority? How can the question of what a reasonable man in 1990 would have thought BCCI and Mr Naeem meant by using the language of an Acas form be answered by examining what Lord Keeper Henley said in 1758 (<i>Salkeld v Vernon,</i> 1 Eden 64)? I can understand that if parties in a legal context use words in what appears to have been a technical sense, it may be necessary to ascertain that technical meaning from authorities. But there is nothing of that kind here.<br>&emsp;&emsp;52. My second difficulty is that Mr Allen&#8217;s citations of authority were almost entirely context-free. He read a number of general statements of the kind which I have already cited without inviting your Lordships to examine in any detail the facts of the cases in which they were made. But that does not seem to me a proper use of authority. The remarks of judges, however general, have to be read in context no less than the general words of contractual documents”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

But pre-contractual negotiations seem to me capable of raising practical questions different from those created by other forms of background. Whereas the surrounding circumstances are, by definition, objective facts, which will usually be uncontroversial, statements in the course of pre-contractual negotiations will be drenched in subjectivity and may, if oral, be very much in dispute. It is often not easy to distinguish between those statements which (if they were made at all) merely reflect the aspirations of one or other of the parties and those which embody at least a provisional consensus which may throw light on the meaning of the contract which was eventually concluded. But the imprecision of the line between negotiation and provisional agreement is the very reason why in every case of dispute over interpretation, one or other of the parties is likely to require a court or arbitrator to take the course of negotiations into account. Your Lordships&#8217; experience in the analogous case of resort to statements in Hansard under the rule in Pepper v Hart [1993] AC 593 suggests that such evidence will be produced in any case in which there is the remotest chance that it may be accepted and that even these cases will be only the tip of a mountain of discarded but expensive investigation. Pepper v Hart has also encouraged ministers and others to make statements in the hope of influencing the construction which the courts will give to a statute and it is possible that negotiating parties will be encouraged to improve the bundle of correspondence with similar statements.<br>&emsp;&emsp;39. Supporters of the admissibility of pre-contractual negotiations draw attention to the fact that Continental legal systems seem to have little difficulty in taking them into account. Both the Unidroit Principles of International Commercial Contracts (1994 and 2004 revision) and the Principles of European Contract Law (1999) provide that in ascertaining the “common intention of the parties&#8221;, regard shall be had to prior negotiations: articles 4.3 and 5.102 respectively. The same is true of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980). But these instruments reflect the French philosophy of contractual interpretation, which is altogether different from that of English law. As Professor Catherine Valcke explains in an illuminating article (“On Comparing French and English Contract Law: Insights from Social Contract Theory”) (16 January 2009), French law regards the intentions of the parties as a pure question of subjective fact, their volonté psychologique, uninfluenced by any rules of law. It follows that any evidence of what they said or did, whether to each other or to third parties, may be relevant to establishing what their intentions actually were. There is in French law a sharp distinction between the ascertainment of their intentions and the application of legal rules which may, in the interests of fairness to other parties or otherwise, limit the extent to which those intentions are given effect. English law, on the other hand, mixes up the ascertainment of intention with the rules of law by depersonalising the contracting parties and asking, not what their intentions actually were, but what a reasonable outside observer would have taken them to be. One cannot in my opinion simply transpose rules based on one philosophy of contractual interpretation to another, or assume that the practical effect of admitting such evidence under the English system of civil procedure will be the same as that under a Continental system”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The decision stands as authority for an exception to the parol evidence rule (see the last lecture), namely that oral evidence may be admitted to show that a contract should be construed in accordance with local custom.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;What is the court doing here? In a sense, it is implying into this contract the term that “1000 rabbits”, in a contract made in the 1830s in Suffolk, has the meaning “1200 rabbits”. Local custom requires this implication. However, the court is equally interpreting the parties&#8217; contract contextually, taking into account the matrix of fact in order to discover the meaning which the parties must be deemed to have intended their contract to bear. There does not seem to be any way of preferring either one of these analyses over the other. They are different approaches to a single proposition. Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span>n, and the others who have agreed with him or indeed pointed the way to this perception, would appear to have a point. The internal organisation of some contract textbooks may need to be reconsidered.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It is wrong to say “there is a relevant custom – it applies unless, when we turn to the contract, we find words which exclude it”. The correct approach is that the construction of the contract comes first, and will answer the question whether the parties have or have not contracted by reference to local custom. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">This is a fairly minor point in the present context, but nevertheless one worth remembering.

For example, does the existence of various practices tending in the same direction strengthen the submission that a certain custom exists? No, this state of affairs tends to undermine it, by showing that practice is still in a state of flux. Can custom stand against a House of Lords decision tending against it? It depends how long ago the decision was made, and by reference to which facts. If there have been more recent developments in the relevant field of activity, it may be that the authority in question could now be distinguished on its facts. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

No charge was made for the mooring, but the plaintiff was to pay for use of the cargo handling facilities. It was obvious to both parties that the vessel would take the ground at low water. When this occurred, the vessel was damaged, since there proved to be a ridge of hard ground which caused her weight to be unevenly distributed. The defendants were not the owners of the river bed, and had no control over it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The trial judge found that the defendants had given no warranty or representation as to the state of the river bed, but had impliedly represented that they had taken reasonable care to ascertain if it was safe. The Court of Appeal put the same implication in the form of a term rather than a representation. It was necessary in order to give such business efficacy to the contract as the parties, as reasonable business men, must have intended it to have. The plaintiff could have known nothing about the state of the river bed, while the defendant wharfingers, with little trouble, might know everything. In the absence of the implied term, the plaintiff would merely have been buying the opportunity to put his vessel at risk.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The key concept in this case is “business efficacy” – a presumption that the parties, as reasonable people in business, must be taken to have intended their contract to work, rather than to fail through amounting to an absurdity. This necessity enables the court to imply a term to which the parties could not but have agreed as reasonable people had it been put to them.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">As is often remarked of The Moorcock, it is not altogether easy to see how the implication made on the facts fits with the doctrine of business efficacy. The term implied here by the court was obviously intended to produce a reasonable allocation of risk, but there is no general rule that business can only be done on the basis that risk has been allocated in a reasonable way between the parties. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Perhaps the best explanation of this state of affairs in connection with The Moorcock is the following. Some intervention by the court was indeed justified on the basis of necessity, because it was unthinkable that a matter as vital as the safety of the berth could be regarded indifferently by reasonable people. The necessity established, the court then implies a term which is reasonable; the wharfingers cannot be taken to be warranting something over which they do not have direct control, but they may be taken to warrant that they have found out the facts, and that if the facts had disclosed a hazard to the ship they would have warned the plaintiff. In other words, the process is a two-stage one. Necessity establishes the power of the court to intervene, but reasonableness dictates the manner of its intervention.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">A crucial point, namely that the court will not imply a term merely because it considers it reasonable to do so, is brought out by the next case.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The parties had in fact specified two grounds in their contract on which the agency would terminate (death of the agent, or by a period of notice).<br>&emsp;&emsp;Scrutton LJ refused to imply a term, observing that had it been put to the parties they would probably have disagreed about it, and that they had contractually recorded the extent of their agreement. He stated the correct approach as follows:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“The first thing is to see what the parties have expressed in the contract; and then an implied term is not to be added merely because the court thinks that it would have been reasonable to have inserted it in the contract. A term can only be implied if it is necessary in the business sense to give efficacy to the contract; that is, if it is such a term that it can confidently be said that if at the time the contract was being negotiated someone had said to the parties, “What will happen in such a case?” they would have both replied: “Of course, so and so will happen; we did not trouble to say that; it is too clear”. Unless the court comes to some such conclusion as that, it ought not to imply a term which the parties themselves have not expressed”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Scrutton LJ&#8217;s test was famously formulated (and successfully applied) in the next case, becoming known as the “officious bystander test”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

His contract stated that he was to hold this post for 10 years. During his tenure of it, Southern Foundries was taken over by another company, which altered its articles to permit two directors and the secretary to dismiss Mr Shirlaw. They did so. He sued for damages, and obtained them at first instance.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal, by a majority, dismissed an appeal against the award.

Before putting his decision on that basis, MacKinnon LJ had this to say about the implication of terms in fact:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“I recognize that the right or duty of a Court to find the existence of an implied term or implied terms in a written contract is a matter to be exercised with care; and a Court is too often invited to do so upon vague and uncertain grounds. Too often also such an invitation is backed by the citation of a sentence or two from the judgment of Bowen LJ in <i>The Moorcock</i>. They are sentences from an extempore judgment as sound and sensible as all the utterances of that great judge; but I fancy that he would have been rather surprised if he could have foreseen that these general remarks of his would come to be a favourite citation of a supposed principle of law, and I even think that he might sympathize with the occasional impatience of his successors when <i>The Moorcock</i> is so often flushed for them in that guise.<br>&emsp;&emsp;For my part, I think that there is a test that may be at least as useful as such generalities. If I may quote from an essay which I wrote some years ago, I then said: &#8220;Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common &#8216;Oh, of course!&#8217;&#8221;<br>&emsp;&emsp;At least it is true, I think, that, if a term were never implied by a judge unless it could pass that test, he could not be held to be wrong”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">A minor point - you will notice from the last sentence of the passage cited above that “being wrong” is on MacKinnon LJ&#8217;s mind, and in fact his reasoning on the facts of the case did not fare well in the House of Lords. It is a bold and somewhat risky step for a judge to introduce a term into a contract. The stating of the test in stringent terms, as is explicitly done above, provides some protection against the risk of successful appeal; the higher court may well note with approval that the test is stringent and therefore legally correct and then, even though it feels some doubt about the facts, defer to the lower court which has heard the evidence. In other words, there may be an element of gamesmanship in the wording of the officious bystander test. The actual application of the test may be less strict than the test itself suggests</i>.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In the next case, these tests are reviewed and explained.

	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-t' id='box-286'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Interpretation of Contracts - Coalescence of Contractual Interpretation and Implication of Terms In Fact</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The facts are complex, but can be given briefly by way of context. A situation arose, during the privatisation and later re-organisations of the Belize telecommunications service, in which two “special” directors sat on the board of Belize Telecom. The power to appoint them had belonged to the holder of a certain quantity and class of shares in the company. The holder of the relevant shares also had the power to dismiss them. However, no such entity now had the requisite share-holding. The question was whether the company&#8217;s articles of association (which gave no express answer to the problem) should be construed to allow for termination of the directors&#8217; tenure of office once the special shareholding had ceased to exist.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span>n, giving the opinion of the Privy Council, considered that this implication was correct. <a name="para32">The implication was required to avoid defeating what appeared to have been the overriding purpose of the machinery of appointment and removal of directors, namely to ensure that the board reflected the appropriate shareholder interests in accordance with the scheme laid out in the articles.</a</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Hoffmann explained his view of the relationship between the interpretation of contracts and the implication of terms from the presumed intention of the parties. They were one and the same process, based on the court&#8217;s objective construction of what the parties must be deemed to have meant.<br>&emsp;&emsp;16. “Before discussing in greater detail the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, the Board will make some general observations about the process of implication. The court has no power to improve upon the instrument which it is called upon to construe, whether it be a contract, a statute or articles of association. It cannot introduce terms to make it fairer or more reasonable. It is concerned only to discover what the instrument means. However, that meaning is not necessarily or always what the authors or parties to the document would have intended. It is the meaning which the instrument would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably be available to the audience to whom the instrument is addressed: see <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investors<span class=&#8220;it">Compensation</span>Scheme<span class="it">Ltd</span>v<span class="it">West</span>Bromwich<span class="it">Building</span>Society&#8221; title="Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society">Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society</a></i> [1998] 1 WLR 896, 912-913. It is this objective meaning which is conventionally called the intention of the parties, or the intention of Parliament, or the intention of whatever person or body was or is deemed to have been the author of the instrument.<br>&emsp;&emsp;17. The question of implication arises when the instrument does not expressly provide for what is to happen when some event occurs. The most usual inference in such a case is that nothing is to happen. If the parties had intended something to happen, the instrument would have said so. Otherwise, the express provisions of the instrument are to continue to operate undisturbed. If the event has caused loss to one or other of the parties, the loss lies where it falls.<br>&emsp;&emsp;18. In some cases, however, the reasonable addressee would understand the instrument to mean something else. He would consider that the only meaning consistent with the other provisions of the instrument, read against the relevant background, is that something is to happen. The event in question is to affect the rights of the parties. The instrument may not have expressly said so, but this is what it must mean. In such a case, it is said that the court implies a term as to what will happen if the event in question occurs. But the implication of the term is not an addition to the instrument. It only spells out what the instrument means.<br>&emsp;&emsp;19. The proposition that the implication of a term is an exercise in the construction of the instrument as a whole is not only a matter of logic (since a court has no power to alter what the instrument means) but also well supported by authority. In <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trollope<span class=&#8220;it">%26</span>Colls<span class="it">Ltd</span>v<span class="it">North</span>West<span class="it">Metropolitan</span>Regional<span class="it">Hospital</span>Board&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1&#8221; title="Trollope &amp; Colls Ltd v North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board (page does not exist)&#8220;>Trollope &amp; Colls Ltd v North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board</a></i> [1973] 1 WLR 601, 609 Lord Pearson, with whom Lord Guest and Lord <span class=&#8220;bd">Diplock</span> agreed, said:<br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8221;[T]he court does not make a contract for the parties. The court will not even improve the contract which the parties have made for themselves, however desirable the improvement might be. The court&#8217;s function is to interpret and apply the contract which the parties have made for themselves. If the express terms are perfectly clear and free from ambiguity, there is no choice to be made between different possible meanings: the clear terms must be applied even if the court thinks some other terms would have been more suitable. An unexpressed term can be implied if and only if the court finds that the parties must have intended that term to form part of their contract: it is not enough for the court to find that such a term would have been adopted by the parties as reasonable men if it had been suggested to them: it must have been a term that went without saying, a term necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, a term which, though tacit, formed part of the contract which the parties made for themselves.&#8221;<br>&emsp;&emsp;20. More recently, in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equitable<span class=&#8220;it">Life</span>Assurance<span class="it">Society</span>v<span class="it">Hyman&#8221; title="Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman">Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman</a></i> [2002] 1 AC 408, 459, Lord <span class="bd">Steyn</span> said:<br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8221;If a term is to be implied, it could only be a term implied from the language of [the instrument] read in its commercial setting.&#8221;<br>&emsp;&emsp;21. It follows that in every case in which it is said that some provision ought to be implied in an instrument, the question for the court is whether such a provision would spell out in express words what the instrument, read against the relevant background, would reasonably be understood to mean. It will be noticed from Lord Pearson&#8217;s speech that this question can be reformulated in various ways which a court may find helpful in providing an answer – the implied term must &#8220;go without saying&#8221;, it must be &#8220;necessary to give business efficacy to the contract&#8221; and so on – but these are not in the Board&#8217;s opinion to be treated as different or additional tests. There is only one question: is that what the instrument, read as a whole against the relevant background, would reasonably be understood to mean?<br>&emsp;&emsp;22. There are dangers in treating these alternative formulations of the question as if they had a life of their own. Take, for example, the question of whether the implied term is &#8220;necessary to give business efficacy&#8221; to the contract. That formulation serves to underline two important points. The first, conveyed by the use of the word &#8220;business&#8221;, is that in considering what the instrument would have meant to a reasonable person who had knowledge of the relevant background, one assumes the notional reader will take into account the practical consequences of deciding that it means one thing or the other. In the case of an instrument such as a commercial contract, he will consider whether a different construction would frustrate the apparent business purpose of the parties. That was the basis upon which <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equitable<span class=&#8220;it">Life</span>Assurance<span class="it">Society</span>v<span class="it">Hyman&#8221; title="Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman">Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman</a></i> [2002] 1 AC 408 was decided. The second, conveyed by the use of the word &#8220;necessary&#8221;, is that it is not enough for a court to consider that the implied term expresses what it would have been reasonable for the parties to agree to. It must be satisfied that it is what the contract actually means.<br>&emsp;&emsp;23. The danger lies, however, in detaching the phrase &#8220;necessary to give business efficacy&#8221; from the basic process of construction of the instrument. It is frequently the case that a contract may work perfectly well in the sense that both parties can perform their express obligations, but the consequences would contradict what a reasonable person would understand the contract to mean. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord<span class=&#8220;it">Steyn&#8221; title="Lord Steyn">Lord Steyn</a> made this point in the <i>Equitable Life case</i> (at p 459) when he said that in that case an implication was necessary &#8220;to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties.&#8221;<br>&emsp;&emsp;24. The same point had been made many years earlier by Bowen LJ in his well known formulation in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The<span class=&#8220;it">Moorcock&#8221; title="The Moorcock">The Moorcock</a></i> (1889) 14 PD 64, 68:<br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8221;In business transactions such as this, what the law desires to effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the transaction as must have been intended at all events by both parties who are business men&#8221;<br>&emsp;&emsp;25. Likewise, the requirement that the implied term must &#8220;go without saying&#8221; is no more than another way of saying that, although the instrument does not expressly say so, that is what a reasonable person would understand it to mean. Any attempt to make more of this requirement runs the risk of diverting attention from the objectivity which informs the whole process of construction into speculation about what the actual parties to the contract or authors (or supposed authors) of the instrument would have thought about the proposed implication. The imaginary conversation with an officious bystander in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirlaw<span class=&#8220;it">v</span>Southern<span class="it">Foundries</span>(1926)<span class="it">Ltd&#8221; title="Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd">Shirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd</a></i> [1939] 2 KB 206, 227 is celebrated throughout the common law world. Like the phrase &#8220;necessary to give business efficacy&#8221;, it vividly emphasises the need for the court to be satisfied that the proposed implication spells out what the contact would reasonably be understood to mean. But it carries the danger of barren argument over how the actual parties would have reacted to the proposed amendment. That, in the Board&#8217;s opinion, is irrelevant. Likewise, it is not necessary that the need for the implied term should be obvious in the sense of being immediately apparent, even upon a superficial consideration of the terms of the contract and the relevant background. The need for an implied term not infrequently arises when the draftsman of a complicated instrument has omitted to make express provision for some event because he has not fully thought through the contingencies which might arise, even though it is obvious after a careful consideration of the express terms and the background that only one answer would be consistent with the rest of the instrument. In such circumstances, the fact that the actual parties might have said to the officious bystander &#8220;Could you please explain that again?&#8221; does not matter.<br>&emsp;&emsp;26. In <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BP<span class=&#8220;it">Refinery</span>(Westernport)<span class="it">Pty</span>Ltd<span class="it">v</span>Shire<span class="it">of</span>Hastings&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1&#8221; title="BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (page does not exist)&#8220;>BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings</a></i> (1977) 180 CLR 266, 282-283 Lord Simon of Glaisdale, giving the advice of the majority of the Board, said that it was &#8220;not... necessary to review exhaustively the authorities on the implication of a term in a contract" but that the following conditions (&#8220;which may overlap&#8221;) must be satisfied:<br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8221;(1) it must be reasonable and equitable; (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective without it; (3) it must be so obvious that &#8216;it goes without saying&#8217; (4) it must be capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any express term of the contract&#8221;.<br>&emsp;&emsp;27. The Board considers that this list is best regarded, not as series of independent tests which must each be surmounted, but rather as a collection of different ways in which judges have tried to express the central idea that the proposed implied term must spell out what the contract actually means, or in which they have explained why they did not think that it did so. The Board has already discussed the significance of &#8220;necessary to give business efficacy&#8221; and &#8220;goes without saying&#8221;. As for the other formulations, the fact that the proposed implied term would be inequitable or unreasonable, or contradict what the parties have expressly said, or is incapable of clear expression, are all good reasons for saying that a reasonable man would not have understood that to be what the instrument meant”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The defendants were tenants of flats within it. There was no complete tenancy agreement between the parties, but merely a document headed “Conditions of Tenancy” which consisted of a list of obligations placed upon the tenants. The landlord had no express obligations. The block had been subject to vandalism, neglect by the landlords, and a lack of co-operation from the tenants. As a result, the lifts frequently did not work, the stairs were unlit, the rubbish chutes were blocked, and the lavatory cisterns overflowed. Following a rent strike, the council took proceedings against the tenants for possession of the flats. They counterclaimed for damages and an injunction to require the council to maintain the block properly.<br>&emsp;&emsp;At first instance the possession order was granted, but the defendants received £10 damages on their counterclaim since the council was held to be in breach of implied and statutory covenants. The Court of Appeal reversed the first instance judgment on the ground that the council was not in breach of covenant. The House of Lords accepted that the council was in breach of implied covenants to do what was reasonable to keep the block repaired and lit.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The following extract from the speech of Lord Wilberforce is a substantial one, so that the development of his reasoning can be seen.<br>&emsp;&emsp;“At the end there is a form for signature by the tenant stating that he accepts the tenancy.<br<br>&emsp;&emsp;On the landlords&#8217; side there is nothing, no signature, no demise, no covenant: the contract takes effect as soon as the tenants sign the form and are let into possession.<br>&emsp;&emsp;We have then a contract which is partly, but not wholly, stated in writing. In order to complete it, in particular to give it a bilateral character, it is necessary to take account of the actions of the parties and the circumstances. As actions of the parties, we must note the granting of possession by the landlords and reservation by them of the &#8220;common parts &#8220; stairs, lifts, chutes, etc. As circumstances we must include the nature of the premises, viz., a maisonette for family use on the ninth floor of a high block, one which is occupied by a large number of other tenants, all using the common parts and dependent upon them, none of them having any expressed obligation to maintain or repair them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="<span class=&#8220;it">Hlk157677335&#8221;></a>To say that the construction of a complete contract out of these elements involves a process of &#8220;implication&#8221; may be correct: it would be so if implication means the supplying of what is not expressed. But there are varieties of implications which the courts think fit to make and they do not necessarily involve the same process. Where there is, on the face of it, a complete, bilateral contract, the courts are sometimes willing to add terms to it, as implied terms: this is very common in mercantile contracts where there is an established usage: in that case the courts are spelling out what both parties know and would, if asked, unhesitatingly agree to be part of the bargain. In other cases, where there is an apparently complete bargain, the courts are willing to add a term on the ground that without it the contract will not work—this is the case, if not of <i>The Moorcock </i>itself on its facts, at least of the doctrine of <i>The Moorcock </i>as usually applied. This is, as was pointed out by the majority in the Court of Appeal, a strict test—though the degree of strictness seems to vary with the current legal trend, and I think that they were right not to accept it as applicable here. There is a third<br<br>&emsp;&emsp;variety of implication, that which I think Lord <span class="bd">Denning MR</span> favours, or at least did favour in this case, and that is the implication of reasonable terms. But though I agree with many of his instances, which in fact fall under one or other of the preceding heads, I cannot go so far as to endorse his principle: indeed, it seems to me, with respect, to extend a long, and undesirable, way beyond sound authority.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The present case, in my opinion, represents a fourth category, or I would rather say a fourth shade on a continuous spectrum. The court here is simply concerned to establish what the contract is, the parties not having themselves fully stated the terms. In this sense the court is searching for what must be implied.<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="<span class=&#8220;it">Hlk157678412&#8221;></a>What then should this contract be held to be? There must first be implied a letting, i.e., a grant of the right of exclusive possession to the tenants. With this there must, I would suppose, be implied a covenant for quiet enjoyment, as a necessary incident of the letting. The difficulty begins when we consider the common parts. We start with the fact that the demise is useless unless access is obtained by the staircase: we can add that, having regard to the height of the block, and the family nature of the dwellings, the demise would be useless without a lift service: we can continue that there being rubbish chutes built in to the structures and no other means of disposing of light rubbish there must be a right to use the chutes. The question to be answered—and it is the only question in this case—is what is to be the legal<br<br>&emsp;&emsp;There can be no doubt that there must be implied (i) an easement for the tenants and their licensees to use the stairs, (ii) a right in the nature of an easement to use the lifts, (iii) an easement to use the rubbish chutes.<br>&emsp;&emsp;But are these easements to be accompanied by any obligation upon the landlord, and what obligation? There seem to be two alternatives. The first, for which the council contends, is for an easement coupled with no legal obligation, except such as may arise under the Occupiers&#8217; Liability Act 1957 as regards the safety of those using the facilities, and possibly such other liability as might exist under the ordinary law of tort. The alternative<br<br>&emsp;&emsp;s for easements coupled with some obligation on the part of the landlords as regards the maintenance of the subject of them, so that they are available for use.<br>&emsp;&emsp;My Lords, in order to be able to choose between these, it is necessary to define what test is to be applied, and I do not find this difficult. In my opinion such obligation should be read into the contract as the nature of the contract itself implicitly requires, no more, no less: a test in other words of necessity. The relationship accepted by the Corporation is that of landlord and tenant: the tenant accepts obligations accordingly, in relation <i>inter alia </i>to the stairs, the lifts and the chutes. All these are not just facilities, or conveniences provided at discretion: they are essentials of the tenancy without which life in the dwellings, as a tenant, is not possible. To leave the landlord free of contractual obligation as regards these matters, and subject only to administrative or political pressure, is, in my opinion, inconsistent totally with the nature of this relationship. The subject matter of the lease (high-rise blocks) and the relationship created by the tenancy demands, of its nature, some contractual obligation on the landlord. It remains to define the standard. My Lords, if, as I think, the test of the existence of the term is necessity the standard must surely not exceed what is necessary having regard to the circumstances. To imply an absolute obligation to repair would go beyond what is a necessary legal incident and would indeed be unreasonable. An obligation to take reasonable care to keep in reasonable repair and usability is what fits the requirements of the case. Such a definition involves—and I think rightly—recognition that the tenants themselves have their responsibilities. What it is reasonable to expect of a landlord has a clear relation to what a reasonable set of tenants should do for themselves”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Wilberforce therefore envisages three accepted situations in which terms may be implied, and a fourth, championed by Lord Denning MR in the Court of Appeal in this case, which Lord Wilberforce rejects. The first is implication from custom, and the second is implication in fact to make the contract work. He observes that in either of these cases the contract may appear complete without the implied term, although it will not work in accordance with what must be taken to be the parties&#8217; intentions. The third case is implication in law, where the contract is manifestly incomplete and must necessarily be supplemented. It seems fair enough to remark, as Lord Wilberforce does, that these instances of implication exist upon a spectrum in so far as the notion of necessity links them. Lord Denning MR&#8217;s willingness to imply terms because they would be merely reasonable is beyond the spectrum and wrong.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">On its face, this case is confusing. It is said more than once by their Lordships that domestic occupancy of the tower block is not feasible without working lifts, lighting and rubbish chutes. The term implied by Lord Wilberforce amounts to an obligation upon the council to take reasonable care to maintain these facilities. Since it is put no higher than that, it is possible that the council might take reasonable care but still fail to deliver the service, without negligence on its part. No doubt the decision is sensible, because it is rightly pointed out that the tenants have their own obligations to work towards and not against the maintenance of the building. Nevertheless, the reasoning is hard to follow on a technical level, because a stated necessity is to be secured by a means which may fall short, being less than unconditional.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The reason this happens is that their Lordships very properly use a two-part test for the implication of a term here, as suggested in connection with The Moorcock above. The use of the facilities, and therefore the implication of a term, are necessities (an expression denoting that they are absolutely required). The term to be implied should not go beyond what is necessary (an expression limiting the obligation to the one appropriate in all the circumstances). </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It would have been more straightforward to concede that the test for whether to imply a term is necessity, but that the test for the specific term then to imply is reasonableness or proportionality.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In more recent cases, “necessity” as the test for implication of terms from the parties&#8217; legal relationship has come under pressure.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The latter area may drift further away from interpretation in fact, to which it was once tethered, and to which the requirement of necessity properly belongs.

Clause 1 on the charter stated that the vessel was “in every way fitted for ordinary cargo service” (the “seaworthiness clause”). The shipowners were bound to keep the vessel in a fit state. Any repair taking more than 24 hours would cause the payment of hire to be suspended. Such “off-hire” days could be added on to the overall duration of the charter, at the charterers&#8217; option. The vessel was in fact off-hire for substantial periods as a result of engine trouble and the incompetence of the short-handed crew. Not long after the charter period began, the market rate for freight carriage dropped, so that the charterers could have obtained a ship more cheaply. The charterers wrote to the shipowners to terminate the contract for breach of condition.<br>&emsp;&emsp;At first instance, the judge found that the contract had been wrongfully repudiated. The Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. Sellers LJ stated that the seaworthiness clause was a warranty. Upjohn LJ said that the question was whether the breach of the clause went so much to the root of the contract as to make its further commercial performance impossible. <span class="bd">Diplock LJ</span> said that the seaworthiness clause was to be viewed as neither a condition nor a warranty, but as an “intermediate” or “innominate” term for breach of which the remedy would be the one best apportioned to the breach itself and its consequences.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para54"></a><a name="para53"></a>“Lawyers tend to speak of [the bipartite classification of terms] as if it were comprehensive, partly for the historical reasons which I have already mentioned and partly because Parliament itself adopted it in the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, as respects a number of implied terms in contracts for the sale of goods and has in that Act used the expressions &#8220;condition&#8221; and &#8220;warranty&#8221; in that meaning. But it is by no means true of contractual undertakings in general at common law.<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para55">No doubt there are many simple contractual undertakings, sometimes express but more often because of their very simplicity (&#8220;It goes without saying&#8221;) to be implied, of which it can be predicated that every breach of such an undertaking must give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract. And such a stipulation, unless the parties have agreed that breach of it shall not entitle the non-defaulting party to treat the contract as repudiated, is a &#8220;condition&#8221;. So too there may be other simple contractual undertakings of which it can be predicated that no breach can give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract; and such a stipulation, unless the parties have agreed that breach of it shall entitle the non-defaulting party to treat the contract as repudiated, is a &#8220;warranty &#8220;.</a<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para56">There are, however, many contractual undertakings of a more complex character which cannot be categorised as being &#8220;conditions&#8221; or &#8220;warranties&#8221; if the late nineteenth century meaning adopted in the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, and used by Lord Justice Bowen in Bensen v. Taylor Sons &amp; Co. (1893 2 Queen&#8217;s Bench page 274, at page 280) be given to those terms. Of such undertakings all that can be predicated is that some breaches will and others will not give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract;and the legal consequences of a breach of such an undertaking, unless provided for expressly in the contract, depend upon the nature of the event to which the breach gives rise and do not follow automatically from a prior classification of the undertaking as a &#8220;condition&#8221; or a &#8220;warranty&#8221;. </a><a name="para57"></a<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para58">As my brethren have already pointed out, the shipowner&#8217;s undertaking to tender a seaworthy ship has, as a result of numerous decisions as to what can amount to &#8220;unseaworthiness&#8221;, become one of the most complex of contractual undertakings. It embraces obligations with respect to every part of the hull and machinery, stores and equipment and the crew itself. It can be broken by the presence of trivial defects easily and rapidly remediable as well as by defects which must inevitably result in a total loss of the vessel.</a<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para59">Consequently the problem in this case is, in my view, neither solved nor soluble by debating whether the shipowner&#8217;s express or implied undertaking to tender a seaworthy ship is a &#8220;condition&#8221; or a &#8220;warranty&#8221;. It is like so many other contractual terms an undertaking one breach of which may give rise to an event which relieves the charterer of further performance of his undertakings if he so elects and another breach of which may not give rise to such an event but entitle him only to monetary compensation in the form of damages. It is, with all deference to Mr. Ashton Roskill&#8217;s skilful argument, by no means surprising that among the many hundreds of previous cases about the shipowner&#8217;s undertaking to deliver a seaworthy ship there is none where it was found profitable to discuss in the judgments the question whether that undertaking is a &#8220;condition&#8221; or a &#8220;warranty&#8221;; for the true answer, as I have already indicated, is that it is neither, but one of that large class of contractual undertakings one breach of which may have the same effect as that ascribed to a breach of &#8220;condition&#8221; under the Sale of Goods Act and a different breach of which may have only the same effect as that ascribed to a breach of &#8220;warranty&#8221; under that Act.</a><a name="para60">...</a<br>&emsp;&emsp;What the learned judge had to do in the present case as in any other case where one party to a contract relies upon a breach by the other party as giving him a right to elect to rescind the contract, was to look at the events which had occurred as a result of the breach at the time at which the charterers purported to rescind the charter-party and to decide whether the occurrence of those events deprived the charterers of substantially the whole benefit which it was the intention of the parties as expressed in the charter-party that the charterers should obtain from the further performance of their own contractual undertakings”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;How does the orthodox classification co-exist with Lord Diplock&#8217;s analysis? The orthodox labelling of terms as conditions or warranties remains prima facie appropriate where the labels have been applied by the parties, and it is also holds where the term under examination is one which can be breached only in a restricted range of ways. Later cases emphatically add that the orthodox classification continues to govern where it is mandated by binding authority in respect of specific terms. Beyond these instances, the innominate analysis appears to be the correct one.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In the application of that analysis it is easy to take a wrong step by regarding an innominate term as effectively a condition if the consequences of its breach are serious, and a warranty if otherwise. If this were right, Lord Diplock would have achieved little; the innominate analysis would merely identify terms in a middle ground, and use the consequences of breach as a prompt to help decide which way they should go.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The innominate understanding of terms is more than a way of introducing some order into the debatable middle ground between conditions and warranties. It has deep jurisprudential roots in the historical development of contract law. The breach of an innominate term will justify termination of the contract only where it deprives the wronged party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract – the threshold for termination is set very high. The explanation for this is that Lord Diplock means to derive termination for breach from the same stratum within contract that produces termination for frustration (where the contract, without fault of either party, has become impossible or effectively impossible of performance). His full discussion of these parallel doctrines, as he regards them, has not been reproduced above for reasons of space, but it includes his perception that the right to terminate arises not so much from the fact of breach itself, as from the event which the breach constitutes. In parallel with the law of frustration, where it is axiomatic that frustration operates automatically, and in parallel with the doctrine of conditions precedent, the event simply leaves the parties free of further obligations to each other. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">On this view, it is actually the continuing liberty of the wronged party to elect to keep the contract going which starts to appear anomalous. The radical equation of lines of contractual reasoning which Lord Diplock is seeking to bring about in the Hong Kong Fir seems to leave little room for that choice. An associated point is astutely made by Megaw LJ in the later case of Bunge Corpn v Tradax (1981). If, ex hypothesi, the choice between termination and affirmation of the contract only exists where the wronged party has been deprived of substantially the whole benefit that the contract was to provide, why would a party in that position ever wish to affirm?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Hong Kong Fir is not the only exercise in jurisprudence by Lord Diplock which excites admiration mixed with the slight unease that it may prove too much. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In fact there were no good grounds to expect the ship to be ready to load on or around that date, since she was still engaged on another charter. The charterers, meanwhile, found that as a result (so they thought) of the war in Vietnam they could not obtain the expected cargo, and terminated the charter claiming force majeure. This ground of termination was found to be invalid. In the shipowners&#8217; action for damages for wrongful repudiation, the issue for the court was whether a breach of Clause 1 gave a right to terminate the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the Court of Appeal, Megaw LJ held that Clause 1 was a condition, so that its breach did give rise to the right to terminate. Binding authority led to this conclusion. Furthermore, the law needed to be predictable.

Notice of readiness to load was in fact given on 17 June, and was therefore insufficient if the goods were to be shipped before the end of that month, as the contract required. The sellers treated this as a breach of condition entitling them to terminate the contract.

The decision of the Court of Appeal was that this obligation was not a condition, a breach of which entitled the charterer to repudiate. It was pointed out that, as could be seen in advance the breaches, which might occur of it, were various. They might be extremely trivial, the omission of a nail; they might be extremely grave, a serious defect in the hull or in the machinery; they might be of serious but not fatal gravity, incompetence or incapacity of the crew. The decision, and the judgments of the Court of Appeal, drew from these facts the inescapable conclusion that it was impossible to ascribe to the obligation, in advance, the character of a condition.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Diplock LJ then generalised this particular consequence into the analysis which has since become classical. The fundamental fallacy of the appellant&#8217;s argument lies in attempting to apply this analysis to a time clause such as the present in a mercantile contract, which is totally different in character. As to such a clause there is only one kind of breach possible, namely, to be late, and the questions which have to be asked are, first, what importance have the parties expressly ascribed to this consequence, and secondly, in the absence of expressed agreement, what consequence ought to be attached to it having regard to the contract as a whole.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The test suggested by the appellants was a different one. One must consider, they said, the breach actually committed and then decide whether that default would deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit of the contract. They invoked even certain passages in the judgment of Diplock LJ in <i>Hong Kong Fir </i>to support it. One may observe in the first place that the introduction of a test of this kind would be commercially most undesirable. It would expose the parties, after a breach of one, two, three, seven and other numbers of days to an argument whether this delay would have left time for the seller to provide the goods. It would make it, at the time, at least difficult, and sometimes impossible, for the supplier to know whether he could do so. It would fatally remove from a vital provision in the contract that certainty which is the most indispensable quality of mercantile contracts, and lead to a large increase in arbitrations. It would confine the seller—perhaps after arbitration and reference through the courts—to a remedy in damages which might be extremely difficult to quantify. These are all serious objections in practice. But I am clear<br<br>&emsp;&emsp;that the submission is unacceptable in law. The judgment of Diplock LJ does not give any support and ought not to give any encouragement to any such proposition; for beyond doubt it recognises that it is open to the parties to agree that, as regards a particular obligation, any breach shall entitle the party not in default to treat the contract as repudiated. Indeed, if he were not doing so he would, in a passage which does not profess to be more than clarificatory, be discrediting a long and uniform series of cases—at least from <i>Bowes </i>v. <i>Shand </i>(1877) 2 App. Cas. 455 onwards which have been referred to by my noble and learned friend. Lord Roskill. It remains true, as Lord Roskill has pointed out in <i>Cehave N.V. </i>v. <i>Bremer Handelsgesellschaft m.b.H. </i>[1976] 1 Q.B. 44, that the courts should not be too ready to interpret contractual clauses as conditions. And I have myself commended, and continue to commend, the greater flexibility in the law of contracts to which <i>Hong Kong Fir </i>points the way <i>(Reardon Smith Line Ltd. </i>v. <i>Hansen-Tangen </i>[1976] 1 W.L.R. 989, 998). But I do not doubt that, in suitable cases, the courts should not be reluctant, if the intentions of the<br<br>&emsp;&emsp;arties as shown by the contract so indicate, to hold that an obligation has the force of a condition, and that indeed they should usually do so in the case of time clauses in mercantile contracts”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;To read a contract without an awareness of the vital provisions which may be implied into it by statute would be an entirely pointless exercise.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Numerous statutes and other instruments may imply terms into contracts. For the purposes of this year, no more than a first approach is made to the legislative impact on the contents of contracts. To achieve practical competence in this area would require study; the GDL course attempts at least to lay the foundations of an understanding of how statute influences the interpretation and litigation of contracts.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Most of the material which follows is provided only to give the context in which a few, extremely important provisions occur. These, which are printed in bold, need to be learnt. One or two sections which are particularly relevant to subjects covered later in the course are also in bold.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Sale of Goods Act 1979 remains very close in structure and content to the original Act passed in 1893. This was a codifying Act, drafted by Sir Mackenzie Chalmers with a view to summing up actual mercantile practice and expectations as faithfully as possible. Before being passed, it was scrutinised in particular by Lords Herschell, <span class="bd">Bramwell</span> and Halsbury, as well as others. The 1893 Act was repealed in 1979, but that should not be taken to be a sign that it had outlived its usefulness. Far from it; in fact the 1979 Act which replaced it closely followed its structure and reproduced a great deal of its content.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Sale of Goods Act is one of the corner-stones of English commercial law, together with the loyalty and responsiveness which the courts have shown to parties&#8217; contractually expressed intentions. It has deserved to be carefully maintained and, when necessary, updated. The 1979 Act has itself been amended, and some of the changes to it will be noted after the main run of text, together with very limited commentary on certain provisions. The most significant modification is that from 1 October 2015 the 1979 Act and the 1982 Supply of Goods and Services Act <b>no longer apply to consumer contracts</b>. These are now regulated by the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Changes made by that Act to the original legislation have been printed below in italics.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1) This Act applies to contracts of sale of goods made on or after (but not to those made before) 1 January 1894.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) In relation to contracts made on certain dates, this Act applies subject to the modification of certain of its sections as mentioned in Schedule 1 below.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) Any such modification is indicated in the section concerned by a reference to Schedule 1 below.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) Accordingly, where a section does not contain such a reference, this Act applies in relation to the contract concerned without such modification of the section.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(5) Certain sections or subsections of this Act do not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>(1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract by which the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a money consideration, called the price.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) There may be a contract of sale between one part owner and another.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer the contract is called a sale.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(5) Where under a contract of sale the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition later to be fulfilled the contract is called an agreement to sell.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(6) An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1) Capacity to buy and sell is regulated by the general law concerning capacity to contract and to transfer and acquire property.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) Where necessaries are sold and delivered [to a minor or] to a person who by reason of [mental incapacity or] drunkenness is incompetent to contract, he must pay a reasonable price for them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) In subsection (2) above “necessaries” means goods suitable to the condition in life of the [minor or other] person concerned and to his actual requirements at the time of the sale and delivery.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1) Subject to this and any other Act, a contract of sale may be made in writing (either with or without seal), or by word of mouth, or partly in writing and partly by word of mouth, or may be implied from the conduct of the parties.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1) The goods which form the subject of a contract of sale may be either existing goods, owned or possessed by the seller, or goods to be manufactured or acquired by him after the making of the contract of sale, in this Act called future goods.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) There may be a contract for the sale of goods the acquisition of which by the seller depends on a contingency which may or may not happen.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) Where by a contract of sale the seller purports to effect a present sale of future goods, the contract operates as an agreement to sell the goods.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the goods without the knowledge of the seller have perished at the time when the contract is made, the contract is void.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where there is an agreement to sell specific goods and subsequently the goods, without any fault on the part of the seller or buyer, perish before the risk passes to the buyer, the agreement is avoided.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>(1) The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in a manner agreed by the contract, or may be determined by the course of dealing between the parties.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>(2) Where the price is not determined as mentioned in sub-section (1) above the buyer must pay a reasonable price.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>(3) What is a reasonable price is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case</b>.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1 )Unless a different intention appears from the terms of the contract, stipulations as to time of payment are not of the essence of a contract of sale.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) Whether any other stipulation as to time is or is not of the essence of the contract depends on the terms of the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) In a contract of sale “month” prima facie means calendar month.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>(2) Where a contract of sale is subject to a condition to be fulfilled by the seller, the buyer may waive the condition, or may elect to treat the breach of the condition as a breach of warranty and not as a ground for treating the contract as repudiated.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>(3) Whether a stipulation in a contract of sale is a condition, the breach of which may give rise to a right to treat the contract as repudiated, or a warranty, the breach of which may give rise to a claim for damages but not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated, depends in each case on the construction of the contract; and a stipulation may be a condition, though called a warranty in the contract.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) Subject to section 35A below where a contract of sale is not severable and the buyer has accepted the goods or part of them, the breach of a condition to be fulfilled by the seller can only be treated as a breach of warranty, and not as a ground for rejecting the goods and treating the contract as repudiated, unless there is an express or implied term of the contract to that effect.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4A) Subsection (4) does not apply to a Contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in sections 19 to 22 of that Act).<br>&emsp;&emsp;(6) Nothing in this section affects a condition or warranty whose fulfilment is excused by law by reason of impossibility or otherwise.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(7) Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 below applies in relation to a contract made before 22 April 1967 or (in the application of this Act to Northern Ireland) 28 July 1967.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>(1) In a contract of sale, other than one to which subsection (3) below applies, there is an implied [term] on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale he has a right to sell the goods, and in the case of an agreement to sell he will have such a right at the time when the property is to pass.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) In a contract of sale, other than one to which subsection (3) below applies, there is also an implied [term] that—<br>&emsp;&emsp;(a) the goods are free, and will remain free until the time when the property is to pass, from any charge or encumbrance not disclosed or known to the buyer before the contract is made, and<br>&emsp;&emsp;(b) the buyer will enjoy quiet possession of the goods except so far as it may be disturbed by the owner or other person entitled to the benefit of any charge or encumbrance so disclosed or known.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) This subsection applies to a contract of sale in the case of which there appears from the contract or is to be inferred from its circumstances an intention that the seller should transfer only such title as he or a third person may have.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) In a contract to which subsection (3) above applies there is an implied [<href="#commentary-c1108890" title="View the commentary text for this item">F6</a>term] that all charges or encumbrances known to the seller and not known to the buyer have been disclosed to the buyer before the contract is made.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(5) In a contract to which subsection (3) above applies there is also an implied [<href="#commentary-c1108890" title="View the commentary text for this item">F6</a>term] that none of the following will disturb the buyer&#8217;s quiet possession of the goods, namely—<br>&emsp;&emsp;(b) in a case where the

implied by subsection (1) above is a condition and the terms implied by subsections (2), (4) and (5) above are warranties.]</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;6) Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 below applies in relation to a contract made before 18 May 1973.<br>&emsp;&emsp;7) This section does not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in section 17 of that Act).<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied [term] that the goods will correspond with the description.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>[ (1A)As regards England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the term implied by subsection (1) above is a condition.]</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) If the sale is by sample as well as by description it is not sufficient that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample if the goods do not also correspond with the description.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) A sale of goods is not prevented from being a sale by description by reason only that, being exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the buyer.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 below applies in relation to a contract made before 18 May 1973.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(5) This section does not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in section 11 of that Act).<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1)Except as provided by this section and section 15 below and subject to any other enactment, there is no implied [term] about the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>[ (2) Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is an implied term that the goods supplied under the contract are of satisfactory quality.</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2A) For the purposes of this Act, goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2B)For the purposes of this Act, the quality of goods includes their state and condition and the following (among others) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of goods—<br>&emsp;&emsp;(a) fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied,<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2C) The term implied by subsection (2) above does not extend to any matter making the quality of goods

made, which that examination ought to reveal, or<br>&emsp;&emsp;(c) in the case of a contract for sale by sample, which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample.]<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business and the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known—<br>&emsp;&emsp;(b) where the purchase price or part of it is payable by instalments and the goods were previously sold by a credit-broker to the seller, to that credit-broker,<br>&emsp;&emsp;any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought, there is an implied [term] that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are commonly supplied, except where the circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the skill or judgment of the seller or credit-broker.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(4) An implied [term] about quality or fitness for a particular purpose may be annexed to a contract of sale by usage.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(5) The preceding provisions of this section apply to a sale by a person who in the course of a business is acting as agent for another as they apply to a sale by a principal in the course of a business, except where that other is not selling in the course of a business and either the buyer knows that fact or reasonable steps are taken to bring it to the notice of the buyer before the contract is made.<br>&emsp;&emsp;b>[ (6) As regards England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the terms implied by subsections (2) and (3) above are conditions.]</b<br>&emsp;&emsp;(7) Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 below applies in relation to a contract made on or after 18 May 1973 and before the appointed day, and paragraph 6 in relation to one made before 18 May 1973.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(8) In subsection (7) above and paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 below references to the appointed day are to the day appointed for the purposes of those provisions by an order of the Secretary of State made by statutory instrument.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(9) This section does not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in sections 9, 10 and 18 of that Act).<br>&emsp;&emsp;(1) A contract of sale is a contract for sale by sample

It was supplied as “common English sainfoin”, but when it germinated it was found to be giant sainfoin, an inferior strain. The plaintiffs settled actions brought against them by the sub-buyer, and sued the defendants. The defendants relied on a clause in the contract which read “Sellers give no warranty, express or implied, as to growth, description, or any other matters...”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords upheld the plaintiffs&#8217; claim for damages, approving the dissenting judgment of Fletcher Moulton LJ in the Court of Appeal. He had based himself on the distinction between warranties and conditions, observing that the failure of the seed to correspond with its contractual description was a breach of condition. The clause in the contract referred only to warranties. Since it was admitted that a condition had been breached, the clause had no application.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;As a matter of language, it obviously cannot be said that this reading of the contract is unsustainable – quite the contrary. The difficulty arises when one stands back and considers the broader picture or the matrix of fact. Is it plausible to suppose that the sellers felt it necessary to exclude all warranties, but were content to leave all conditions standing? Or is the reality that they slipped up in their drafting, and the court allowed the plaintiff to take advantage of the slip? Perhaps the answer is that one cannot really decide the matter in the absence of plentiful evidence, and that to purport to do so on a narrow linguistic basis actually does violence not so much to language, as to the public interest in true adjudication.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The rejoinder to this would be along the lines already mapped in lecture 10; provided people in business are aware that courts apply a particular technique to the construction of exemption clauses no harm is done. They must simply take care that their documents say what they mean them to say. In the case of consumer contracts, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 now imposes on traders a tersely-worded obligation to do exactly that (s.68). By s.69, the contra proferentem rule seems to obtain statutory backing.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The contract included a clause which read: “All cars sold by the company are subject to the terms of the warranty set out in Schedule No. 3 of this agreement and all conditions, warranties and liabilities implied by common law, statute or otherwise are excluded”. One of the cars supplied was not new, in the sense that it had already been driven some 550 miles to be shown to a potential customer. The question was whether the clause given above was effective to prevent liability arising.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that it was not. The contract was expressly for the sale of new cars. The clause only ousted implied terms, not express ones.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Counsel for the defendants argued that the description of the cars as “new” was an implied term, because section 13 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 stated that “where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods shall correspond with the description...”. In the opinion of Scrutton LJ, this submission put a very strained meaning on the word “implied” in the section. Where goods were expressly described in the contract and did not comply with the description, it was quite inaccurate to say that there was an implied term.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Who is right? One of several difficulties with the defendant&#8217;s submission is that it can be extended to prove too much. Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, an exemption clause which purports to make it not a sale by description attacks the contract itself. The practitioner text Benjamin on Sale says the following about this situation: “Once the court has decided that the sale was a sale by description of “new Singer cars” then nothing else could satisfy the contract and by no artifice could the seller avoid the obligation to provide new Singer cars. Startling results would follow otherwise, for, if the seller can ignore one of the three descriptive words, he can ignore the others; the article need not be a Singer car, or even a car. The seller might supply a second-hand pedal bicycle or a child&#8217;s perambulator! In a sale by description one is selling a described thing or things and that is fundamental and one need not really consider conditions or warranties express or implied as ordinarily understood”. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The idea being put forward in the passage from <i>Benjamin on Sale</i> quoted above is a well-known one of long standing. It is often stated in terms derived from an early nineteenth century case, <i>Chanter v Hopkins</i> (1838) 4 M &amp; W 399, in which Lord Abinger said “If a man offers to buy peas of another, and he sends him beans, he does not perform his contract”. The next case is generally taken to be a “peas and beans” decision.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The car had remained in the possession of its original owner, a man named Stinton. Wallis, the intending purchaser and defendant, had been unable to buy it outright from Stinton because he lacked the money, so Stinton had sold the vehicle to Karsales, which sold it to a finance company which let it on hire purchase to Wallis. The hire purchase agreement was later taken over by Karsales. The car was subsequently towed to Wallis&#8217;s premises at night and left. The cylinder head was missing, the engine valves had been burnt out, two pistons were broken, the tyres damaged and the radio had been removed. In bringing their claim for arrears, Karsales placed reliance on Clause 3(g) of the agreement which stated “No condition or warranty that the vehicle is roadworthy, or as to its age, condition or fitness for any purpose is given by the owner or implied herein”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the judgment of the Court of Appeal the exemption clause could not apply. The agreement related to a car. The vehicle in question could no longer be regarded as a car, because it was so grossly damaged as to be incapable of self-propulsion.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;One of the problems with the “peas and beans” approach is that it would seem to lead to impossible exercises in line-drawing. When is a car so badly damaged as no longer to be a car? At one extreme of the spectrum it would no doubt be specious to try to maintain that a compressed block of metal was still the car that it had once been. But that simply attracts attention to the rest of the spectrum in which suitable divisions do not readily appear. One way in which the problem can be re-phrased, if not exactly solved, is to associate the peas/beans extreme with cases of non-performance of the contract rather than its defective performance. It might be posited that an exemption clause may stand in a case of defective performance, but cannot excuse non-performance. In a sense this must be true. Imagine an exemption which consists in denying all liability on the contract. That would render performance a matter of the one party&#8217;s discretion, as distinct from legal obligation, and the entire contractual edifice would fall (its collapse could be put in terms of a failure of offer and acceptance, or of consideration, or of intention to create legal relations, or all three). Logically, then, an exemption clause must stop short of total efficacy. Non-performance is one way of defining the class of breach which cannot be covered by exempting words. It is a rough and ready way of doing it, not a perfect one.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Great care is needed at this point, because another conceptual problem now arises. The idea that a certain type of breach is too fundamental to be covered by an exemption clause will be found in <i>Karsales v Wallis</i> and some other cases, but it shades into an analysis which the House of Lords has overruled.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

A number of visits were to be made each night, seven nights of the week. The weekly charge was low: £8 15s. One of the clauses in the contract stated that “under no circumstances shall [Securicor] be responsible for any injurious act or default by any employee of [Securicor] unless such act or default could have been foreseen and avoided by the exercise of due diligence on the part of [Securicor] as his employer...”. One of Securicor&#8217;s duty employees, in the course of a visit to the premises, decided to light a fire by throwing a match onto some cartons. The fire got out of control, and burnt down a substantial part of Photo Productions&#8217; premises, causing damage amounting to £615,000. Photo Productions sued for damages. Securicor relied on its clause.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal, applying the doctrine of fundamental breach, held that the employee&#8217;s behaviour had brought the contract to an end, or that the clause could not be construed to apply to the breach which had occurred. The House of Lords, reversing the Court of Appeal in this case and overruling <i>Harbutt&#8217;s Plasticine</i>, held that the doctrine of fundamental breach amounted to a rule of construction only. Here the clause was effective to shield Securicor from liability. Securicor&#8217;s very modest charge for its service, and its lack of knowledge of Photo Productions&#8217; premises and fire precautions, led to the inference that the contract left the risk of damage on Photo Productions.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The bedrock of Lord Wilberforce&#8217;s speech in the House of Lords is his perception that the Court of Appeal, both in this case and in its earlier decision in <i>Harbutt&#8217;s Plasticine</i>, had entirely misunderstood the House&#8217;s decision in <i>Suisse Atlantique Societe d&#8217;Armement Maritime SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale</i> [1967] 1 AC 361. The speeches in the <i>Suisse Atlantique</i> case had admittedly been less than clear. However, on a fair reading, they put paid to any suggestion that the law included a substantive doctrine of fundamental breach invalidating exemption clauses upon a contract&#8217;s termination. The Court of Appeal, in holding otherwise, had based itself on mere dicta in their Lordships&#8217; speeches. While it was true to say (as a presumption to be applied when interpreting a contract) that the parties would not readily be taken to have intended a fundamental breach to be covered by an exemption clause, the ultimate question was simply whether the clause did or did not apply on the true construction of the contract.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

However, its very breadth made it capable of covering not only loss caused by negligence but other types of loss as well.

The “other ground” must not be so fanciful or remote that the proferens cannot be supposed to have desired protection against it; but subject to this qualification, which is no doubt to be implied from Lord Greene&#8217;s words, the existence of a possible head of damage other than that of negligence is fatal to the proferens even if the words used are prima facie wide enough to cover negligence on the part of his servants”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The unintuitive characteristic of these rules consists in the way that two apparent concessions towards exclusions of negligence liability are followed by a twist.

As a result of the defendants&#8217; negligence there was a fire which badly damaged the car. The plaintiff sued for damages. The defendants attempted to rely on a clause contained in an invoice, stating that “The company is not responsible for damage caused by fire to customers&#8217; cars on the premises”. The trial judge accepted that this clause had been incorporated in the contract by a course of dealing, since on a few previous occasions the plaintiff had signed the form containing the notice.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge on the incorporation point, holding the course of dealing to have been insufficient. This was enough to dispose of the case, but their lordships went on to consider whether the clause would have protected the defendants against negligence liability had it been validly incorporated. They said that it would not.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The judgment of Salmon LJ is an instructive application of the <i>Canada Steamship</i> rules, since it measures their effect within a real setting:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“It is well settled that a clause excluding liability for negligence should make its meaning plain on its face to any ordinarily literate and sensible person. The easiest way of doing that, of course, is to state expressly that the garage, tradesman or merchant, as the case may be, will not be responsible for any damage caused by his own negligence. No doubt merchants, tradesmen and garage proprietors and the like are a little shy of writing in an exclusion clause quite so bluntly as that. Clearly it would not tend to attract customers, and might even put many off. I am not saying that an exclusion clause cannot be effective to exclude negligence unless it does so expressly, but in order for the clause to be effective the language should be so plain that it clearly bears that meaning. I do not think that defendants should be allowed to shelter behind language which might lull the customer into a false sense of security by letting him think – unless perhaps he happens to be a lawyer – that he would have redress against the man with whom he was dealing for any damage which he, the customer, might suffer by the negligence of that person.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The principles are stated by Scrutton LJ with his usual clarity in <i>Rutter v Palmer</i> [1922] 2 KB 87, 92:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“For the present purposes a rougher test will serve. In construing an exemption clause certain general rules may be applied. First the defendant is not exempted from liability for the negligence of his servants unless adequate words are used; secondly, the liability of the defendant apart from the exempting words must be ascertained; then the particular clause in question must be considered; and if the only liability of the party pleading the exemption is a liability for negligence, the clause will more readily operate to exempt him”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Scrutton LJ was far too great a lawyer, and had far too much robust common sense, if I may be permitted to say so, to put it higher than “if the only liability of the party pleading the exemption is a liability for negligence, the clause will more readily operate to exempt him”. He does not say “if the only liability of the party pleading the exemption is a liability for negligence, the clause will necessarily exempt him”. After all, there are many cases in the books dealing with exemption clauses, and in every case it comes down to a question of construing the alleged exemption clause which is then before the court”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In the particulars of sale they described Mr Fleck both as a “most desirable” and as a “very desirable” tenant. In fact, Mr Fleck had fallen behind with the latest instalment of the rent, and had paid the previous instalment very late. After the contract was concluded, he became bankrupt. The plaintiffs sought specific performance of the contract, and the defendant buyers counterclaimed for rescission for misrepresentation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs&#8217; statements amounted to misrepresentation.

It is material to observe that it is often fallaciously assumed that a statement of opinion cannot involve the statement of a fact. In a case where the facts are equally well known to both parties, what one of them says to the other is frequently nothing but an expression of opinion. The statement of such opinion is in a sense a statement of a fact, about the condition of the man&#8217;s own mind, but only of an irrelevant fact, for it is of no consequence what the opinion is. But if the facts are not equally known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by the one who knows the facts best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly states that he knows facts which justify his opinion”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Bowen LJ&#8217;s proposition above deserves careful attention. It can be very useful in preparing an accurately pleaded misrepresentation case. Where a statement of the defendant is “tainted” by opinion, it is possible to plead it as nothing more than a statement, and therefore in itself neutral, but then to extract from it the implied representation of fact on which it is based.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The prospectus invited subscriptions to be made in return for bonds, and stated that the money received would be used for expanding the company&#8217;s business by the purchase of horses and vans, and by pursuing plans to develop a business supplying cheap fish. In fact the intention of the directors was to use most of the money to pay off the company&#8217;s creditors. The company later went into liquidation, and the plaintiff sued for the return of his money by way of damages for misrepresentation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that this action succeeded. Bowen LJ, in another very well-known explanation, indicated how the directors&#8217; statement of intention supposed a statement of present fact:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“There must be a misstatement of an existing fact: but the state of a man&#8217;s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state of a man&#8217;s mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else. A misrepresentation as to the state of a man&#8217;s mind is, therefore, a misstatement of fact”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">This is the first case cited here in which it matters to know the level of culpability being alleged against the defendants. The misrepresentation pleaded and found proven by the courts was fraudulent. This is why Bowen LJ&#8217;s analysis works. Behind what on its face was merely a promise (binding if supported by consideration but otherwise not) is a positive and present resolve to do something completely inconsistent with the promise. The misstated fact upon which the successful misrepresentation action is mounted is the deceiving assertion of honesty. It will be apparent, therefore, that the ratio of this case cannot easily be extended beyond the type of misrepresentation which is wilful – ie. fraudulent misrepresentation. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Until recently it was thought that statements of law could not be actionable misrepresentations. The rationale for this rule was not entirely clear, and it contained provisos some of which were notoriously difficult to apply. In particular, the rule related only to statements of general law, and not to statements of private legal right. The distinction between these two categories was uncertain. Fortunately the law has now been clarified and simplified. Statements of law can found actions for misrepresentation.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

One of them was that National Car Parks was a mere contractual licensee with regard to one of the properties, so that its occupation could be terminated on three months&#8217; notice. That was false, since the company was in fact a business tenant, protected by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. The difficulty facing the purchaser was that the nature of NCP&#8217;s interest in the property was a matter of law (albeit a matter of private legal right).<br>&emsp;&emsp;Rex Tedd QC, sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court, held that these facts amounted to an actionable misrepresentation. The House of Lords in <i>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council</i> [1999] 2 AC 349, had abolished the rule that a mistake of law could not give rise to a remedy. The notion that “every person was presumed to know the law” had been shown in that case to be an entirely unwarranted outgrowth from the principle that ignorance of the law was no defence to a criminal charge. It was impossible to suppose that the bar to action for misrepresentation of law could survive the decision of the House of Lords on mistake of law, and desirable in any event that the common law should display consistency.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

This was substantially true of the two years to December 1933. However, between January and May, when the contract was concluded, the practice was neglected because of the ill health of the defendant. The buyers, when they first opened for business, found that no patients turned up, and that the practice had taken no more than £15 in the previous three weeks. They brought the present action to rescind the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that although the statement of turnover had been true when made, it was no longer accurate when the agreement was concluded.

It would be quite possible to imagine the law taking the contrary approach, and focusing on the moment when a representation first has its impact. The explanation for the acceptability of the somewhat more artificial analysis in fact adopted by the law is not simply that it enables justice to be done where a representor has stood by and allowed a true statement to go uncorrected when it later became misleading. It is also based on the principle that a representation must “induce” the contract, which is to say that it must be relied upon.

You had the means afforded you of discovering its falsity, and did not choose to avail yourself of them”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Nothing can be plainer, I take it, on the authorities in equity than that the effect of false representation is not got rid of on the ground that the person to whom it was made has been guilty of negligence.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where you have neither evidence that he knew facts to show that the statement was untrue, or that he said or did anything to show that he did not actually rely upon the statement, the inference remains that he did so rely, and the statement being a material statement, its being untrue is a sufficient ground for rescinding the contract”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Although this case remains good law, the fact that the representee may have been negligent in not taking an obvious opportunity to make his own checks can no longer be said to have no legal consequence. Following the passing of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945, it could now be made the basis for reducing an award of damages to reflect contributory negligence (though this would not apply if the representation were fraudulent).</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">That being said, it continues to be the case that the attitude of Lord Jessel broadly makes sense, and it is worth bearing in mind at all times when considering misrepresentation. This is not an area, unlike contract formation for example, in which the parties must be treated with even-handedness. The law will tend to lean against a misrepresentor, for the simple reason that he has made a statement which has proved to be false.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Misrepresentation exists on the borders of contract as a non-contractual wrong which goes on to result in loss occasioned by the representee&#8217;s entry into a contract. Misstatement exists beyond contract altogether. In fact negligent misstatement is a tort, and more specifically, part of the wider tort of negligence. Most of the analysis which goes into the establishment of the tort of negligence therefore applies to this action as well, albeit with certain modifications. Few of the preconditions for liability in misrepresentation <i>necessarily</i> apply to it.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">However, certain cases and several passages or remarks in textbooks reveal a reluctance to take the exclusively tortious nature of negligent misstatement seriously (eg. Professor Burrows&#8217; A Casebook on Contract (2<sup>nd</sup> ed, 2009) which inadmissibly refers to “tortious negligent misrepresentation”). <span class="bd">Treitel</span> also mixes up the terminologies.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Negligent misstatement must be kept entirely separate from misrepresentation. Negligent misstatement need not lead to the conclusion of a contract. It is not limited to statements of fact. It is not (technically, at least) limited to material statements, since materiality is a test which supposes later entry into a contract. A misstatement need not be proven false. It may in fact be false, but that is not a pre-condition of liability. The true requirement is that the misstatement should have caused loss to the person who relied upon it, and that it should have been negligently made.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">These jurisprudential differences between misrepresentations on the one hand and misstatement on the other are fundamental. That being said, the two actions are not mutually exclusive. Both may be present on the same facts, and they may be pleaded together. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The respondents provided a letter headed “without responsibility on the part of this bank” which went on to state that Easipower was “considered good for its ordinary business engagements”. The appellants relied on this in entering contracts with Easipower by which they gave the firm credit, and incurred substantial losses when Easipower subsequently went into liquidation. The appellants brought the present action in the tort of negligence against Easipower&#8217;s bankers. The respondents submitted that there was no duty of care with regard to the making of statements, or in the alternative, that any such duty had been negatived by their disclaimer of responsibility.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held unanimously that a duty to take care would have arisen in these circumstances had it not been prevented from doing so by the disclaimer. It had previously been thought that liability for negligent misstatement could exist only where there was a fiduciary relationship between the parties, but that view was too narrow. Where a “special relationship” existed between the parties, such that one must be taken to have assumed a responsibility to prevent negligently caused economic loss to the other, a tortious duty of care would be found.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest summed up the principle which would have been applied had responsibility not been expressly refused: “My Lords, I consider that it follows and that it should now be regarded as settled that if someone possessed of a special skill undertakes, quite irrespective of contract, to apply that skill for the assistance of another person who relies upon such skill, a duty of care will arise. The fact that the service is to be given by means of or by the instrumentality of words can make no difference. Furthermore, if in a sphere in which a person is so placed that others could reasonably rely upon his judgment or his skill or upon his ability to make careful inquiry, a person takes it upon himself to give information or advice to, or allows his information or advice to be passed on to, another person who, as he knows or should know, will place reliance upon it, then a duty of care will arise.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The language of Lord Morris, above, is significant. It makes no reference to the representing of facts, but to a quite different conception – the provision of skill, information or advice for another&#8217;s benefit. It is clear from this that negligent misstatement is effectively unrelated to misrepresentation despite the application by some commentators of the same terminology to the two actions. Negligent misstatement is entirely capable of dealing with statements of opinion, advice and belief, all of which are more problematic to characterise as representations.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The respondents, Caparo, bought shares in Fidelity in reliance upon the accounts. They later alleged that the accounts had been negligently prepared and certified, and that they would have not have bought the shares and suffered loss as a result had they known that. They asserted that the auditors had a duty of care to investors and potential investors, and that it had been breached.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords allowed the auditors&#8217; appeal, overturning the majority decision of the Court of Appeal. Although it had been “foreseeable” (in the broad, law of tort sense) that shareholders including Caparo might rely on the accounts, there was nevertheless insufficient proximity between them and the auditors. To extend the auditors&#8217; duty of care to cover a use of the accounts for which they were not in fact provided would be to go beyond the principles of liability deducible from existing House of Lords authority, which required the following elements to support the imposition of a duty: (a) that the loss sustained by the claimant was foreseeable; (b) that there was sufficient proximity between the claimant and the defendant; and (c) that it was fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care in the circumstances.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Bridge, referring to the three elements listed above, recognised that proximity and fairness were not capable of such precise definition as to be practical tests; rather, they were labels for those features of individual situations which the law would recognise pragmatically and on a case-by-case basis as giving rise to the duty of care.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Oliver of Aylmerton analysed the principles which could properly be extracted from <i>Hedley Byrne v Heller</i>:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“What can be deduced from the <i>Hedley Byrne</i> case, therefore, is that the necessary relationship between the maker of a statement or giver of advice (&#8220;the adviser&#8221;) and the recipient who acts in reliance upon it (&#8220;the advisee&#8221;) may typically be held to exist where (1) the advice is required for a purpose, whether particularly specified or generally described, which is made known, either actually or inferentially, to the adviser at the time when the advice is given; (2) the adviser knows, either actually or inferentially, that his advice will be<br<br>&emsp;&emsp;communicated to the advisee, either specifically or as a member of an ascertainable class, in order that it should be used by the advisee for that purpose; (3)it is known either actually or<br<br>&emsp;&emsp;nferentially, that the advice so communicated is likely to be acted upon by the advisee for that purpose without independent inquiry, and (4) it is so acted upon by the advisee to his<br<br>&emsp;&emsp;detriment. That is not, of course, to suggest that these conditions are either conclusive or exclusive, but merely that the actual decision in the case does not warrant any broader propositions”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The reasons for which the ambit of the duty needs to be defined in this way will probably be obvious to any student of tort, but it may nevertheless be helpful to confirm what is probably the main one. It is already made very clear in <i>Hedley Byrne</i> itself. Negligent words, as opposed to negligent actions, have a potentially limitless reach. The risk of indeterminate liability to an indeterminate class must be avoided.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-336'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Misrepresentation (1) - Introduction - Negligent Misstatement: Conditions of Liability</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;In outline, this action was part of litigation brought against managing agents in the Lloyds of London market by individual investors (“names”) who alleged that the funds to which they subscribed had been negligently managed. Links between names and managing agents were of two types – direct and indirect. Of particular relevance for the application of the <i>Hedley Byrne</i> principle were the relationships between names and managing agents which were indirect in that a member&#8217;s agent stood between the two (and the name&#8217;s contract was only with the member&#8217;s agent).<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held that the <i>Hedley Byrne</i> principle applied to both the relationships in issue in the litigation. The case has chiefly been regarded as authority, contrary to previous doctrine, that there was no principled reason why contractual and tortious liability should not exist concurrently in an action.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;As far as the further refinement of <i>Hedley Byrne</i> is concerned, the decision is significant because it vindicates the prime importance of the “assumption of responsibility” test in the leading case. This had come under criticism in some decisions subsequent to <i>Hedley Byrne</i>, chiefly because it came to be regarded as somewhat unrealistic and therefore misleading. In <i>Henderson v Merrett</i> Lord Goff rehabilitates this test. He goes on to explain that certain consequences follow from its affirmative nature. One is that a disclaimer of responsibility will prevent the duty of care from arising. Another is that an assumption of responsibility may well not be found where information or advice etc. is given in informal circumstances. Perhaps the most important consequence is that an assumption of responsibility makes it unnecessary to enquire whether it is “fair, just and reasonable” to recognise a duty of care not to cause economic loss. That question is overshadowed by the affirmative character of the assumption of responsibility.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Judicial discussion of what is meant by an “assumption of responsibility” does not end with this case, but it is far from being a clash between wholly opposing views. The difference is one merely of emphasis; the test undoubtedly includes an objective as well as a subjective enquiry, but while some have criticised the test because it downplays the objective view, others like Lord Goff clearly value it because its subjective framing allows it to be applied with some flexibility. All would agree that “assumption” must tend to mean “deemed assumption”. All would also agree that any test has limited validity within this area; the truth is that the facts of individual cases are decisive, and the difficulty of deriving general principles from them can clearly be seen. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The resemblance between “assumption of responsibility” and the test of intention in contract has been academically noticed (see Stathis Banakas, “Voluntary Assumption of Tort Liability in English Law: A Paradox?” InDret 4/2009). Ordinarily, tortious liability is imposed because of the relationship between the parties, irrespective of their thoughts on the subject. The parties&#8217; objectively understood intention, by contrast, is the basis of contractual liability. Negligent misstatement seems to have grown to resemble a contractual analysis. It is not imposed. It grows out of an objective assessment of the parties&#8217; dealings.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">A resemblance between the contractual perspective and the present action is not surprising. The circumstances in which negligent misstatement can be successfully used as a cause of action are effectively those in which it is anomalous that there is no contract linking the parties. Often, an implied contract could be found if it were not for the absence of consideration. Seen from the viewpoint of a contract lawyer, negligent misstatement presents itself as a means of doing justice where a narrow understanding of consideration prevents that being achieved through the law of contract.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The next case includes substantial discussion of the development of the law since <i>Hedley Byrne</i>, but in itself it is a direct application of the ratio of the leading case – a disclaimer is a factor likely to prevent the finding that responsibility has been assumed. It is included here on the assumption that it may be helpful to see a detailed example of the court&#8217;s handling of negligent misstatement in a context far easier to grasp than that of the Lloyds litigation.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He intended to demolish it and build a new house, and therefore was not going to have it surveyed before purchase. The vendors&#8217; agent was Lane Fox, represented at all material times by Mr Scott. The plaintiff had received details of the property from Lane Fox. They contained the statement that the garden was 0.92 of an acre, and a disclaimer of responsibility. The plaintiff said that he had not studied the particulars, but that he knew that they would include disclaimers. In the course of showing the property to the plaintiff, Mr Scott repeated the statement that the garden was 0.92 of an acre. In fact, when preparing the particulars, he had misread his own notes which showed that the garden was 0.48 of an acre. After buying the property, the plaintiff discovered the true size of the garden, and brought the present action alleging negligent misstatement by Lane Fox.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that the conditions of liability for negligent misstatement were present, save that the disclaimer in the particulars negatived the required proximity between the parties. The plaintiff&#8217;s appeal was therefore turned down.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para95"></a><a name="para94"></a>Hobhouse LJ explained how liability would have arisen but for the disclaimer: “In the present case there was a direct relationship between Mr Scott and Mr McCullagh. Mr Scott made the representation to Mr McCullagh: he chose to speak to him and make a factual statement which was designed to influence the decision making processes of Mr McCullagh. Mr Scott was holding himself out as a person who knew the area of the land being offered for sale, presumably because he had measured it or had supervised its measurement. He had a special knowledge which was not available to Mr McCullagh. The relation­ship was a business one. Mr Scott had a financial interest in influencing persons to buy the property and to buy at as high a price as could be negotiated. His remuneration, as everyone knew, was dependant upon someone agreeing to buy the land and upon the price at which that person was willing to purchase. He would be paid by way of a commission payable out of the deposit paid by the purchaser. Indirectly, he would be paid by the purchaser. The absence of a specific consideration moving directly from the representee to the representor is the only thing which prevents the rela­ti­on­ship between them from being contractual. Thus far I see nothing in the structure of the transaction which would negative a duty of care to be owed by the estate agent in relation to any representation the estate agent chooses to make to the prospective purchaser for the purpose of influenc­ing him to buy. It is his choice to make a representation intended to influence the representee which amounts to the assumption of responsibility. It is foreseeable that such a representation may be relied on since it was intended to have the effect of influencing the prospective purchaser to buy….<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para101"></a><a name="para100"></a>On the Sunday, Mr Scott knew, or ought to have known, that his representation was likely to be relied on by Mr McCullagh. However he also knew that Mr McCullagh had the Lane Fox particulars which included <i>both</i> the relevant statement and the disclaimer. In my judgment the result of this is that the element of proximity was negatived. A reasonable person, appreciating that the statement which he was proposing to rely upon was a statement contained in the particulars and the fact that those particulars also stated that<br>&emsp;&emsp;&#8221;all statements contained in these particulars as to this property are made without responsibility on the part of Lane Fox ...&#8221;,<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para102">would understand that there was no assumption of responsibility by Lane Fox. This understanding would be reinforced by para­graphs 3, 4 and 5 of the disclaimer. In my judgment the dis­claim­er puts the present case on all fours with the actual decision in <i>Hedley Byrne </i>as explained earlier.</a<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para103">The Judge avoided this conclusion by approaching the disclaimer as if it were a contractual exclusion. On such an approach it would need to be strictly construed and the argument was available that it did not as such cover an oral statement. But that is not, in my judgment, the right approach. It is not an exclusion to be construed. The right approach, as is made clear in <i>Hedley Byrne</i>, is to treat the existence of the disclaimer as one of the facts relevant to answering the question whether there had been an assumption of responsibility by the Defendants for the relevant statement. This question must be answered objectively by reference to what a reasonable person in the position of Mr McCullagh would have understood at the time that he finally relied upon the representation. In this context, it is obvious that the statement that the acreage of the property is 0.92 was a statement which was taken from the particulars and that the Defendants were not assuming responsi­bility for that statement. The mere fact that Mr Scott, when showing Mr Mc­Cullagh round the property, gave the same inform­ation to Mr McCullagh orally would not lead a reasonable person to conclude that the Defendants were there­by choosing to assume responsi­bility for the statement which they said in the particulars they were not assuming responsi­bility for. The sub­mission that such a conclusion would be reasonable is unreal. It was not supported by any evidence. Mr McCullagh said (surprisingly) that he had not bothered to read the particulars but he also said that he knew that they would contain disclaimers of the type which they in fact did. The submission was further inconsistent with paragraph 5 of the dis­claimer. The essence of the law of negligence is the application of objective standards of reason­ableness. By those standards, it is clear that the Defendants were not assuming responsibility for the accuracy of the statement about the acreage. The position might be different if the representation had been about something not, or not expected to be, included in the particulars”.</a</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;It may seem surprising that there is apparently such a difference of approach to a contractual exemption (usually treated as a defence and sometimes read down by strict construction), and a disclaimer of responsibility (regarded here as defining or indeed negating the duty of the defendant to the plaintiff). A means of explaining this distinction is to note that a contractual exemption must be judged on its effect upon promises for the performance of which the promisee has paid. A non-contractual disclaimer is judged in relation to information gratuitously offered, and therefore deserves a less narrow construction.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

In it, they stated that they had the right to power the trams mechanically instead of using horses. This was incorrect; in fact the consent of the Board of Trade was required for the use of steam or mechanical power. Consent was refused, and the company was wound up. The plaintiff, who had bought shares in the company on the strength of the prospectus, brought an action for damages for deceit.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held that the action must fail, since fraud had not been made out. The directors had assumed, honestly but mistakenly, that the giving of consent by the Board of Trade was a formality. This was reprehensible on their part, since they had no grounds for their assumption, but it was not dishonest.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Herschell defined the state of mind needed for fraud to be found: “I think the authorities establish the following propositions: First, in order to sustain an action of deceit, there must be proof of fraud, and nothing short of that will suffice. Secondly, fraud is proved where it is shewn that a false representation has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. Although I have treated the second and third as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth of what he states. To prevent a false statement being fraudulent, there must, I think, always be an honest belief in its truth. And this probably covers the whole ground, for one who knowingly alleges that which is false, has obviously no such honest belief. Thirdly, if fraud be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is immaterial. It matters not that there was no intention to cheat or injure the person to whom the statement was made”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Lord Herschell&#8217;s definition of fraud is fairly expansive. In practice it needs treating with care for two reasons. The first is that the heavy burden of proof for fraud discourages the making of that allegation on facts which technically fit the definition but fail to indicate a dishonest motive. The second reason for caution is that Lord Herschell spoke long before the passing of the Misrepresentation Act 1967. A reckless misrepresentation, absent the intention to cheat, would now more naturally be placed in the category of negligent misrepresentation as created by section 2(1). </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The next two cases concern the measure of damages which can be obtained for fraud. This is an important point for the development of an understanding of the present shape of misrepresentation, as will later appear. It is not just a matter of how to argue quantum on given facts.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

This was false, since half the turnover was achieved by a travelling salesman. The plaintiff made heavy losses from the business, and brought an action in the tort of deceit. He recovered £1500 in damages at first instance. This award was based on the cost of “making good the representation”. The plaintiff appealed, claiming that a proper award, compensating him for all loss sustained through the transaction, was £5500.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that £5500 was the correct quantum of damages. In actions for breach of contract the principle of foreseeability of loss applied to limit recovery by reference to what was within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made.

He sold one of them to the plaintiff, fraudulently representing to her that he had no intention of working at the other, but that he intended to set up business abroad. In fact he went on to work full-time at the second salon, and a number of his clients followed him there. The plaintiff ran the business at a loss until she managed to sell it, some years later, for much less than she had paid for it. At first instance the plaintiff received damages for the fall in the value of the business, the expenses of buying and selling it, the trading losses, improvements carried out in an attempt to make it more profitable, loss of profits and general damages for disappointment and inconvenience.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal allowed the defendant&#8217;s appeal in part, reducing the damages awarded for loss of profits. Counsel for the defendant had submitted that loss of profits was not recoverable except in an action for breach of a contractual warranty as to what the profits would be. That submission was rejected, but it was nevertheless held that the trial judge had assessed loss of profits on a misconceived basis. He had considered the profit which might have been made had the plaintiff operated the salon without the defendant in close competition.

Damages will not be awarded for the profits which would have been made through the business had there been no misrepresentation. That second and incorrect head of damage would involve treating the fraudulent misrepresentation as if it were a contractual promise which had been breached.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The correct measure of damage is therefore reliance loss, not expectation loss.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Ogden counterclaimed for damages. Ogden had been preparing a tender to undertake excavation work. For this, barges were needed to transport earth for dumping at sea, and the price at which Ogden tendered was highly sensitive to the carrying capacity of the barges to be used. Howard&#8217;s employee, Mr O&#8217;Loughlin, stated the correct carrying capacity of the barges in cubic metres. He also gave the deadweight capacity as about 1600 tons. He had seen a figure somewhat above this in Lloyd&#8217;s Register. Exceptionally, Lloyd&#8217;s Register was wrong. The deadweight given by the manufacturer of the barges was 1050 tons. Mr O&#8217;Loughlin had also seen this figure, but had preferred to rely on Lloyd&#8217;s Register. Ogden based their counterclaim on collateral contract, or section 2(1) negligent misrepresentation, or negligent misstatement, in the alternative.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held by a majority that negligent misstatement failed here, and that section 2(1) negligent misrepresentation succeeded. All three judges were in agreement that there was no collateral contract.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Bridge LJ drew a distinction between the approach taken by the judge at first instance, and the approach required by section 2(1) of the 1967 Act:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“It is unfortunate that the judge never directed his mind to the question whether Mr O&#8217;Loughlin had any reasonable ground for his belief. The question he asked himself, in considering liability under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, was whether the innocent misrepresentation was negligent. He concluded that if Mr O&#8217;Loughlin had given the inaccurate information in the course of the April telephone conversation he would have been negligent to do so but that in the circumstances obtaining at the Otley interview in July there was no such negligence. I take it that he meant by this that on the earlier occasions the circumstances were such that he would have been under a duty to check the accuracy of his information, but that on later occasions he was exempt from any such duty. I appreciate the basis of this distinction, but it seems to me, with respect, quite irrelevant to any question of liability under the statute. If the representee proves a misrepresentation which, if fraudulent, would have sounded in damages, the onus passes immediately to the representor to prove that he had reasonable ground to believe the facts represented. In other words the liability of the representor does not depend upon his being under a duty of care the extent of which may vary according to the circumstances in which the representation is made. In the course of negotiations leading to a contract the statute imposes an absolute obligation not to state facts which the representor cannot prove he had reasonable ground to believe.<br>&emsp;&emsp;[I]t is to be assumed that Mr O&#8217;Loughlin was perfectly honest throughout. But the question remains whether his evidence, however benevolently viewed, is sufficient to show that he had an objectively reasonable ground to disregard the figure in the ship&#8217;s documents and to prefer the Lloyd&#8217;s Register. I think it is not. The fact that he was more interested in cubic capacity could not justify reliance on one figure of deadweight capacity in preference to another”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Negligence in tort is the failure to exercise the level of care which a situation demands. The fault which section 2(1) requires to be disproved is strictly speaking something else, and the more burdensome to disprove, because it is free of context and therefore absolute. The situation affords no qualifications or circumstantially-founded excuses.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, the words “had reasonable ground to believe and did believe” tend to a similar conclusion. It is possible to envisage <i>negligence</i> being disproved simply by showing a reasonable ground for belief in the truth of what was said, even if positive belief in truth could not also be shown. For instance, a representation of law might be made about the status of a lease. Leaving out of account the problem that it might shade into opinion, perhaps the most that even (or perhaps particularly) an assiduous lawyer might feel able to affirm would be reasonable grounds for the advice, stopping short of positive belief. For the discharge of the burden shifted to the defendant by section 2(1), however, that is not enough.<br>&emsp;&emsp;For these reasons, description of the section 2(1) action as “negligent misrepresentation” is not quite accurate, even though the label is often used and broadly acceptable. A lesser degree of culpability may qualify.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They are also arithmetically and conceptually complex. In brief, a car dealer sold a car on hire purchase, receiving a payment in return from a finance company which was then to recoup a larger sum from the car&#8217;s purchaser. The company would only enter into such transactions where the purchaser had paid a deposit of at least 20% of the purchase price of the car. The car dealer had altered the figures involved in order to misrepresent to the finance company (but for no other motive) that the 20% rule had been complied with although in reality it had not. The purchaser defaulted, and the finance company sued the dealer under section 2(1) of the Act.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal rejected the defendant dealer&#8217;s claim that the loss pleaded by the finance company was too remote. This required the court to decide whether the far-reaching measure of damages for fraud, unlimited by any requirement of foreseeeability, was indeed imported into section 2(1) by the “fiction of fraud”. The court examined academic arguments, including those of <span class="bd">Treitel</span> to the contrary, but concluded that all loss was recoverable for section 2(1) misrepresentation just as it was for fraudulent misrepresentation. Section 2(1) of the Act, in saying “shall be so liable”, means exactly that.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">A curious problem develops if one considers section 2(1) further (but if you feel you do not need a curious problem at this point, feel free to skip the remainder of this paragraph). <span class="bd">McKendrick</span> describes the decision in Royscot Trust as “extraordinary”, but in fact it, and the statute, do make sense in a bizarre fashion. After all, if the defendant is unable to show that he believed his representation to be true, as section 2(1) requires of him if he is to have a defence, then the reasoning in Derry v Peek labels his misrepresentation fraudulent. He did not believe it to be true. No wonder he is to be liable as if he were fraudulent. Although section 2(1) cannot seriously be thought to create a statutory version of fraudulent misrepresentation with the burden of proof reversed, its drafting seems to cause it to overlap with Lord Herschell&#8217;s definition of fraud.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In fact the next case provides some authority against taking this line of analysis too far. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It was his intention to use the farm for the raising of prize poultry. The lease imposed on him obligations to pay rents, rates, and to carry out repairs required by the local authority. He installed a flock of poultry and a manager, and discharged his obligations under the lease. In fact the premises were in such a state that the water supply was poisoned. The poultry either died or became valueless, and the farm manager fell ill. The plaintiff claimed compensation for the loss of the flock, consequential loss of profits, the manager&#8217;s medical expenses, and for the financial obligations imposed by the lease.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The court held that since damages were not available for innocent misrepresentation, most of these claims failed. An indemnity was awarded to cover the financial obligations imposed by the lease.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;It may seem strange that indemnity is being raised only here, in connection with innocent misrepresentation. Can it be that innocent misrepresentation comes, despite its venial character, with an extra remedy absent from actions for negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation? There is no reason to think so, even though indemnity is only ever discussed in the context of innocent misrepresentation. In actions for the culpable forms of misrepresentation there would almost certainly be a substantive award of damages, and the indemnity would be subsumed by that.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In case the relationship between an indemnity and ordinary damages (whether contractual or tortious) seems arbitrary, it can be explained in this way. The rationale of an indemnity, unlike an award of damages, is not primarily to compensate.

The plaintiff, as a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the fraud, would have obtained good title to the car provided the original owner had not rescinded his contract with the fraudster before the plaintiff acquired the car. The defendant argued that he had validly rescinded the contract in time by giving notice of his intention to do so to the police and the AA.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the contract had been rescinded by this means. Although, in view of modern communications, rescission would normally be deemed to require contact to have been made with the representor, this could not be done if that person had absconded. Provided the representee has established on objective grounds that he has made a final and irrevocable decision to rescind, that is sufficient.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The following remarks are highly technical, and included here only to address any concern which some may feel over the relationship between rescission and termination. As usual, there is no requirement to read them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;How does termination of contract relate to rescission? In the glossary at the head of the first lecture on misrepresentation, and prior to that, it has been suggested that termination for breach of condition stops a contract in its tracks, while rescission is as stated above. In other words, they are to be rigorously differentiated. The difficulty is that termination of contract in the context of the sale or supply of goods can now be seen to look puzzlingly like rescission. Breach of condition prima facie entitles the buyer or transferee to send the goods back and claim for the price. Yet this is never called “rescission”, and the idea of rescission for breach of contract makes no sense at all despite the tendency of some judges to use the verb “to rescind” beyond its proper context.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The following is based partly on passages in the texts of <span class="bd">Treitel</span>, Cheshire &amp; Fifoot, and Anson on Contract, and partly on independent analysis. A buyer or transferee acquiring goods which breach a condition of the contract does indeed “terminate performance” through refusing to pay. If no payment is to be made for the goods, then they must be returned, or the buyer/transferee will have been unjustly enriched. If payment has already been made, then the subsequent return of the goods triggers a “total failure of consideration” since that party is now left without either the goods or the expenditure made to acquire them. The buyer/ transferee has nothing to show for the payment made. That subjects the other party to a restitutionary obligation to refund the payment.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This looks like rescission. In fact, it is a combination of termination of contract with restitutionary principles.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(2) Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him otherwise than fraudulently, and he would be entitled, by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract, then, if it is claimed, in any proceedings arising out of the contract, that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded, the court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, if of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party.<br>&emsp;&emsp;(3) Damages may be awarded against a person under subsection (2) of this section whether or not he is liable to damages under subsection (1) thereof, but where he is so liable any award under the said subsection (2) shall be taken into account in assessing his liability under the said subsection (1).<br>&emsp;&emsp;Section 2(2) is clumsily drafted, but comprehensible in at least most of its effects. Once again, like section 2(1) it refers to fraudulent misrepresentation, but here does so only to affirm that fraudulent misrepresentation is beyond its reach.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation, rescission is available as of right, providing it is not barred by any of the common law obstacles considered below.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the case of non-fraudulent misrepresentation (negligent or innocent), the Act gives the court a discretion. The court may refuse to allow rescission. In place of rescission, it may make an award of damages to reflect the fact that the claimant is to be permanently saddled with the contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;For negligent misrepresentation, the damages awarded in the tort of deceit (on the fiction of fraud) may be supplemented by a further award to reflect the fact that the court has disallowed rescission.<br>&emsp;&emsp;For innocent misrepresentation, an award of damages to reflect the fact that the court has disallowed rescission will be the only compensatory award, though it may be joined with a reimbursing indemnity as discussed earlier.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This is the situation produced by the subsection (though the foregoing explanation does not address at least one of the finer points). The main question is when a court will exercise its discretion to refuse rescission for negligent or innocent misrepresentation, giving damages in lieu. The next case is the leading authority.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Before the auction took place, the auctioneers had told the defendants that the local authority had no plans for the property and were not likely to seek compulsory purchase of it. After the defendants had secured the property at auction, they were told by the local authority that it was to be included in a slum clearance scheme. The auctioneers&#8217; conditions of sale included the clause: “The vendors do not make or give and neither the auctioneers nor any person in the employment of the auctioneers has any authority to make or give any representation or warranty in relation to [the property]”. The defendants argued that this clause should be understood as one excluding liability for misrepresentation, and that it was therefore to be subject to the test of reasonableness.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The court held that the clause was not to be understood in this way.

It was one thing for a principal, as in <i>Overbrooke v Glencombe</i>, to limit his agents&#8217; authority to make representations.

If in context a statement contains no assertion, express or implied, that its content is accurate, there is no representation. Ergo, there can be no misrepresentation; ergo the Misrepresentation Act 1967 cannot apply to it. Humpty Dumpty would have fallen for this argument. If we were to fall for it, the Misrepresentation Act would be dashed to pieces which not all the King&#8217;s lawyers could put together again”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The defendants refused to accept the consignment, and the plaintiff brought an action for damages. The question for the court was whether it was permissible, in terms of evidence and substance, for the defendants to plead at trial that they understood the contract as referring to the ship <i>Peerless</i> sailing from Bombay in October, whereas the plaintiffs had landed cargo only from a second ship, also called <i>Peerless</i>, which had sailed from Bombay in December.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Counsel for the defendants submitted that the case was one of latent ambiguity, so that there was no <i>consensus ad idem</i> and therefore no contract. The court gave judgment for the defendants, without stating reasons for the decision. Nevertheless, in the course of argument Pollock CB intervened to say that the question whether the parties were or were not referring to the same <i>Peerless</i> was a matter of evidence for the jury (and therefore a matter on which a finding of fact should be made at trial).

Where the court has nothing more than the parties&#8217; competing understandings of what their “agreement” was, and no means by which to regard one understanding as more probably the contract&#8217;s true sense than the other, it is hard to resist the conclusion that neither party can prove his version of that agreement to the required standard. The predicament may be more the fault of one than the other, but it would remain essentially arbitrary to reject the culpable party&#8217;s interpretation in order to penalise carelessness. The matter properly turns on proof, not fault.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Nevertheless, there are cases in which discussion of fault seems central to the judgments. At least one of them deserves to be looked at briefly.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He had inspected the land with the plans, and had wrongly concluded that its border was formed by an iron fence on the far side of the trees. In fact the boundary was a row of inconspicuous stumps on the near side of the trees. At first instance a decree of specific performance was made against him. It was discharged on appeal. The court held that the defendant&#8217;s mistake was entirely understandable, that it had been induced in part through the carelessness of the vendors, and that it would not be just to compel specific performance.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The following are the factors which distinguish <i>Denny v Hancock</i> from the cases above. First, it is not a case of mutual mistake. There was a true state of affairs, and the defendant&#8217;s mistaken although understandable view. The case is one of unilateral mistake, and to suggest that the one party meant to buy with the trees and the other party to sell without them is to distort the situation. Secondly, the court is therefore not engaged in preferring one competing account of a contract above another. The question was whether an equitable remedy was to be granted in the court&#8217;s discretion against the defendant, and it was held that the plaintiff&#8217;s culpability here entitled the defendant to be protected from it. Thirdly, the judgment does not necessarily constitute outright victory for the defendant. It is unclear on this point, but it is at least possible, if not probable, that the defendant would still be answerable in damages for his failure to complete the purchase, even though he was not to be ordered by the court to do so.<br>&emsp;&emsp;True cases of mutual mistake are infrequent. Situations which seem amenable to this analysis at first sight will often reveal unilateral mistake as above, where the competing understandings of the contract are a mistaken version (however excusable), and the true version. Even where that is not so, because it does not appear on the face of the contract what its true understanding is, a broad approach to construction, taking into account the whole matrix of fact, will probably tip the balance for or against the claimant.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He had an account with Brocklehurst. In fact Brocklehurst owed him money, so that the defendant would have a set-off against the price of the goods. Unbeknown to the defendant, Brocklehurst had transferred his business to his foreman earlier in the day on which the order arrived. The foreman supplied the goods.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The court held that the defendant had intended to contract with Brocklehurst, to whom his offer had been exclusively made. The foreman was not able to substitute himself as offeree, thereby depriving the defendant of the benefit of his set-off. Since there was therefore no contract between the foreman and the defendant, the foreman could not sue for the price of the goods.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">Bramwell</span> B: “It is an admitted fact, that the defendant supposed he was dealing with Brocklehurst; and the plaintiff misled him by executing the order unknown to him. It is clear also, that if the plaintiff were at liberty to sue, it would be a prejudice to the defendant, because it would deprive him of a set-off, which he would have had if the action had been brought by the party with whom he supposed we was dealing. And upon that my judgment proceeds. I do not lay it down that because a contract was made in one person&#8217;s name another person cannot sue upon it, except in cases of agency. But when one makes a contract in which the personality, so to speak, of the particular party contracted with is important for any reason, whether because it is to write a book or paint a picture, or do any work of personal skill, or whether because there is a set-off due from that party, no one else is at liberty to step in and maintain that he is the party contracted with, that he has written the book or painted the picture, or supplied the goods; and that he is entitled to sue, although, had the party really contracted with sued, the defendant would have had the benefit of his personal skill, or of a set-off due from him. As to the difficulty suggested, that if the plaintiff cannot sue for the price of the goods, no one else can, I do not feel pressed by it any more than I did in such a case as I may suppose, of work being done to my house, for instance, by a party different from the one with whom I had contracted to do it. The defendant has, it is true, had the goods; but it is also true that he has consumed them and cannot return them. And that is no reason why he should pay money to the plaintiff which he never contracted to pay, but upon some contract which he never made, and the substitution of which for that which he did make would be to his prejudice, and involve a pecuniary loss by depriving him of a set-off”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This decision is very obviously unfair to the plaintiff. Nevertheless, he would probably have been able to bring an action in the tort of conversion against the defendant, and the fact that the goods no longer existed would have been no obstacle to the recovery of damages. The modern law would provide a restitutionary remedy to prevent the defendant&#8217;s unjust enrichment.<br>&emsp;&emsp;However, the main point, for present purposes, is that the “capture” of an offer by one to whom it was never directed will result in a mismatch between offer and purported acceptance so that no contract comes into being. Another way of putting it, despite the logical problem involved with this form of words, is that the contract is void.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He then ordered large quantities of handkerchiefs from the plaintiffs, who were linen manufacturers in Belfast. A well-known and respected company called William Blenkiron &amp; Sons carried on business at 123, Wood Street. When ordering the handkerchiefs, Blenkarn signed himself “A. Blenkarn &amp; Co”, in order to take the benefit of Blenkiron &amp; Sons&#8217; presumed creditworthiness and obtain the goods without having to pay for them up front. The firm of Blenkiron &amp; Sons was known to the plaintiffs. They corresponded with the fraudster addressing letters to him as “Messrs Blenkiron and Co”. Blenkarn had been signing his name so that it would readily appear to be “Blenkiron”. He obtained the goods on credit, sold them on to innocent third party buyers, and one of the latter was later sued in conversion by the plaintiffs when Blenkarn failed to pay his debt.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held that the plaintiffs&#8217; action succeeded. No contract had come into existence. The plaintiffs and Blenkarn had never come into contact personally. Therefore the identity of the parties to the purported contract was to be deduced from the correspondence.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Cairns, the Lord Chancellor, explained the conclusion to which that analysis led:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“If that is so, what is the consequence? It is that Blenkarn – the dishonest man, as I call him, - was acting here just in the same way as if he had forged the signature of Blenkiron &amp; Co, the respectable firm, to the applications for goods, and as if, when, in return, the goods were forwarded and letters were sent, accompanying them, he had intercepted the goods and intercepted the letters, and had taken possession of the goods, and of the letters which were addressed to, and intended for, not himself but, the firm of Blenkiron &amp; Co. Now, my Lords, stating the matter shortly in that way, I ask the question, how is it possible to imagine that in that state of things any contract could have arisen between the respondents and Blenkarn, the dishonest man? Of him they knew nothing, and of him they never thought. With him they never intended to deal. Their minds never, even for an instant of time rested upon him, and as between him and them there was no consensus of mind which could lead to any agreement or any contract whatever. As between him and them there was merely the one side to a contract, where, in order to produce a contract, two sides would be required. With the firm of Blenkiron &amp; Co of course there was no contract, for as to them the matter was entirely unknown, and therefore the pretence of a contract was a failure.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The result, therefore, my Lords, is this, that your Lordships have not here to deal with one of those cases in which there is <i>de facto</i> a contract which may afterwards be impeached and set aside, on the ground of fraud; but you have to deal with a case which ranges itself under a completely different chapter of law, the case namely in which the contract never comes into existence. The property remained, as it originally had been, the property of the respondents, and the title which was attempted to be given to the appellants was a title which could not be given to them”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Since this is the first of a considerable line of fraud cases which have to be presented here, it would be as well to pause for reflection on the situation (not for further analysis of it). The parties to litigation of this sort are both innocent. What might the law aim to do in this situation? Prioritise the protection of the defrauded seller, or the innocent third party purchaser? Should the answer in fact vary to reflect differences in the facts? Would that lead to unacceptable uncertainty? Would the best course be to apportion the loss between the seller and third party? Or is the best course to let the legal result depend, as it does, on the distinction between a void and a voidable contract? The path taken by the law is currently the last of these.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
	<div class='back bigbox bigbox-b' id='box-372'> <div style='case-details-container'><div class='details details-title'>Mistake - Unilateral Mistake - Fraud Cases</div><div class='details details-facts'><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Overview</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;A fraudster called Wallis obtained a quotation for brass rivet wire from King&#8217;s Norton Metal Co Ltd, and later the goods themselves. He represented that he was carrying on business as “Hallam &amp; Co” of Sheffield, and used headed paper which included a design showing a large factory with a number of chimneys, and a statement that Hallam &amp; Co had depots and agencies in Belfast, Lille and Ghent. It appeared that Wallis had previously ordered goods in the same way and paid for them with a cheque drawn on “Hallam &amp; Co”. On this occasion, when Wallis received the goods, he did not pay for them but sold them on to Edridge. The plaintiffs sued Edridge in the tort of conversion. The judge at first instance held that they could not maintain this action, since property in the goods had passed to Wallis and so to Edridge.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal upheld this ruling. The question was, with whom did the plaintiffs intend to contract? The only possible answer was that they intended to contract with the writer of the letters. If it could have been shown that there was a separate and real entity called “Hallam &amp; Co”, the case might have been governed by <i>Cundy v Lindsay</i>. Cave J identified the device used by Wallis as a “long firm fraud”, and asked rhetorically whether anybody had ever heard of an attempt being made by a person who had delivered goods to a “long firm” to get his goods back on the ground that he had made no contract with the long firm. The remedy on these facts lay in fraud, but property had passed to the fraudster under a voidable contract and so on to the innocent third party.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;A “long firm fraud” is of course one in which the fraudster builds confidence by paying, but with a view to a later default on his credit.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This case is authority for the proposition that where the fraudster proceeds by the adoption of a purely invented identity, the contract will be found to be with the fraudster. It is currently regarded as good law.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It is difficult to accept that such a clear distinction can be logically drawn. If the question is “for whom was the plaintiff&#8217;s offer meant?”, then to answer by reference to the fact that it must have been Wallis since “Hallam &amp; Co” did not exist is to short-circuit a proper analysis. The test should be one of objective appearance. On the objective appearance of the paperwork here, the plaintiff&#8217;s contractual partner was to be “Hallam &amp; Co”. One wonders whether the rule in King&#8217;s Norton Metal v Edridge may be meant to teach a lesson. To be duped by the assumption of an identity which has no real existence is to be badly duped, or so it is perhaps natural to suppose. That carelessness prevents the assertion that the assumed identity was so important as to condition the deal. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The problem with this is the usual one. Care or carelessness is not usually a determinative factor in the analysis of contract formation, and it should not be here. It is at most some evidence tending to qualify the importance or otherwise of the question of identity to the deal. What is more, it would be rash to suppose that a person duped in these circumstances will always have been particularly careless. A fraud of the type in King&#8217;s Norton may actually be extremely sophisticated and liable to take in the most vigilant. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The following trio of cases concern face-to-face dealings. As stated above, here there is a strong presumption that a contract will be found between the parties (seller and fraudster) who were physically present to each other. As the law currently stands, that presumption can be rebutted. Unfortunately the case which illustrates successful rebuttal is almost universally regarded as indistinguishable on its facts from others in which the presumption was not rebutted. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

As he wrote out and signed a cheque for the total, he said to the plaintiff “You see who I am, I am Sir George Bullough”, and gave an address in St James&#8217;s Square. The plaintiff had heard of Sir George Bullough, and consulted a directory to check the address given. He asked North if he would like to take the articles with him; North replied that the plaintiff had better let the cheque clear first, but that he would like to take the ring with him since it was his wife&#8217;s birthday the following day. He took the ring, and pledged it with a pawnbroker who gave him £350 for it. His cheque was dishonoured.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail </span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The basis for this decision was explained by Horridge J: “I have carefully considered the evidence of the plaintiff, and have come to the conclusion that, although he believed the person to whom he was handing the ring was Sir George Bullough, he in fact contracted to sell and deliver it to the person who came into his shop, and who was not Sir George Bullough, but a man in the name of North, who obtained the sale and delivery by means of the false pretence that he was Sir George Bullough. It is quite true the plaintiff in re-examination said he had no intention of making any contract with any other person than Sir George Bullough; but I think I have myself to decide what is the proper inference to draw where a verbal contract is made and an article delivered to an individual describing himself as somebody else…”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The correctness of this decision is never doubted, but Professor Wade points out one of its troubling aspects. The present state of the law means that the distance seller is relatively protected by comparison with the <i>inter praesentes</i> seller. Arguably, the law&#8217;s protection is misplaced. The distance seller has time to verify the facts on which he relies. The <i>inter praesentes</i> seller is put on the spot.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The reservation mentioned above is based on a policy ground. Arguably, there is a more pressing objection based on principles of contract formation. The fraudster is purporting to accept an offer which he knows cannot represent the true intention of its maker. Why is this not a snapping-up case, disclosing a mismatch of offer and acceptance?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Perhaps the only way of resisting that conclusion is to revisit the snapping-up cases (lecture 2) and recall that the mistake operating there to disrupt offer and acceptance had to relate to the terms of the contract. If Phillips v Brooks is not a wrongly-decided snapping-up case, that must be because the fact of the buyer&#8217;s true identity was not contractual.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">This proposition does seem to be maintainable. The deceit with regard to identity was a vital misrepresentation inducing the contract, but the presumed identity of the buyer was not a term of that contract. This explanation may technically justify the correctness of the two lines of cases, but it seems inadequate on a broader view.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The next case, severely criticized, is one in which the <i>inter praesentes</i> presumption was rebutted in the judgments of the majority of the Court of Appeal.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They were visited by a fraudster, who said that his name was Hutchinson and that he lived in Caterham. After some negotiations, a price of £717 was agreed for the car. “Hutchinson” then produced a cheque book, but Elsie Ingram said that under no circumstances would she take a cheque. That led to a discussion which it later fell to the judge at first instance (Slade J) to interpret. He took the view that the deal failed at this point, since the parties were not <i>ad idem</i> with regard to payment terms. The negotiations resumed; “Hutchinson” gave more information about himself to establish his respectableness, saying that he was P.G.M.Hutchinson of Stanstead House, Caterham, and that he had local business interests. Hilda Ingram meanwhile went to the post office to check that there was a person of that name living at that address. Since there was, the vendors parted with the car in return for a cheque which was later dishonoured. They sued a third party recipient of the car in conversion.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal upheld the judgment at first instance, holding by a majority (Devlin LJ dissenting) that no contract had come into existence.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The following passages are taken from the majority judgment of Pearce LJ. A fairly lengthy extract is given in total so that the reasoning behind this now notorious decision can be fairly evaluated.<br>&emsp;&emsp;“At the beginning of the negotiations, always an important consideration, the name or personality of the false Hutchinson were of no importance and there was no other identity competing with his physical presence. The plaintiffs were content to sell the car for cash to any purchaser. The contractual conversation was orally addressed to the physical identity of the false Hutchinson. The identity was the man present, and his name was merely one of his attributes. Had matters continued thus, there would clearly have been a valid but voidable contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I accept the judge&#8217;s view that there was no contract at the stage when the man pulled out his cheque book. From a practical point of view negotiations reached an impasse at that stage….<br>&emsp;&emsp;Thereafter, the negotiations were of a different kind from what the vendor mistakenly believed them to be hitherto. The parties were no longer concerned with a cash sale of goods where the identity of the purchaser was prima facie unimportant. They were concerned with a credit sale in which both parties knew that the identity of the purchaser was one of the utmost importance. She now realized that she was being asked to give him possession of the car on the faith of his cheque.<br>&emsp;&emsp;This was an important stage of the transaction because it demonstrated quite clearly that she was not prepared to sell on credit to the mere physical man in her drawing-room though he presented himself as a man of substance….<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is not easy to decide whether the vendor was selling to the man in her drawing-room (fraudulently misrepresented as being a man of substance with the attributes of the real Hutchinson) or to P.G.M.Hutchinson of Stanstead House (fraudulently misrepresented as being the man in her drawing-room)….<br>&emsp;&emsp;The judge said: “I have not the slightest hesitation in reaching the conclusion that the offer which the plaintiffs made to accept the cheque of £717 was one made only to, and one which was capable of being accepted by, the honest Hutchinson…”. In view of the experience of the judge and the care which he devoted to the present case, I should hesitate long before interfering with that finding of fact, and I would only do so if compelled by the evidence or by the view that the judge drew some erroneous inference. Where, as here, a borderline case is concerned with ascertaining the intention of the parties, the view of the trial judge who hears the witnesses should not lightly be discarded. I am not persuaded that on the evidence he should have found otherwise”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;For this view to work, it would seem necessary to credit Elsie Ingram with having made the following offer: “The car is for sale on credit to P.G.M.Hutchinson”. It is equally necessary to find that she did <i>not</i> mean “The car is for sale to you on credit (and the reason for my change of mind is that you have convinced me you are honest and will pay)”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Devlin LJ, in his dissenting judgment, based himself on the presumption that a person intends to contract with the individual to whom he is actually speaking. He did not deny that the presumption could be rebutted, but declined to speculate what facts might justify that outcome. He acknowledged that the dividing line between voidness and voidability was a very fine one, but added that the drawing of fine distinctions was not necessarily any reproach to the law. However, he considered that the true spirit of the common law lay in overriding technical distinctions when they stood in the way of doing practical justice. The question in cases such as this was which of two innocent parties was to suffer for another&#8217;s fraud. Devlin LJ proposed that a power to apportion the loss between them could appropriately be introduced by Parliament.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Law Reform Committee considered this proposal in 1966, but rejected it as likely to lead to complex difficulties in practice. It recommended that there should be a general rule for application to cases of mistaken identity; such contracts should be voidable. Parliament did not act.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The next case is invariably cited together with <i>Phillips v Brooks</i> and <i>Ingram v Little</i>, but can be given briefly.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Pursuant to the contract, the company was to receive hire purchase payments from that person, who meanwhile would have the use of the car which he would ultimately buy by this means. In fact the finance company had been induced to enter into the agreement by a fraudster, who had purported to be Durlabh Patel (a real person wholly unconnected with the transaction).

It was clear, taking that approach, that the fraudster was not a party to the agreement. The only person qualified to enter into the agreement with the finance company was the real Durlabh Patel, who had not in reality or in law done so. In the opinion of the minority, however, <i>Cundy v Lindsay</i> led to the drawing of unreasonable and unprincipled distinctions between modes of contract formation, and should be departed from. The finance company&#8217;s contractual partner was the fraudster, so that the contract had been voidable for fraudulent misrepresentation until the time when the fraudster passed the goods on to the innocent third party.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Phillips, in the majority, favoured maintaining the strong presumption that in cases of personal contact, the parties should be deemed to have contracted with each other in their true identities. He explained the relationship between this assumption and the construction-based rule traditionally applied to written contracts. In the latter instance there was no need for the presumption. The contract was to be consulted in order to discover the identity of the parties to it. Since it identified Durlabh Patel as the hirer but had been made without that person&#8217;s authority, it was a nullity and void.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Hobhouse, also in the majority, was of opinion that the identity of the hirer was of fundamental importance to a consumer credit contract, since the hirer&#8217;s creditworthiness was a pre-condition of the company&#8217;s willingness to contract. The checks carried out by the company were specific to the customer named as Durlabh Patel. The company would not have been prepared to contract with a different person whose credit rating it had not checked.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Nicholls, dissenting, said that the legal principles to be applied could not sensibly differ according to the means by which the deal was concluded. In every case the owner of goods agreed to part with them before receiving valid payment. The essence of the transaction was the same in each case, and the law should therefore apply a single analysis (that of <i>Phillips v Brooks</i> and <i>Lewis v Averay</i>).</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Given the views of the majority of their lordships, Shogun Finance does not change the law. Nevertheless, the difference of opinion between Lords Nicholls and Millett (the minority) and Lords Phillips, Hobhouse and Walker (the majority) is real, and begs the question which view is the better or indeed the right one. Material which may be helpful towards tackling that question can be found in the speech of Lord Hobhouse, where he takes it upon himself to summarise “why the argument of the appellant&#8217;s counsel was so mistaken”:</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it"> “The first reason was that they approached the question as if it was simply a matter of sorting out the common law authorities relating to the sale of goods. They did not treat it as a matter of applying a statutory exception to the basic common law rule, nemo dat quod non habet. Further, they did not analyse the structure of the overall transaction and the consumer credit agreement within it. Accordingly, they misrepresented the role of the dealer, wrongly treating him as the contracting agent of the finance company which he was not. They never analysed the terms of the written document and had no regard at all to the offer and acceptance clause it contained which, if there was any contract between a &#8216;debtor&#8217; and the finance company, governed their relationship and which expressly set out the only way in which such a contract could come into existence. They made submissions which contradicted the express written contract and were therefore contrary to principle and long established English mercantile law. They submitted that Cundy v Lindsay (1878) 3 App Cas 459 was wrongly decided and should be overruled, substituting for it a general rule which, in disregard of the document or documents which constitute the agreement (if any), makes everything depend upon a factual enquiry into extraneous facts not known to both of the parties thus depriving documentary contracts of their certainty. They sought to convert a direct documentary contract with the finance company into a face to face oral contract made through the dealer as the contracting agent of the finance company, notwithstanding that the dealer was never such an agent of the finance company. Finally they sought, having by-passed the written contract, to rely upon authorities on oral contracts for the sale of goods, made face to face and where the title to the goods had passed to the &#8216;buyer&#8217;, notwithstanding that this was a documentary consumer credit transaction not a sale and, on any view, no title had ever passed to R. In the result they have invited a review of those authorities by reference to the particular facts of each of them. They have sought to draw your Lordships into a discussion of the evidential tools, eg rebuttable presumptions of fact and the so-called face-to-face &#8216;principle&#8217;, used by judges in those cases to assist them in making factual decisions (see also the dictum of Gresson P in Fawcett v Star Car Sales [1960] NZLR at 413), notwithstanding that the present case concerns the construction of a written contract. They forget that the, presently relevant, fundamental principles of law to be applied - consensus ad idem, the correspondence of the contractual offer and the contractual acceptance, the legal significance of the use of a written contract - are clear and are not in dispute. Inevitably over the course of time there have been decisions on the facts of individual &#8216;mistaken identity&#8217; cases which seem now to be inconsistent; the further learned, but ultimately unproductive, discussion of them will warm academic hearts. But what matters is the principles of law. They are clear and sound and need no revision. To cast doubt upon them can only be a disservice to English law. Similarly, to attempt to use this appeal to advocate, on the basis of continental legal systems which are open to cogent criticism, the abandonment of the soundly based nemo dat quod non habet rule (statutorily adopted) would be not only improper but even more damaging”.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The plaintiff&#8217;s tender of £285 was accepted. Upon consulting a map, the plaintiff found that Jourmand Reef was not marked, and therefore requested precise latitude and longitude.

The parties had not shared a mistaken assumption that the tanker existed. The Commission had warranted that it did, and had breached the contract since it did not exist. The only mistake made by the plaintiffs had been to believe what the Commission had warranted. <i>Couturier v Hastie</i> was explained as a case which by no means led inexorably to the principle which the draftsman of the Sale of Goods Act had taken from it.

A different legal submission may be more compelling in all the circumstances. The crucial fact here is that the Commission was found, through its conduct, to have undertaken the risk that its assumption would be false. The claimant had only the Commission upon which to rely, and could not be judged to have taken on an equal share of the risk. Application of the <i>res extincta</i> doctrine here would have caused injustice. Therefore it was circumvented.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where a contract purports to grant rights to a person who already has those rights, it will be void.

Following a merger of the Niger Company with another business, the services of Bell and Snelling were no longer required, and Lever Brothers agreed to pay them £30,000 and £20,000 each in severance. In fact, both men had speculated privately in cocoa during their employment; this constituted a breach of contract which would have entitled Lever Brothers to dismiss them without paying any compensation. When the company discovered the breaches of contract, it sued Bell and Snelling for fraudulent misrepresentation. At first instance the jury found these allegations were not proven, since it appeared that the breaches of contract had not been present to the minds of the two men when they negotiated their severance (it is for this reason that the case is not one of unilateral mistake as the facts may initially suggest).<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords considered the argument that the severance agreements were void for common mistake. By a bare majority their Lordships held that the mistake made here was not sufficiently fundamental to overcome the contract.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord <span class="bd">Atkin</span> explained his view of the relevant law, and gave examples to illustrate it:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Mistake as to the quality of the thing contracted for raises more difficult questions. In such a case a mistake will not affect assent unless it is the mistake of both parties, and is as to the existence of some quality which makes the thing without the quality essentially different from the thing as it was believed to be. Of course it may appear that the parties contracted that the article should possess the quality which one or other or both mistakenly believed it to possess. But in such a case there is a contract and the inquiry is a different one, being whether the contract as to quality amounts to a condition or a warranty, a different branch of the law…<br>&emsp;&emsp;We are now in a position to apply to the facts of this case the law as to mistake so far as it has been stated. It is essential on this part of the discussion to keep in mind the finding of the jury acquitting the defendants of fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment in procuring the agreements in question. Grave injustice may be done to the defendants and confusion introduced into the legal conclusion unless it is quite clear that in considering mistake in this case no suggestion of fraud is admissible and cannot strictly be regarded by the judge who has to determine the legal issues raised… [O]n the whole I have come to the conclusion that it would be wrong to decide that an agreement to terminate a definite specific contract is void if it turns out that the agreement had already been broken and could have been terminated otherwise. The contract released is the identical contract in both cases, and the party paying for release gets exactly what he bargains for. It seems immaterial that he could have got the same result in another way, or that if he had known the true facts he would not have entered into the bargain. A buys B&#8217;s horse; he thinks the horse is sound and he pays the price of a sound horse; he would certainly not have bought the horse if he had known as the fact is that the horse is unsound. If B has made no representation as to soundness and has not contracted that the horse is sound, A is bound and cannot recover back the price. A buys a picture from B; both A and B believe it to be the work of an old master, and a high price is paid. It turns out to be a modern copy. A has no remedy in the absence of representation or warranty. A agrees to take on lease or to buy from B an unfurnished dwelling-house. The house is in fact uninhabitable. A would never have entered into the bargain if he had known the fact. A has no remedy and the position is the same whether B knew the facts or not, so long as he made no representation or gave no warranty. A buys a roadside garage business from B abutting on a public thoroughfare: unknown to A but known to B, it has already been decided to construct a bypass road which will divert substantially the whole of the traffic from passing A&#8217;s garage. Again A has no remedy. All these cases involve hardship on A and benefit to B, as most people would say, unjustly. They can be supported on the ground that it is of paramount importance that contracts should be observed, and that if parties honestly comply with the essentials of the formation of contracts – ie. agree in the same terms on the same subject matter – they are bound, and must rely on the stipulations of the contract for protection from the effect of facts unknown to them”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Warrington, dissenting, took a diametrically opposed view of the facts:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“The real question, therefore, is whether the erroneous assumption on the part of both parties to the agreements that the service contracts were undeterminable except by agreement was of such a fundamental character as to constitute an underlying assumption without which the parties would never have made the contract they in fact made, or whether it was only a common error affecting the substance of the consideration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is true that the error was not one as to the terms of the service agreements, but it was one which, having regard to the matter on which the parties were negotiating – namely, the terms on which the service agreements were to be prematurely determined and the compensation to be paid therefor, was in my opinion as fundamental to the bargain as any error one can imagine”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Bell v Lever Brothers</i> presents a difficulty for two reasons. The first is entirely clear from the difference between Lords Atkin and Warrington, set out above. On the view of Lord Atkin, the severance agreements could be but were not here overcome by a fundamental common mistake. On the view of Lord Warrington, it was difficult to imagine a more fundamental mistake relating to agreements essentially as to compensation than the one of thinking that compensation was payable when in fact it was not. A great deal of effort has been expended by commentators on research into the facts of <i>Bell</i> (chiefly by Catherine MacMillan) in order to re-assess the correctness of the majority&#8217;s decision. <span class="bd">McKendrick</span> provides a summary.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The second difficulty arises from the examples given by Lord Atkin of common mistakes which would not overcome a contract. One of them – that of the mistakenly attributed painting – is notorious in that it seems to set the bar for common mistake as to subject-matter impossibly high. To the retort that the painting in question is the painting, never mind who painted it and when, the answer must be that that view is hopelessly distant from the reality of people&#8217;s motivation for entering contracts of the type in question. The example appears to come close to stifling the doctrine.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The bank obtained the agreement of Credit du Nord to guarantee Bennett&#8217;s obligation to pay. Security for the contract of guarantee was stated to be the machines. In fact they did not exist and never had done. When Bennett defaulted, the bank sued Credit du Nord on the contract of guarantee.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the High Court <span class="bd">Steyn J</span> gave various grounds for finding in favour of Credit du Nord. His principal reason was that the contract was rendered inoperative because it contained (in his view) either an express or an implied condition precedent that the machines did exist. He went on to explain that if he were wrong about that, he would have decided the case the same way on the basis that the parties&#8217; misapprehension as to the character of the guarantee was fundamental. It was thought to be secured, and in fact was not. This was enough to “render the subject matter of the contract essentially and radically different from the subject matter which the parties believed to exist”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The order in which Steyn J states these grounds of decision is instructive, and explained by him in his judgment. The first question in a case of this type is whether the risk at issue has been allocated by the contract. The finding of an express or implied condition precedent in this contract of guarantee was one means by which that could be shown to have been done. If the risk has been allocated as between the parties, there is no room for a mistake analysis because the contract takes account of the danger of mistake. Mistake is relevant if the risk cannot be held to have been allocated. Steyn J&#8217;s finding as to common mistake in this context can best be understood as an alternative or secondary ratio.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">An understandable confusion lurks within the facts of this case (and in some others on common mistake). Since the machines turned out never to have existed, why was this not simply a case of res extincta? If one considers the contract which was actually the subject of this litigation (the contract of guarantee, not that of sale and lease-back) it will be seen that the subject-matter of that contract was not non-existent machines. It was the promise to underwrite Bennett&#8217;s obligations under the main contract. These obligations continued to exist on any view. The common mistake consisted in thinking that a guarantee was secured by collateral when in reality it was unsecured. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Before the war, the flat had been let to a third party for £140 a year. The block was damaged in the war, and renovated before Solle moved in. Both parties believed (on the basis of counsel&#8217;s advice) that one legal effect of the renovation was to enable the landlord to fix a rent free from any interference by the Rent Acts. The parties later fell out, and Solle brought an action claiming that the rent was statutorily pegged at its previous level. Butcher counterclaimed for rescission of the contract on the ground of common mistake.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held by a majority that the contract should be set aside on the terms that Solle be free either to agree to pay the higher rent under a new lease or to leave. Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> based the court&#8217;s power to do this on <i>Cooper v Phibbs</i>, pointing to the fact that Lord Westbury had used language in that case consistent with the contract there being voidable rather than void. In his Lordship&#8217;s judgment, this equitable jurisdiction had been overlooked by the House of Lords in <i>Bell v Lever Brothers</i>, which might otherwise have been decided differently. <i>Bell</i>, according to Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span>, really decided that the only type of common mistake capable of rendering a contract void at common law was one which had acquired contractual status by being made a condition precedent.

Perhaps the first, often now left out of account, is that it is clever. It deftly exploits the terminological confusion which undoubtedly besets <i>Cooper v Phibbs</i>. His reinterpretation of the ratio of <i>Bell v Lever Brothers</i> is less convincing. In suggesting that the House of Lords in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> overlooked the equitable doctrine of <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway</i>, Lord Denning may be taken to have got away with it. Here, he was again suggesting that the House of Lords overlooked equity, when in fact Lord <span class="bd">Atkin</span> in <i>Bell</i> stated his view of <i>Cooper v Phibbs</i> in terms which considered but ruled out an equitable input into that decision. Lord Denning was arguing against legal facts. They were House of Lords facts, and he was mounting his attack on them from the Court of Appeal.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Solle v Butcher</i> was taken as good law in certain subsequent cases, sometimes despite the expression of judicial doubt but sometimes without any qualms. It had the merit of allowing a more finely-tuned justice to be delivered than did the common law doctrine. Furthermore, the idea that a common mistake made a contract voidable was attractive, because the orthodox view that it makes the contract void is not altogether easily explained. On the other hand, Lord Denning&#8217;s doctrine was less than certain in its application, since it depended on the notion of a common mistake which was fundamental but not so fundamental as the sort of mistake which Lord Atkin had in mind in <i>Bell.</i> Puzzlement at this gave way to condemnation when the Court of Appeal came to reconsider <i>Solle v Butcher</i> in the next case.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The defendants undertook to arrange salvage, and received the names of four ships in the area from an information service. They chartered the<i> “Great Peace”</i>, which belonged to the claimants, believing it to be 35 miles away from the ship in distress. That contract provided for a cancellation fee. The defendants later realized that the “<i>Great Peace”</i> was in fact 410 miles away. They subsequently chartered a nearer vessel and cancelled the contract with the claimants (but did not do so immediately). The claimants sued the defendants for the cancellation fee. The defendants argued that the contract for the charter of the “<i>Great Peace”</i> was either void at common law, or voidable in equity.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Phillips MR delivered judgment on behalf of himself and the other two members of the court (May and Laws LJJ), affirming the first instance judgment of Toulson J. On the facts, the mistake made here was not sufficiently fundamental to engage the common law doctrine of common mistake. The supposed equitable doctrine promulgated by Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span> in the Court of Appeal in <i>Solle v Butcher</i> could not stand with the House of Lords&#8217; decision in <i>Bell v Lever Brothers</i>.

It was unquestionably a common assumption of both parties when the contract was concluded that the two vessels were in sufficiently close proximity to enable the “<i>Great Peace</i>” to carry out the service that she was engaged to perform. Was the distance between the two vessels so great as to confound that assumption and to render the contractual adventure impossible of performance? If so, the appellants would have an arguable case that the contract was void under the principle in <i>Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd.</i> </a<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para163">Toulson J addressed this issue in the following paragraph: </a<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Was the “<i>Great Peace</i>” so far away from the “<i>Cape Providence</i>” at the time of the contract as to defeat the contractual purpose - or in other words to turn it into something essentially different from that for which the parties bargained? This is a question of fact and degree, but in my view the answer is no. If it had been thought really necessary, the “<i>Cape Providence</i>” could have altered course so that both vessels were heading toward each other. At a closing speed of 19 knots, it would have taken them about 22 hours to meet. A telling point is the reaction of the defendants on learning the true positions of the vessels. They did not want to cancel the agreement until they knew if they could find a nearer vessel to assist. Evidently the defendants did not regard the contract as devoid of purpose, or they would have cancelled at once.”<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para165"> [T]he fact that the vessels were considerably further apart than the appellants had believed did not mean that the services that the “<i>Great Peace</i>” was in a position to provide were essentially different from those which the parties had envisaged when the contract was concluded. The “<i>Great Peace</i>” would arrive in time to provide several days of escort service. The appellants would have wished the contract to be performed but for the adventitious arrival on the scene of a vessel prepared to perform the same services. The fact that the vessels were further apart than both parties had appreciated did not mean that it was impossible to perform the contractual adventure. </a<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para166">The parties entered into a binding contract for the hire of the “<i>Great Peace</i>”. That contract gave the appellants an express right to cancel the contract subject to the obligation to pay the ‘cancellation fee&#8217; of 5 days hire. When they engaged the “<i>Nordfarer</i>” they cancelled the “<i>Great Peace</i>”. They became liable in consequence to pay the cancellation fee. There is no injustice in this result. </a<br>&emsp;&emsp;a name="para167">For the reasons that we have given, we would dismiss this appeal”. </a</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;It would of course be possible to quote from this judgment at far greater length to illustrate the means by which Lord Phillips showed <i>Solle v Butcher</i> to be contrary to precedent. This is not the place for it. The subject is a difficult one, and now chiefly of interest from the historical point of view, as suggested at the outset.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Some textbooks suggest (with varying degrees of conviction) that since <i>Great Peace</i> is itself merely a Court of Appeal decision, so that the Supreme Court may in future make its own choice between the two opposing authorities, it is too early to consign <i>Solle v Butcher</i> to history. Whatever may be said in favour of the remedial flexibility which Lord Denning asserted in <i>Solle</i>, it seems extremely improbable that the Supreme Court would turn the clock back and risk the appearance of confusion by preferring the overruled case.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It would be otherwise where a duty was created not by private agreement but by general law. In that case, impossibility of performance without fault would function as an excuse. There would have been no opportunity to bargain for protection to accompany the duty.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The next is a leading case, because it is normally taken to have introduced an express doctrine of frustration into English law. The conceptual basis given for it, however, is no longer favoured.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Because of a shortage of skilled labour, the work took considerably longer and cost the contractors more than had been expected. They claimed that a pre-contractual statement had been incorporated which made the contract subject to adequate labour and materials being available; that the unavailability discharged the contract; and that they were therefore entitled to recover a sum larger than the agreed price by way of quantum meruit action.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held that the statement had not been incorporated, and that the contract had not been frustrated. The possibility of inadequate supplies of labour had been to some extent foreseen, and the risk lay with the contractors. They were in an unfortunate predicament, but it would be a wrong use of the doctrine of frustration to rescue them from it.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Radcliffe took the opportunity to re-examine the conceptual basis of frustration, and criticised the “implied term” theory as hopelessly artificial:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Lord Loreburn [in <i>Tamplin Steamship Co v Anglo-Mexican Petroleum</i> [1916] 2 AC 397] ascribes the dissolution to an implied term of the contract.... This approach is in line with the tendency of English courts to refer all consequences of a contract to the will of those who made it. But there is something of a logical difficulty in seeing how the parties could even impliedly have provided for something which <i>ex hypothesi</i> they neither expected nor foresaw; and the ascription of frustration to an implied term of the contract has been criticised as obscuring the true action of the court <b>which consists in applying an objective rule of the law of contract to the contractual obligations that the parties have imposed upon themselves </b>[emphasis added]. So long as each theory produces the same result as the other, as normally it does, it matters little which theory is avowed.... But it may still be of some importance to recall that, if the matter is to be approached by way of implied term, the solution of any particular case is not to be found by inquiring what the parties themselves would have agreed on had they been, as they were not, forewarned. It is not merely that no one can answer that hypothetical question: it is also that the decision must be given “irrespective of the individuals concerned, their temperaments and failings, their interest and circumstances (<i>Hirji Mulji v Cheong Yue Steamship Co Ltd</i> (1926)). The legal effect of frustration “does not depend on their intention or their opinions, or even knowledge, as to the event”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;By this time it might seem that the parties themselves have become so far disembodied spirits that their actual persons should be allowed to rest in peace. In their place there arises the figure of the fair and reasonable man. And the spokesman of the fair and reasonable man, who represents after all no more than the anthropomorphic conception of justice, is and must be the court itself. So perhaps it would be simpler to say at the outset that frustration occurs wherever the law recognises that without default of either party a contractual obligation has become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract. <i>Non haec in foedera veni</i>. It was not this that I promised to do”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Radcliffe&#8217;s understanding of the foundation of frustration was fully considered and approved by the House of Lords in the next case, which also stands as authority affirming the once doubted proposition that a lease could in theory be frustrated.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The appellants claimed that the lease had been frustrated, and therefore stopped paying rent.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held unanimously that on these facts the lease was not frustrated, but by a majority that frustration of a lease was possible in rare circumstances. This had traditionally been doubted because a lease is an interest in land, which endures notwithstanding events which in fact deprive the lessee of the land&#8217;s practical usefulness. The majority of their lordships were of the view that a rigid distinction between leases on the one hand and all other types of contract on the other would lead to anomalies. On the facts, however, an interruption of some two years to a contract which was to last for 10 was not sufficient to constitute frustration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Russell, dissenting, was of opinion that short of the physical destruction of land, for instance through coastal erosion, a lease could not be frustrated. The bargain between the parties had passed the land and all its disadvantages and advantages to the lessee for the term of the lease.

In fact the vessel was requisitioned and not released until September 1915. The charterer brought an action for non-delivery.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held that the charterparty had been frustrated. The difference between a charter from April to April, and one from September to September (as this would now be) was said to be fundamental in business terms. It seems that freight rates had risen in the interim, so that the owner would have been prejudiced by being held to the original contract.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Can this case be distinguished from <i>Blackburn Bobbin</i>? It seems necessary to conclude that there a single adventure was in issue, whether viewed before or after the change in circumstances (a sale of timber). Here, the House of Lords proceeded to compare two different adventures, separated in time. The ship was the same, and the use which the charterer wished to make of it was presumably unchanged. However, in the prevailing circumstances its charter was now a wholly different business proposition from the one which the parties originally transacted. The distinction is not completely convincing, and it is hard to escape the conclusion that courts may take a more tender view of certain types of dealing (those about which the law has most to say, such as hirings of ships) than they do of others.<br>&emsp;&emsp;There is another feature of <i>Bank Line v Arthur Capel</i> which is important but not very often noticed. The case includes a principled boundary to the reductive argument that a passive contracting party is not concerned with difficulties encountered by his active counterpart. The case included an airing of the argument (once thought correct) that delay will not frustrate a time charter because while the charterer&#8217;s interest may be affected, the shipowner is interested only in receiving hire for the vessel. The House of Lords preferred the view that the “common object” of such a contract – and presumably other types of contract as well – is to be found in the exchange of services for payment. If an interruption makes it impossible for the ship to provide the contemplated services, that is deemed to affect the interests of both parties.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It is surprising that this principle is not better known. Possibly it has been obscured or even put in some doubt by a series of cases in which its application leads to seemingly inconsistent conclusions. The two best known from this line of cases are given below. In common with several others, they arose from the postponement of the coronation of King Edward VII when the king suffered a bout of appendicitis.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

He spoke to the housekeeper at the premises, who pointed out to him how good the view was. A contract for the hire of the rooms on 26 and 27 June was then concluded in writing. It did not mention the processions. The defendant paid £25 in advance, and agreed to pay £50 on 24 June. When the processions were postponed, the plaintiff sued for £50 and the defendant counterclaimed for the return of the £25 (a claim later withdrawn).<br>&emsp;&emsp;Vaughan Williams LJ in the Court of Appeal held that the contract was frustrated. It was to be interpreted as a licence to use the rooms for a specific purpose. The coronation procession and the relative position of the rooms were the basis of the contract, both for the lessor and the hirer.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;An example in the judgment of Vaughan Williams LJ has given rise to debate, but is seems defensible:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“It was suggested ... that if a cabman was engaged to take someone to Epsom on Derby Day at a suitable enhanced price for such a journey, say £10, both parties to the contract would be discharged in the contingency of the race at Epsom for some reason becoming impossible; but I do not think this follows, for I do not think that in the cab case the happening of the race would be the foundation of the contract. No doubt the purpose of the engager would be to go to see the Derby, and the price would be proportionately high; but the cab had no special qualifications for the purpose which led to the selection of the cab for this particular occasion. Any other cab would have done as well. Moreover, I think that, under the cab contract, the hirer, even if the race went off, could have said, “Drive me to Epsom; I will pay you the agreed sum; you have nothing to do with the purpose for which I hired the cab,” and that if the cabman refused he would have been guilty of a breach of contract, there being nothing to qualify his promise to drive the hirer to Epsom on a particular day. Whereas in the case of the coronation, there is not merely the purpose of the hirer to see the coronation procession, but it is the coronation procession and the relative position of the rooms which is the basis of the contract as much for the lessor as the hirer; and I think that if the King, before the coronation day and after the contract, had died, the hirer could not have insisted on having the rooms on the days named”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It is possible to doubt this decision by arguing reductively against the “common purpose” doctrine most clearly stated in Bank Line v Arthur Capel. In what sense must the provision of facilities to view the processions be taken to be the lessor&#8217;s purpose as well as that of the hirer? Vaughan Williams LJ emphasises that it is, but nowhere in his judgment is this conclusively shown. How is it possible to ascribe anything more to the lessor than the purpose of getting paid, quite irrespective of the hirer&#8217;s motive for contracting to pay?</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">An answer to this can be based on the distinction between the facts and Vaughan Williams LJ&#8217;s example of the cab to Epsom. There was only one conceivable reason for which 56a Pall Mall was being made available. In the contrasting cab case, there could be many reasons apart from watching the Derby for which the hirer might have wished to go to Epsom. Where there may be a multiplicity of (unexpressed) reasons for one side&#8217;s decision to enter the contract, it would seem arbitrary to identify any one of them as necessarily the shared purpose of the parties. Where, on the other hand, the contract has only one objective beyond its propensity to earn one party a profit, it seems more difficult to isolate that party from the other&#8217;s sole objective. Nevertheless, this is ultimately a matter of policy, which is why the clear statement of the law&#8217;s policy in Bank Line v Arthur Capel is so helpful.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

His intention was to take passengers on board for payment. A deposit of £50 was paid, with another £200 to be payable before sailing. The review was cancelled in consequence of the king&#8217;s illness, but the fleet remained anchored off Spithead on the two days in question. When the cancellation was announced, the plaintiff wired to the defendant “What about Cynthia? She ready to start six tomorrow”, but received no reply. The plaintiff sued for £200.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that the contract was not frustrated and that the plaintiff was entitled to that sum less profits made on substituted sailings on the two days. There was no particular connection between the <i>Cynthia</i> and the purpose of the contract; other ships would have done as well. Vaughan Williams LJ therefore regarded this case as covered by his cab to Epsom example.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;It has been pointed out that these cases cannot reliably be distinguished on the presence or absence of unique qualities fitting the contact&#8217;s subject matter to the achievement of the contract&#8217;s purpose; there may have been as many suitable rooms with views along the route of the coronation processions as there were suitable ships in the vicinity of Spithead. The key to justifying the contrasting decisions in these cases (and in the cab example) is surely multiplicity of contractual purposes. There was every reason to pay to cruise around the fleet at anchor even without the naval review, as contemporary commentators attest, just as there may have been many reasons to hire a cab to Epsom despite the cancellation of the Derby. There could only, realistically, have been one reason for a 48 hour hiring of the rooms at 56a Pall Mall.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Can it be that the defence of frustration of the adventure depends on the owner&#8217;s ability to prove that all his servants on board were navigating the ship with adequate skill and that there was no “default” which brought about the catastrophe? Suppose that a vessel in convoy is torpedoed by the enemy and sinks immediately with all hands. Does the application of the doctrine require that the owners shall affirmatively prove that those on board were keeping a good look-out, were obscuring lights, were steering as directed, and so forth?

This voyage would naturally take the ship through the Suez Canal. When the charterparty was negotiated, the parties were aware of a risk that the canal might be closed. They were unable to agree on a provision to meet the risk. The contract nevertheless contained a clause which forbade the charterers from taking the ship into a “dangerous zone” without the permission of the owner. The <i>Eugenia</i>, in breach of this clause, entered the Suez Canal and became trapped there when the canal was closed. The charterers claimed that the contract was frustrated, not because the ship was trapped (this was self-induced), but because even if she had remained outside the canal the contract would have been radically changed and consequently frustrated. The only sea route to India would now have lain round the Cape of Good Hope.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that the necessity of proceeding round the Cape did not have such an impact on the contract as to frustrate it (other courts hearing cases on similar facts generally reached the same conclusion). The voyage was obviously longer and more expensive than the one contemplated, but the additional time it would take had to be judged against the overall duration of the sailing; seen in this context it was not so excessive as to produce frustration. The cargo was not perishable and the vessel (apart from the fact that she was actually trapped in the canal) would have been ready and able to proceed via the Cape.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;“It has frequently been said that the doctrine of frustration only applies when the new situation is “unforeseen” or “unexpected” or “uncontemplated”, as if that were an essential feature. But it is not so. The only thing that is essential is that the parties should have made no provision for it in their contract. The only relevance of it being “unforeseen” is this: If the parties did not foresee anything of the kind happening, you can readily infer that they have made no provision for it: whereas if they did foresee it, you would expect them to make provision for it. But cases have occurred where the parties have foreseen the danger ahead, and yet made no provision for it in the contract. Such was the case in the Spanish Civil War when a ship was let on charter to the republican government. The purpose was to evacuate refugees. The parties foresaw that she might be seized by the nationalists. But they made no provision for it in their contract. Yet, when she was seized, the contract was frustrated, see <i>W.J.Tatem Ltd v Gamboa</i> [1939] 1 KB 132. So here the parties foresaw that the canal might become impassable: it was the very thing they feared. But they made no provision for it.

It amounts to taking foresight into account as raising a presumption that the contract will be found to have allocated the risk. However, the presumption is rebuttable; the contract, when construed, may be found not to allocate the risk despite the foresight. By contrast, Treitel creates an irrebuttable presumption which he then attenuates. The two positions are not ultimately so very different, but Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span>&#8216;s seems the more straightforward.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Closure of the Suez Canal is now generally dealt with by an express clause in shipping contracts.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The probabilities as to the length of the deprivation and not the certainty arrived at after the event are also material. The question must be considered at the trial as it had to be considered by the parties, when they came to know of the cause and the probabilities of the delay and had to decide what to do. On this the judgments in the above cases substantially agree. Rights ought not to be left in suspense or to hang on the chances of subsequent events. The contract binds or it does not bind, and the law ought to be that the parties can gather their fate then and there. What happens afterwards may assist in showing what the probabilities really were, if they had been reasonably forecasted, but when the causes of frustration have operated so long or under such circumstances as to raise a presumption of inordinate delay, the time has arrived at which the fate of the contract falls to be decided. The fate is dissolution or continuance and, if the charter ought to be held to be dissolved, it cannot be revived without a new contract. The parties are free”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;This aspect of the assessment of frustration is a prime example of the way in which English law, at its best, strives to keep close to the way reasonable people in commerce actually react in real situations. It does not seek to trump their decisions made, inevitably, without the benefit of hindsight.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Nor does it force the making of decisions where there is so little information that it would be rash to reach a judgment. Various cases, such as <i>Pioneer Shipping Ltd v BTP Dioxide Ltd, The Nema</i> [1981] 2 All ER 1030 show that where a situation is too unclear to call, the courts will allow the parties to wait until a sensible commercial prognosis can be made before they decide for (or against) frustration. This contrasts with the impression which could very fairly be derived from the cases on self-inducement, where it seemed that frustration had to arise automatically and without the interposition of any choice. In cases of delay, that is simply not the attitude of the courts, since it would place the parties in an intolerable position.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The next case is not a vital one as far as the law is concerned. It is dealt with here at length because it gives a particularly vivid insight into the way in which frustration is handled by the Commercial Court in what is perhaps the one setting where it sometimes features largely – the interruption of charterparties by war.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It also gives an indication that many frustration “rules” within this area are actually deduced from the awards of arbitrators who, as Mustill J explains below, are not expected to explain their decisions in the same way as judges. The excerpts below can be read through quite quickly, because the point is not to pore over the dates but to appreciate (a) how grass-roots adjudication applies the concept of frustration, and (b) how commercial judges defer to the arbitrator&#8217;s role.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The ship sailed to North America to load a cargo of grain, and then to the Iraqi port of Basrah at the head of the Shatt al-Arab waterway, docking there on 14 September 1980. On 22 September open war broke out between Iran and Iraq over control of the Shatt al-Arab. On 1 October the <i>Chrysalis</i> completed unloading and was ready to sail to Muscat, but the Shatt al-Arab was the focus of active conflict between the belligerents and was already blocked by sunken vessels. On 14 November the charterers purported to cancel the charterparty (in order to avoid paying any more hire for the ship). By 24 November it was the view of most informed people in shipping circles that the waterway would remain dangerous for several more months, if not longer. A dispute arose between the parties; the shipowners claimed that the charterparty was not frustrated until 24 November, while the charterers contended that the charterparty had in fact been automatically frustrated by the declaration of war between the belligerents on 22 September. The dispute was referred to arbitration, the arbitrator holding that the date of frustration was 24 November. In his view this was the point at which to continue to hold the parties to the contract would be to impose on them radically different obligations from those they had undertaken. The charterers appealed.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the Commercial Court, Mustill J held that the arbitrator&#8217;s award was not open to criticism. A declaration of war did not automatically frustrate affected contracts. Instead, there was a rebuttable legal presumption that a war would continue for an indefinite period. The arbitrator&#8217;s choice of 24 November as the date on which frustration took place was within a permissible range, and it was not necessary for him to spell out the precise reasons for his choice. To hold otherwise would be to mistake the nature of an arbitrator&#8217;s award.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Mustill J stated that he would quote from the arbitrator&#8217;s award at length, rather than risk distorting it by compressing it:<br>&emsp;&emsp;10. “By the third week of October a number of the trapped vessels at Basrah had suffered physical damage from military action. The foreign crew members of them were being repatriated and arrangements were being made for substitute crew members to be placed on board. By then it had become widely felt that there would be no quick victory for either side. The prospects of a settlement also receded, both sides being apparently unyielding if not fanatical. Nevertheless, during the ensuing days and months attempts were made (notably by the U.N.Envoy, Mr Olaf Palme) to negotiate a cease-fire, or at all events the release of the several score foreign vessels trapped in the Shatt al-Arab. At first hopes of their release were quite high. On 14<sup>th</sup> October, 1980, it had been reported that Iran had expressed willingness to cooperate in freeing the ships. By 27<sup>th</sup> October, 1980 Iraq, for its part appears to have indicated that it would be willing to allow the vessels to leave if they did so under the auspices of the International Red Cross flag (it was not until the end of December that it emerged that the Red Cross were not at that stage willing to lend their support to this).<br>&emsp;&emsp;11. On 14<sup>th</sup> November, 1980 the charterers purported without prejudice to the question of frustration to cancel the charterparty under Clause 42. By 24<sup>th</sup> November, 1980, various peace bids had been rejected, and it became clear beyond reasonable doubt that the war would not end rapidly. On that date Mr Olaf Palme expressed the opinion that there would be no rapid end to the war. A struggle of indefinite duration now seemed inevitable. There remained, it is true, some possibility that without further inordinate delay the trapped vessels might, despite this, be allowed by the belligerents to depart if they could. They were still precluded from sailing by the Iraqi authorities on any conditions which the vessels were in a position to satisfy. In addition already by that date it had become necessary that the river be dredged and cleared of sunken craft before it could be safely navigated. Whether either side would be willing to undertake this at its own expense, or to allow the other to undertake it, and how long such operations would take, were all wholly uncertain. By 24<sup>th</sup> November 1980 it was the view of most informed people in shipping circles that the obstacles were such that vessels were unlikely to be able safely to leave for several more months at best, and probably much longer”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Mustill J explained that the only basis on which the arbitrator&#8217;s choice of 24 November could be challenged was if it was wrong in law (a supervisory jurisdiction). He went on to consider other cases which had arisen out of the same conflict:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“This is not the only Shatt al-Arab dispute in which an arbitrator&#8217;s award has been before the court.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Evia</i> ... concerned a time charter for a period of 18 months, two months more or less. By the beginning of October 1980 it had between six and ten months left to run, depending on how the option would have been exercised. The vessel had completed discharge on 22 November 1980. The arbitrator held that the charter was frustrated on 4 October. The House of Lords declined to intervene.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In <i>International Sea Traders Inc v Hemisphere Shipping Co Ltd, The Wenjiang</i> ... the charterparty was for 12 months, one month more or less, and had four to six months left of the charter period to run at the beginning of October 1980. The arbitrator held that the contract was frustrated on 24 November. An appeal against this decision was dismissed by <span class="bd">Bingham J</span>.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Finally, in <i>Uni-Ocean Lines Pte Ltd v C-Trade SA, The Lucille</i> ... the arbitrators held that the charter was frustrated on 9 December. The contract was a time charter, which had been running since 14 July 1980. It is not clear how long the charter was to continue.... Discharge was completed on 23 October. The charterers sought leave to appeal against the award, on the ground that 24 November [sic: read 9 December?] was too late, and that 23 October was the right date. Parker J declined to grant leave”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Towards the end of his judgment, Mustill J dealt firmly with a subsidiary objection made by the charterers to the arbitral award:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“The second general question relates to the submission made by counsel for the charterers that the award is open to objection because the arbitrator has not given reasons for what he (the arbitrator) described as his visceral reaction. I cannot accept this at all.... [T]he argument is, in my view, misconceived. The whole point of the judgmental task performed at the third stage of the arbitrator&#8217;s process of thought [his making of a decision in light of the ascertained facts and law] is that it does not and indeed cannot involve detailed ratiocination and the very reason why the parties choose arbitration is that they prefer the “hunch” or “feel” or call it what one will of the arbitrator to that of the court. To force the arbitrator to give reasons for a conclusion which in truth is not reasoned would merely create opportunities for an exercise in spurious logic. The court does, I have said, retain a supervisory control, so as to make sure that the arbitrator&#8217;s reaction to the problem is not based on a false premise of law. Beyond this it must not go”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

Here, the contract for the hire of a room to view the procession made the fee of £141 15s payable immediately. The hirer had paid £100 on account. When the procession was cancelled, the hirer sued to recover the £100 as on a total failure of consideration. The defendant counterclaimed for £41 15s.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal held that the claim failed and the counterclaim succeeded. Everything done pursuant to a contract up to the time of its discharge by frustration was to be treated as “rightly done”. Here, the contract had required the hirer to pay before the date of the procession. It had therefore passed to him the risk that the procession might not take place and that he would have spent his money to no good.

One third of the contract price was payable in advance (in fact £1000, somewhat less than a third, was actually paid). On 3 September Britain declared war on Germany, and on 23 September Gdynia was occupied by the German Army. The contract was therefore frustrated. The London agent of the Polish company requested repayment of the £1000. The English company refused on the basis that considerable work had already been done. The High Court and the Court of Appeal held in favour of the English company, applying <i>Chandler v Webster</i>.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords allowed the Polish company&#8217;s appeal, and overruled <i>Chandler v Webster</i>. In the opinion of Lord Simon, a distinction was to be drawn between what could constitute consideration with regard to contract formation, and what constituted it in the law of total failure of consideration (this distinction has since been doubted). The mere promise of consideration was viewed as consideration in the first context, but should not be so regarded in the second context. Furthermore, to allow a restitutionary claim for total failure of consideration was possible whilst preserving the principle that everything done up to the moment of frustration was rightly done and not to be unsettled. It was not an action which purported to be based on the contract, but an action outside the contract.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

A number of visits were to be made each night, seven days of the week. The weekly charge was low: £8 15s. One of the clauses in the contract stated that “under no circumstances shall [Securicor] be responsible for any injurious act or default by any employee of [Securicor] unless such act or default could have been foreseen and avoided by the exercise of due diligence on the part of [Securicor] as his employer...”. One of Securicor&#8217;s duty employees, in the course of a visit to the premises, decided to light a fire by throwing a match onto some cartons. The fire got out of control, and burnt down a substantial part of Photo Productions&#8217; premises, causing damage amounting to £615,000. Photo Productions sued for damages. Securicor relied on its clause.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held that the exemption applied notwithstanding the gravity of the breach.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord <span class="bd">Diplock</span> said the following about the relationship between the contract&#8217;s express terms and the remedies which arise on their breach:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“A basic principle of the law of contract, to which there are no exceptions that are relevant in the instant case, is that parties to a contract are free to determine for themselves what primary obligations they will accept. They may state these in express words in the contract itself and, where they do, the statement is determinative; but in practice a commercial contract never states all the primary obligations of the parties in full; many are left to be incorporated by implication of law from the legal nature of the contract into which the parties are entering. But if the parties wish to reject or modify primary obligations which would otherwise be so incorporated, they are fully at liberty to do so by express words.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Leaving aside those comparatively rare cases in which the court is able to enforce a primary obligation by decreeing specific performance of it, breaches of primary obligations give rise to substituted or secondary obligations on the part of the party in default, and, in some cases, may entitle the other party to be relieved from further performance of his own primary obligations.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Every failure to perform a primary obligation is a breach of contract. The secondary obligation on the part of the contract breaker to which it gives rise by implication of the common law is to pay monetary compensation to the other party for the loss sustained by him in consequence of the breach; but, with two exceptions, the primary obligations of both parties so far as they have not yet been performed remain unchanged. This secondary obligation to pay compensation (damages) for non-performance of primary obligations I will call the “general secondary obligation”. It applies in the cases of the two exceptions as well.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The exceptions are: (1) Where the event resulting from the failure by one party to perform a primary obligation has the effect of depriving the other party of substantially the whole benefit which it was the intention of the parties that he should obtain from the contract, the party not in default may elect to put an end to all primary obligations of both parties remaining unperformed.... (2) Where the contracting parties have agreed, whether by express words or by implication of law, that any failure by one party to perform a particular primary obligation (“condition” in the nomenclature of the Sale of Goods Act 1893), irrespective of the gravity of the event that has in fact resulted from the breach, shall entitle the other party to elect to put an end to all primary obligations of both parties remaining unperformed....<br>&emsp;&emsp;Where such an election is made (a) there is substituted by implication of law for the primary obligations of the party in default which remain unperformed a secondary obligation to pay monetary compensation to the other party for the loss sustained by him in consequence of their non-performance in the future and (b) the unperformed primary obligations of the other party are discharged...”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;A breach of the type envisaged by Lord Diplock in his “exception (1)” above, being so serious as to deprive the innocent party of effectively the whole benefit of his bargain, might be given various labels. The accepted and uncontroversial term to use is “repudiatory breach”. For reasons which should be obvious, “fundamental breach” would not be a happy description even though it is factually accurate.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">It is tempting to take the test for repudiatory breach (loss of effectively the whole benefit of the bargain) and interpret it as fixing a threshold already established for common mistake and frustration. Where the true situation at the time of contracting, unbeknown to the parties, has that effect upon the bargain, common mistake renders the contract void. Where events produce that effect without either party&#8217;s fault, and the contract cannot be taken to govern the situation, the contract is frustrated. Where effective loss of the whole bargain is the one party&#8217;s responsibility, that is a repudiatory breach. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The sellers made no response to this message. An arbitrator later held that the sellers&#8217; silence and failure to take further steps to perform the contract had amounted to an acceptance of the buyers&#8217; repudiation. This decision was upheld by the House of Lords.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord <span class="bd">Steyn</span> “It is now possible to turn directly to the first issue posed, namely whether non-performance of an obligation is ever as a matter of law capable of constituting an act of acceptance. On this aspect I found the judgment of Phillips J [at first instance] entirely convincing. One cannot generalise on the point. It all depends on the particular contractual relationship and the particular circumstances of the case. But, like Phillips J, I am satisfied that a failure to perform may sometimes signify to a repudiating party an election by the aggrieved party to treat the contract as at an end. Postulate the case where an employer at the end of a day tells a contractor that he, the employer, is repudiating the contract and that the contractor need not return the next day. The contractor does not return the next day or at all. It seems to me that the contractor&#8217;s failure to return may, in the absence of any other explanation, convey a decision to treat the contract as at an end. Another example may be an overseas sale providing for shipment on a named ship in a given month. The seller is obliged to obtain an export licence. The buyer repudiates the contract before loading starts. To the knowledge of the buyer the seller does not apply for an export licence with the result that the transaction cannot proceed. In such circumstances it may be that an ordinary businessman, circumstanced as the parties were, would conclude that the seller was treating the contract as at an end”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

On 22 May the plaintiff brought an action claiming damages for breach of contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Queen&#8217;s Bench held that this claim could properly be initiated even before the date for performance of the contract had arrived.

But it is surely much more rational, and more for the benefit of both parties, that, after the renunciation of the agreement by the defendant, the plaintiff should be at liberty to consider himself absolved from any future performance of it, retaining his right to sue for any damage he has suffered from the breach of it. Thus, instead of remaining idle and laying out money in preparations which must be useless, he is at liberty to seek service under another employer, which would go in mitigation of the damages to which he would otherwise be entitled for a breach of the contract. It seems strange that the defendant, after renouncing the contract, and absolutely declaring that he will never act under it, should be permitted to object that faith is given to his assertion, and that an opportunity is not left to him of changing his mind”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The law is particularly clearly explained in the next case, which is authority for the innocent party&#8217;s freedom to accept or reject the other&#8217;s repudiation.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

It was not possible, on these facts, to regard the defendant as having had a choice whether or not to leave the buildings in their unfinished state.

It is only where the circumstances are such as to give that option that there is any evidence on which to ground the inference of a new contract. Where, as in the case of work done on land, the circumstances are such as to give the defendant no option whether he will take the benefit of the work or not, then one must look to other facts than the mere taking the benefit of the work in order to ground the inference of a new contract. In this case I see no other facts on which such an inference can be founded. The mere fact that a defendant is in possession of what he cannot help keeping, or even has done work upon it, affords no ground for such an inference. He is not bound to keep unfinished a building which in an incomplete state would be a nuisance on his land. I am therefore of opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for the work which he had done”.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The court commented that this outcome was not unjust; the plaintiff had been asked to remedy the defects, but had refused to do so.<br>&emsp;&emsp;There may be a failure of substantial performance even if the work performed by one party is not objectively of poor quality. The next case gives quite a striking example.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The oil was delivered within that period, although at 8.30pm on 31 March, a Saturday. The buyer refused to take delivery of it at that hour. A jury found that the conduct of the seller was unreasonable, but that had the buyer taken delivery, he would have had the opportunity to inspect the oil before the delivery period expired at midnight.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The court held that the buyer was wrong to refuse to take delivery, so that the seller could maintain an action for breach of contract.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Baron Rolfe&#8217;s statement of the law is rightly regarded by the editors of <i>Cheshire &amp; Fifoot</i> as a model of lucidity: “In every contract by which a party binds himself to deliver goods or pay money to another, he in fact engages to do an act which he cannot completely perform without the concurrence of the party to whom the delivery or the payment is to be made. Without acceptance on the part of him who is to receive, the act of him who is to deliver can amount only to a tender. But the law considers a party who has entered into a contract to deliver goods or pay money to another as having, substantially, performed it if he has tendered the goods or the money... provided only that the tender has been made under such circumstances that the party to whom it has been made has had a reasonable opportunity of examining the goods, or the money, tendered, in order to ascertain that the thing tendered really was what it purported to be. Indeed, without such an opportunity an offer to deliver or to pay does not amount to a tender. Now to apply this principle to the present case. The contract was to deliver the oil before the end of March. The plaintiffs did in pursuance of that contract tender the oil to the defendant at a time which, according to the express finding of the jury, left him full opportunity to examine, weigh and receive it before the end of March. If he had then accepted it ... the contract would have been literally performed; and the neglect of the defendant to perform his part of the contract ... cannot in my opinion in any manner affect the rights of the plaintiffs ...They fulfilled all they had contracted to do.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Only the last sentence of the passage quoted above requires qualification. The seller had not, of course, fulfilled all he had contracted to do because he still had the oil. Therefore, an action for the contract price could not be maintained, because it would amount to “double recovery”.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In fact, the maxim that “tender of performance is as good as performance” needs to be applied with care. Its effect here is not to put the seller in the position in which he would have been but for the buyer&#8217;s default. Rather, it provides a complete defence to an action by the buyer for non-delivery, and it enables the seller to bring a claim for damages. The measure of that claim would be the difference between the market value of the oil, and the price (if it was indeed higher) which would have been payable pursuant to the contract. The seller would be under no further obligation to attempt to deliver the oil, since the buyer&#8217;s default would amount to a repudiatory breach of contract.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In the case of an attempt to pay a debt, the “tender of performance” doctrine would work rather differently. The debtor, having tendered payment, clearly could not be sued for non-payment. However, the debtor would have no action for damages, and the debt would still be owed. The difference between the two situations consists in this; in the second, the debtor continues in possession of something belonging to the creditor, so that his obligation to restore it remains. In the case of a sale of goods, the same analysis cannot be applied.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">In the case of a contract of employment, the situation is again different. Here, the doctrine of “tender of performance” simply has no application. This is a matter of policy. The courts&#8217; distaste at the prospect of an employee pointlessly holding himself available for work when his services have (albeit wrongfully) been refused is apparent in Hochster v De la Tour above, and will be met with again below. Here, its effect is to disapply the doctrine of tender of performance. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The respondents&#8217; garage had been advertised in this way for three years. The respondent&#8217;s sales manager then made a new contract with the appellants for a further three years of advertising. He had apparent authority to do so (and the contract was therefore valid) but no actual authority. His employer immediately wrote to the appellants to cancel the contract – an anticipatory repudiation. The appellants declined to accept this repudiation, and began to advertise the garage business on the bins. When the respondent failed to pay any instalments as they fell due, the appellant took advantage of a clause in the contract entitling them to bring an action immediately for the entirety of the agreed price.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The House of Lords held, by a bare majority, that basic contractual principle gave the appellants the right which they were asserting. The respondent&#8217;s repudiation of the contract allowed the other party to elect whether to accept that breach and sue for damages or, as they had opted to do, refuse to accept it and continue to perform. It could not be objected that the appellants had failed to mitigate, because the doctrine of mitigation applied only to claims for damages. This was an action for an agreed sum.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Reid, in the majority, recognised that in some circumstances the right claimed here by the appellants might be defeated on the grounds of policy, or by equitable considerations:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“The other ground [in preference to a case which his lordship considered wrongly decided] would be that there is some general equitable principle or element of public policy which requires this limitation of the contractual rights of the innocent party. It may well be that, if it can be shown that a person has no legitimate interest, financial or otherwise, in performing the contract rather than claiming damages, he ought not to be allowed to saddle the other party with an additional burden with no benefit to himself. If a party has no interest to enforce a stipulation, he cannot in general enforce it: so it might be said that, if a party has no interest to insist on a particular remedy, he ought not to be allowed to insist on it. And, just as a party is not allowed to enforce a penalty, so he ought not to be allowed to penalise the other party by taking one course when another is equally advantageous to him. If I may revert to the example which I gave of a company engaging an expert to prepare an elaborate report and then repudiating before anything was done, it might be that the company could show that the expert had no substantial or legitimate interest in carrying out the work rather than accepting damages: I would think that the <i>de minimis</i> principle would apply in determining whether his interest was substantial, and that he might have a legitimate interest other than an immediate financial interest. But if the expert had no such interest then that might be regarded as a proper case for the exercise of the general equitable jurisdiction of the court. But that is not this case. Here the respondent did not set out to prove that the appellants had no legitimate interest in completing the contract and claiming the contract price rather than claiming damages; there is nothing in the findings of fact to support such a case, and it seems improbable that any such case could have been proved. It is, in my judgment, impossible to say that the appellants should be deprived of their right to claim the contract price merely because the benefit to them, as against claiming damages and reletting their advertising space, might be small in comparison with the loss to the respondent: that is the most that can be said in favour of the respondent”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;White &amp; Carter</i> is a curious case, showing that extrapolation from basic contractual principles will not invariably yield attractive results. Yet the extrapolation is irresistible; repudiatory breach of contract (specifically, breach of condition) does give the innocent party a choice, and in the making of that choice there is no rule that the interests of the contract breaker must be protected.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It has been remarked that this situation will not arise where performance requires the other party&#8217;s co-operation. The co-operation will not be forthcoming, so performance will not take place and the innocent party will be restricted to damages for breach by way of remedy. However, that is merely a practical limitation on the applicability of the rule in <i>White &amp; Carter</i>, not a principled one.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A principled limitation on the rule was advocated by Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span>, among others, who was stridently critical of <i>White &amp; Carter</i>. He said (in <i>The Puerto Buitrago</i> (1976)) that he would follow it only because it was House of Lords authority, but added that in his view the rule could not be reconciled with principle governing the availability of specific performance. Specific performance issues only at the discretion of the court, and will not be granted where damages would be an adequate remedy. To invoke the rule in <i>White v Carter</i> is to extort the equivalent of specific performance which, if it had depended on the court, would have been refused.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In employment cases, Lord Denning&#8217;s doubts have hardened into legal fact. An employee, dismissed in breach of contract, cannot rely on <i>White &amp; Carter</i> in any circumstances, any more than he would be able to obtain specific performance (or invoke the doctrine of tender of performance).</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The contract of sale relevantly stipulated that if, after sale, Mr Makdessi were to be in breach of restrictive covenants designed to prevent him from competing against the business (a) he would not be paid the final two instalments of the sale price (clause 5.1); and (b) he could be required to sell his remaining shares in the business at a price which excluded the value of its goodwill (clause 5.6). He breached the covenants, but argued that the two clauses were unenforceable against him since they were penalties. The Court of Appeal upheld his case.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The second appeal arose from the imposition of a £85 charge upon Mr Beavis for leaving his car for about one hour longer than the two hour limit in a car park managed by ParkingEye Ltd on behalf of a retail park in Chelmsford. He argued that the charge was invalid at common law as a penalty, and breached the provisions of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, then in force, since it was unfair. The Court of Appeal rejected both his arguments.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Supreme Court found against Makdessi and, (by a majority of 6:1, Lord Toulson dissenting) against Beavis. In Makdessi&#8217;s case, the two clauses in question were primary obligations of the contract of sale, serving to fix the price (see the distinction between primary and secondary or remedial obligations as explained by L. <span class="bd">Diplock</span> in <i>PhotoProductions v Securicor</i> <i>(1980</i>)). Primary contractual obligations cannot be impugned as penalties. In Beavis, the charge notice was secondary, but was not penal in view of the amount payable and the fact that ParkingEye had a legitimate interest in levying it on overstayers. Lord Toulson, dissenting, was of opinion that that charging notice fell foul of the 1999 Regulations.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The problem with the penalty rule is that on the one hand it is an infringement upon freedom of contract, whilst on the other hand it has been deemed contrary to public policy to permit parties albeit by agreement to set up private punitive regimes.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lords Neuberger and Sumption begin their joint speech by observing that the penalty rule is “an ancient, haphazardly constructed edifice which has not weathered well...”. They trace its emergence from the inclination of equity to consider relief against forfeiture and against the inordinate penalties inherent within the device (encountered in <i>Pinnel&#8217;s Case</i>) of the penal bond with conditional defeasance. The common law appears to have taken over the latter concern, staying the action on a penalty provided that the original debt were paid with interest and costs.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The four tests proposed by Lord Dunedin in the <i>Dunlop</i> case for identifying penalties were observed to have “achieved the status of a quasi-statutory code in the subsequent case-law”. This was not said by way of approval, but rather to introduce the need to consider the rationale of the penalty rule at a more fundamental level. The appropriate level was found in the speech of Lord <span class="bd">Atkin</span>son: what was the nature and extent of the innocent party&#8217;s interest in the performance of the relevant primary obligation? Lords Neuberger and Sumption formulated the following test: “... whether the impugned provision is a secondary obligation which imposes a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the primary obligation”.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Their Lordships had been invited by the respective parties either to abrogate or to extend the rule, but declined to do so. Against abrogation, some equivalent to the rule was to be found in almost all major western systems of law. Against extension to circumstances not involving a strict breach of contract, the rule was already an inroad upon freedom of contracting, and not therefore to be broadened by judicial decision-making.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The defendant, a carrier, was engaged by him to take the mill&#8217;s crank-shaft to Greenwich as a pattern for a new shaft, and to re-deliver it. The defendant promised that delivery at Greenwich would take place the next day, but delayed so that a further five days passed. During this time the mill was at a standstill, because there was no spare crank-shaft. The plaintiff sued the defendant for damages for breach of contract, including damages for loss of profits which the mill would have earned if active.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Exchequer held that the lost profits were not recoverable from the carrier. The loss arose from the unusual circumstance that the mill had only the one crank-shaft. Therefore, although the loss was a consequence of the defendant&#8217;s breach, it could not be regarded as arising in the ordinary course of things; most mills would have had a spare. Nor had the unusual circumstance been known to the defendant. If it had been, then that would have fixed him with liability for it.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Alderson B explained these two rationales for recovery in the following passage, thought by Professor Burrows to be the most cited in English contract law:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Now we think the proper rule in such a case as the present is this:- Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, ie. according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="bd">McKendrick</span> helpfully elucidates three points of importance to an understanding of <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i>. The first is that the rule focuses attention on the parties&#8217; state of mind at the time of entry into the contract. That is because the court, at least in principle, is concerned to gauge the contractual allocation of risk (out of deference to the parties&#8217; intention and to the principle of freedom of contract). Liability for unusual loss cannot be sprung on a defendant who had no opportunity to bargain for protection against it or for compensation for running the risk of it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The second point relates simply to how much the carrier knew. The third point is that <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> crucially leaves it unclear whether contemplation of special circumstances is sufficient to fix the defendant with liability for the loss arising from them, or whether something more akin to an agreement to accept liability is required. This question is the subject of the important and recent House of Lords case “<i>The Achilleas</i>”.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The traditional understanding of the rule in Hadley v Baxendale, and more particularly its second limb, is that if the defendant gains knowledge of a risk of unusual loss that will render him liable if the loss occurs through his breach of contract. Professor Richard Danzig has made the interesting point that the relationship between this principle and the facts underlying Hadley v Baxendale is somewhat ironic.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Most short accounts of the case describe the defendant, Baxendale, as a common carrier, and so he was. More to the point, however, Joseph Baxendale was a senior partner in the firm of Pickfords. In his article “Hadley v Baxendale: a Study in the Industrialization of the Law”, Danzig explains that the size and complexity of Pickfords&#8217; operations were such as to cause astonishment even before the date of this case (Joseph Baxendale himself had played a major role in building the firm up). Pickfords&#8217; internal organisation was so sophisticated that it required study before it could be grasped by the firm&#8217;s employees. Danzig&#8217;s observation is that the judgment in the case lags behind the fact; in the context of a modern mass-transaction business it was simply unrealistic to formulate a rule fitted to custom-made dealing. In Danzig&#8217;s view, it is specifically the protectionism of Alderson B&#8217;s approach which is irrelevant to mass-transactional business. Abnormal loss, for such a firm, will be averaged out across thousands of contracts and, in any event, covered by insurance.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The next case narrows the distinction between the two limbs of the rule in <i>Hadley v Baxendale,</i> treating the two types of loss as existing upon a continuum of foreseeability. Its greater significance lies in the terminology used by Asquith LJ to discuss remoteness of loss. This was later taken by the House of Lords to have strayed from the contractual into the tortious approach to consequential loss.</span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

They ordered a new and larger boiler from the defendants, who were aware that the plaintiffs&#8217; intention was to put the boiler to use as soon as possible. For delivery, the boiler had to be dismantled, and in the course of that it was badly damaged. It was finally delivered five months late. The plaintiffs claimed (a) loss of profits which they said they would have earned through developing their business during this period; and (b) loss of profits on certain highly lucrative dyeing contracts with the Ministry of Supply which they would have taken on with the new boiler. At first instance no damages were awarded in respect of lost profits.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal approached the matter on the footing that loss had to be reasonably foreseeable to the defendant at the time of contracting. The claim for general profits was therefore allowed. It would have been obvious to a reasonable person in the defendants&#8217; position that a business prepared to pay some £2000 for new plant, and wishing to obtain it as quickly as possible at a time of scarce laundry facilities, was expecting to operate it for profit. The claim for profits under the special Ministry contracts was held rightly to have been refused, since the boiler manufacturers had no knowledge of the prospects and terms of such contracts.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;In giving judgment, Asquith LJ stated as a general principle that “[i]n cases of breach of contract the aggrieved party is only entitled to recover such part of the loss actually resulting as was at the time of the contract reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach”. The question of foreseeability depended upon the defendant&#8217;s knowledge, which consisted in what he actually knew, and what he would be deemed to have known as a reasonable person.

In breach of contract the defendants caused the ship to deviate during the voyage, arriving nine days late at Basrah. The market price of sugar at Basrah fell during the nine days, and the plaintiff claimed the price fall in damages. At first instance, the judge found that the defendant had not known of the plaintiff&#8217;s intention to sell the sugar in the market on arrival at Basrah, but had known that there was a sugar market at Basrah. The loss caused by the fall in market price was regarded as too remote. The Court of Appeal reversed this decision.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;The significance of this case lies chiefly in its explanation of the different horizons of recovery of loss in contract and tort respectively. The judgment of Asquith LJ is criticised for its use of phraseology which could be misunderstood as importing the tortious test for remoteness into contract, and for vagueness in describing the level of foreseeability proper to contract. The words “reasonably foreseeable” are too redolent of the horizon of recovery in tort established by the leading case of <i>Wagon Mound (No 2)</i> (1976). There, they include results which are far from likely, but which on ordinary tortious principles must nevertheless be deemed foreseeable.<br>&emsp;&emsp;It has rightly been said that their Lordships&#8217; speeches in <i>The Heron II</i> are unedifying in their repeated and none too persuasive attempts to compare and select phrases best suited to summing up the greater likelihood of loss required in contract than in tort. Professor Burrows suggests that the nub of the distinction sought to be drawn in the case amounts to no more than this: a slight possibility of loss is sufficient for tortious liability, whereas contract law requires the risk to be a serious one. There are several indications in the case that the defendant&#8217;s “contemplation” of a serious risk is required rather than mere “foresight”, but it is questionable whether that distinction amounts to much.<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the face of the House of Lords&#8217; insistence that contract and tort losses are to be treated differently, the next case is a rather surprising foray in the opposite direction.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

The hopper&#8217;s ventilated top was sealed shut for the purposes of transport, and the defendants failed to unseal it. The nuts stored in the hopper went mouldy, but the plaintiffs continued to feed them to the pigs in the belief that no harm would come of this. In fact a large number of the pigs contracted E coli from eating the mouldy nuts, and died. The plaintiffs sued for the value of the pigs. The defendant argued that this was too remote a consequence of the breach of contract.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The Court of Appeal, affirming the judgment at first instance, unanimously held that the loss was recoverable. However, Lord <span class="bd">Denning MR</span> on the one hand, and on the other hand Scarman and Orr LLJ differed in their reasoning about remoteness of loss in contract and tort. Lord <span class="bd">Denning MR</span> proposed that the “contemplation of a serious possibility” test from <i>The Heron II</i> was appropriate in the case of loss of profits, whereas the tortious test of reasonable foreseeability should be used in cases of physical damage whether brought in contract or tort. Scarman and Orr LLJ denied that this resolution of the problem was supported by the caselaw, and instead attempted to argue that the type of loss in question must have been a serious possibility, even if the manner of its occurrence was markedly less foreseeable.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Discussion</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Neither the approach of Lord Denning MR nor that of the other two judges is easily reconciled with <i>The Heron II</i>. Furthermore, it has been doubted whether the majority&#8217;s analysis can stand with the <i>Victoria Laundry</i> case. If the (unlikely) death of the pigs is brought within the horizon of recovery because the likelihood of mild illness from consuming mouldy feed was a serious possibility, then on a similar analysis the contemplation of loss of some profits in the earlier case should have qualified the loss of exceptional profits as recoverable. It was loss of the same kind.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Perhaps the more general problem brought to light by <i>Parsons v Uttley Ingham</i>, however, is that the test may produce varying results according to the degree of specificity with which the risk is stated. This, of course, is why the <i>Victoria Laundry</i> case was able to distinguish between two types of profit. Similarly it is one thing to ask whether it is likely that the storage of food in a container unfit for the purpose could endanger the livestock which was to eat it. To enquire as to the likelihood of an unventilated hopper causing an outbreak of E Coli may produce a different answer. The greater the specificity with which the question is posed, the more likely it is that answer will insulate the defendant from liability.</p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>

A follow-on charter of the vessel to a third party had been agreed, with a latest delivery date of 8 May. When it became apparent as a result of the charterers&#8217; delay that the ship would not be available by 8 May, the shipowners renegotiated the follow-on charter, and were obliged to agree to a reduction in hire to a significantly lower rate (the market rate having fallen sharply). Redelivery took place on 11 May. The charterers admitted liability for the difference between the originally agreed rate and the new market rate between 2 and 11 May, but the shipowners claimed the difference between the two rates for the entire duration of the follow-on fixture, which was four years. The charterers argued that this loss was too remote.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Arbitrators, by a majority, found that the full loss followed naturally from the breach and therefore fell within the first limb of <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i>. The House of Lords held unanimously that it was too remote, but for differing reasons.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">Detail </span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord <span class="bd">Hoffman</span>n and Lord Hope approached the matter by enquiring whether the charterers could be said to have <i>assumed responsibility</i> for all loss arising from the delayed start to the follow-on fixture. This was to be decided by interpretation of the contract in its commercial context; and the apparent understanding of industry experts was that loss would be limited to the overrun period. The rules in <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> and <i>The Heron II</i> were designed to give effect to the intention of the parties, and to that end should be interpreted flexibly if necessary.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Rodger and Baroness Hale adopted an analysis akin to that of the <i>Victoria Laundry</i> case, distinguishing between the type of loss which had foreseeably arisen from the delay, and the further loss which was not within the charterers&#8217; contemplation.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Lord Walker considered that the purpose of the <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> rules was to identify the common basis on which the parties were contracting, and denied that the charterers were undertaking liability for any loss whatsoever arising from a situation beyond their knowledge or control. The application of the <i>Hadley v Baxendale</i> rules was general, but could be expected to vary between specialised areas of contracting. Lord Walker approved the analyses of Lords Hoffmann, Hope and Rodger.</p><p><span class="ud"><span class="bd">A closer look</span></span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">There are two levels of difficulty in this case. One is to assess what its ratio is, since there is a fairly clear contrast between addressing the problem as one of contextual interpretation of the contract, and applying a default legal rule. Lord Walker&#8217;s speech does not align him definitively with either of these camps.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The second level of difficulty lies in determining what the better resolution of such a case would be. Lord Hoffmann&#8217;s approach has the rather impressive characteristic of being entirely in keeping with his attitude to implied terms and to contractual interpretation generally – see lecture 10. When he points out that the quantification of compensation for loss must be preceded by a principled decision as to the kind of loss which is to be compensated, this has the ring of a good contractual analysis However, it has been criticised because of the risk that it will often lead to uncertainty. On the facts of The Achilleas, there was an industry consensus limiting the charterers&#8217; liability, but that will not be so in every case.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Furthermore, it may be doubted as a matter of principle whether the rules on consequential loss can invariably be derived from the parties&#8217; agreement. This would seem to depend on whether they are seen as establishing how much loss can be recovered from the defendant, or whether they exist to protect the defendant from inordinate loss as a matter of policy. Sometimes they may be applied to the first of these ends, and sometimes to the second. To choose in the absence of facts may well be mistaken. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it"> In the case of frustration of common purpose it was once thought possible to have the contract govern even in circumstances which the parties had not remotely envisaged (the implied term theory of frustration). Davis Contractors v Fareham gave the quietus to that notion, replacing it by the candid recognition that frustration was a matter of legal policy rather than the parties&#8217; fictitious intentions – see lecture 16. Remoteness of loss is arguably similar, though the rules can be displaced by express agreement between the parties just as frustration can be displaced by contractual provisions. Perhaps the most appropriate attitude is one akin to Lord <span class="bd">Denning</span>&#8216;s in The Eugenia; by all means see if the contract has allocated the risk in question, but stop short of insisting that the oracle has spoken if in fact it has not. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Cases still more recent than <i>The Achilleas</i> concur in attributing little precedental force to Lord Hoffmann&#8217;s suggested “assumption of responsibility” test, and emphasise the continued relevance of the long-standing rules on remoteness of loss.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The bulk of this lecture has concerned damages, since this is the standard remedy for breach of contract in English law.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Specific performance, a separate remedy, consists in the court ordering the defendant to carry out a contractual obligation.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Beyond the obviously different objectives of damages and specific performance, the two remedies can be contrasted in various other ways. Damages (even if only nominal) are available as of right where a breach can be proven and there is no defence to it. Specific performance issues only at the discretion of the court. The award of damages is a common law remedy; specific performance is an exercise of the court&#8217;s equitable jurisdiction. What is more, the relationship between the two remedies is essentially antithetical since specific performance has traditionally been withheld where damages would be an adequate remedy.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Further limitations on the availability of specific performance derive from its equitable origins, and from considerations of practicality and policy. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Examples of the first type include the withholding of specific performance where the remedy would cause disproportionate hardship to the defendant; where the remedy would not be granted to enforce the claimant&#8217;s own performance; and where the claimant has not acted equitably. In this last respect the handling of specific performance requires a type of awareness normally associated with legal ethics.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">Examples of the second type (there is perhaps some overlap) include the principle that specific performance will not normally be ordered if its effect would be to bind the defendant to perform personal services in the context of a failed relationship; or where the court would effectively have to supervise compliance over a lengthy period. A complex regime of supervision is all the more unattractive in view of the fact that default would amount to contempt of court and could therefore result in the imposition of disproportionate sanctions.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The classic setting for specific performance is contracts for the sale of land. Land has traditionally been regarded by the courts as unique, so that it follows that an award of damages would not enable a claimant to acquire <i>equivalent land</i>. This reasoning has been extended to other property which can be shown on the evidence to be unique or particularly difficult to obtain.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">All restitutionary claims are based on the assertion that the defendant has acquired some benefit which ought in fairness to be returned to the claimant. They seek to prevent the defendant&#8217;s unjust enrichment. </span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The major question within restitution concerns the availability of the remedy where the defendant has been enriched, but not at the expense of the claimant.</span><br>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="it">The terminology in common use contrasts “enrichment by subtraction” with “enrichment without subtraction”. </span></p></div><div class='details details-held'></div></div> </div>
