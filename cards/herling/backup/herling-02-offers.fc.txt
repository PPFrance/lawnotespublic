SUMMARY ~*Introduction*~
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Perhaps the most fundamental statement which could be made of the law of contract is this; a contract is an agreement, and the courts normally require agreement to arise from the making of an offer by one party and its acceptance by the other. By this means the parties to a contract can be shown to be “ad idem”, or “of the same mind”. In other words, they are in agreement.
/->-To identify the circumstances in which agreement is present, one begins by looking for an offer. 
/->-This lecture addresses the means by which the courts identify an offer as such. The topic is a fundamental one, because once an offer has been made, both parties will be bound by its terms if the offeree accepts it.

SUMMARY ~*Objective view of Intention and Agreement*~
/->-What is an offer? Before this question can be addressed, there is a preliminary issue which must be explored. What perspective is adopted by the courts when they analyse the parties' dealings in order to identify offer and acceptance? Is the status of the parties' communications with each other analysed objectively, by reference to their ostensible meaning, or is it deduced from the parties' subjective intentions? The applicable rule is the first of those two approaches. The parties' “intentions” are objectively gauged.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_If that is so, and it is actually the <b>appearance</b> rather than the <b>fact</b> of agreement which is required, then the notion of being “of the same mind” is mildly problematic. The parties may be deemed to be in agreement even though actually they are not. _
/->-_The following proposition goes some way towards resolving this tension. Being “ad idem” is a broad ideal in contract analysis; for example, it is perfectly proper to point out that the parties are not “ad idem” when there is open disagreement between them. However, ostensible agreement may prevail over actual but latent misunderstanding. The ideal of true agreement cannot generally be used to invalidate an ostensible agreement. The reason is that each party must be entitled to rely on what reasonably appears to be other's intentions. Private, unexpressed intentions or reservations cannot undermine reasonable grounds for reliance. If it were otherwise, contract law would fail in its duty to promote certainty and predictability within the commercial sphere. _




NAME Smith v Hughes
CITATION Smith v Hughes (1871) LR 6 QB 597
CATEGORY Offers; Objective view of Intention and Agreement
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The defendant, a trainer of racehorses, agreed to buy a quantity of oats, thinking them to be “old” oats. He had seen a sample of the oats. In fact they were new, not old. For that reason he refused to pay for them, and was sued by the plaintiff. At trial, the judge directed the jury to give a verdict in the defendant's favour if they found that the oats had been described as “old”, or alternatively if they found if the plaintiff seller had been aware that the defendant believed he was contracting to buy old oats. They found for the defendant, but were not asked to state on which basis. The Court of Appeal ordered a re-trial on the ground that the trial judge's direction had been unclear.
/->-The value of the case lies in the judges' discussion of the direction given to the jury at trial, and the fine distinction that in their view it failed to convey.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-The first part of the direction to the jury was unexceptionable. If, as the defendant contended, the plaintiff seller had referred to the oats as “old”, then that would have been materially misleading. The second part of the direction had been unclear (although technically acceptable) because it failed to make an adequate distinction between two possible situations. If the plaintiff had merely been aware that the defendant was buying the oats believing them to be old, and had taken no steps to disabuse him of that belief, then the contract was valid. However, if the plaintiff had known that the defendant thought he had the benefit of a contractual promise that the oats were old, then there would have been no true agreement between the parties, and therefore no contract. The jury could not reliably be assumed to have grasped that fine distinction.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-The decision in <i>Smith v Hughes</i> turns upon quite a narrow point of construction, but the judgments lay down broad propositions about the way in which contracting parties' states of mind impact upon the validity of their dealings. One party may be mistaken about the subject matter of the contract, even to the extent that he would not have entered into the contract had he known the truth, but the contract remains valid. The principle is stated by Blackburn J to be this: “If, whatever a man's real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party's terms”. Furthermore, the one party may be aware that the other is making a mistake, but be under no obligation to correct him; still the contract is valid. 
/->-It is quite different if one has taken active steps to promote or sustain the mistaken belief; the objective appearance of agreement yields to the subjective knowledge of the true state of affairs. The reason is that deception is now present; naturally no court will collude with it. 
/->-It seems that the same result follows where the mistake relates to the terms of the contract and the other knows of the mistake, <i>even though he has done nothing to induce it.</i> Cases of this sort, all involving mistakes as to price, are given below. First, though, be aware of another case in which the doctrine of <i>Smith v Hughes</i> cuts through the confusion. 




NAME Rose v Pim
CITATION Rose v Pim [1953] 2QB 450
CATEGORY Offers; Objective view of Intention and Agreement
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-This is another case in which objective appearance prevailed over a subjective concern. The plaintiffs were asked by their Egyptian house to acquire “Moroccan horsebeans described here as feveroles”. They asked the defendants' representative what “feveroles” were, and were told that they were simply horsebeans. A chain of related supply contracts was then agreed in which the commodity to be supplied was described as “horsebeans”. The eventual buyer found that they were not “feveroles”, and sought damages. The plaintiffs in the present action were applying for rectification of their contract with the defendants on the basis that it mistakenly referred to “horsebeans” and should have specified “feveroles”. They failed. The agreement was simply one for the supply of horsebeans.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-The judgment of *Denning LJ* includes emphatic support for the objective approach to the construction of contracts: “The parties no doubt intended that the goods should satisfy the inquiry of the Egyptian buyers, namely, “horsebeans described in Egypt as feveroles”. They assumed that they would do so, but they made no contract to that effect. Their agreement, as outwardly expressed, both orally and in writing, was for “horsebeans”. That is all the defendants ever committed themselves to supply; and all that they should be bound to”.

NAME Hartog v Colin & Shields
CITATION Hartog v Colin & Shields [1939] All ER 566
CATEGORY Offers; Objective view of Intention and Agreement
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The sellers offered Argentine hare skins at a given price per pound. This was a mistake; they had in mind the price per piece, and had therefore quoted at roughly one third of the going rate. The buyer ordered 30,000 hare skins, and sued the sellers when they refused to deliver. The court held that the buyer must have been aware of the sellers' mistake, and therefore must have been aware that the sellers' offer did not represent their true intention. Thus there was no agreement between the parties upon which an action could be maintained.
/->-The case is significant because it seems to propose that the subjective knowledge of an error defeats the objective appearance of agreement.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-There was strong evidence in this case that the price of Argentine hare skins was normally quoted per piece, so the court had no difficulty concluding that the buyer must have been aware of the mistake. 
/->-Behaviour like that of the buyer here is often described as the “snapping up” of an offer. It occurs where one party purports to accept an offer which he knows it was not the other's true intention to make. Here, it seems to work to say that the parties were not “ad idem”. However some care is needed in order to reconcile this principle with some of what was said in <i>Smith v Hughes</i>. There, it would have been acceptable for the seller of new oats to enforce a bargain with a buyer who obviously thought the oats were old. Is that known mistake really different from the known mistake in <i>Hartog</i>? It seems that it is. The allowable mistake in <i>Smith v Hughes</i> can be regarded as one of mere motive; the buyer is making a wrong, unintended, unwise deal, maybe even to the certain knowledge of the seller, but he is under no mistake as to the terms of the deal itself. The invalidating mistake in <i>Hartog</i> concerns one of the most fundamental terms of the deal – the price.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_Nevertheless, it is easy to lose sight of this distinction. The reason is that the court's express analysis in Hartog focuses quite strongly on the state of mind of the would-be buyer of hare skins; he must have known that the other was making a mistake. It is tempting to conclude that it is the presence of this knowledge (with its connotations of impropriety) that drives the decision. In a more recent case, Chwee Kin Kong v Digilandmall.com Pte [2004] SGHC 71, there is express emphasis on the state of mind of the would-be snappers up. When a price for laser printers was mistakenly given as 66 rather than 3,854 Singaporean dollars, buyers were said to have moved “at the dead of night” and with “indecent haste” to place huge orders before the mistake could be corrected. Unsurprisingly, they were not successful in their attempt to sue for loss of profits when the printers were not delivered. But on a proper analysis, the reason they fail is <b>not</b> that they attempt to take unconscionable advantage of the mistaken seller. Nor is it that the seller's mistake is clear. They fail because the mistake relates to a term of the contract so that the parties are never in agreement. If the mistake had been equally serious and equally obvious, but related only to something beyond the terms of the contract, the result ought in theory to be different._
/->-_Why does this distinction seem to get overlooked? The answer is that it is always going to be easier to talk about one party's bad behaviour than about the fine and abstract difference between two types of mistake. This is often so in law; the surface discourse may not wholly connect with the real principles in play._
/->-_Further permutations of mistake affecting the formation of the contract will be examined later (during term 2) when the various types of contractual mistake are in issue. The cases on “mutual mistake”, where the parties are at cross-purposes, and “common mistake”, where they share a single delusion, take the discussion forward. However, you may already be wondering why so much should seem to turn on the distinction between a mistake about the content of a contract, and a mistake about its context. *Treitel* comments that “this distinction seems to be generally accepted, but the reason for it is not easy to see” (para 8-044)._
/->-_There is another well-known case on the attempted snapping-up of an offer – <i>Centrovincial Estates plc v Merchant Investors Assurance Company Ltd. </i> A lot of prominence is given to it by *McKendrick*, even though it does not go far beyond the two cases set out above. However, a procedural aspect of the case makes it rather hard to understand. For some help with the difficulty, read on._

NAME Centrovincial Estates v Merchant Investors Assurance Company Ltd
CITATION Centrovincial Estates v Merchant Investors Assurance Company Ltd [1983] Com LR 158
CATEGORY Offers; Objective view of Intention and Agreement
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-During negotiations over an existing lease, the landlords' solicitors wrote to the lessees proposing that the “current market rental value” of the property should be contractually agreed to be £65,000. After the lessees had agreed, the landlords stated that they had made a mistake, and had meant to propose the sum of £126,000. The lessees objected that £65,000 was the contractually agreed figure. The landlords brought an action against them, seeking a declaration that there was no agreement. As part of this action, they sought summary judgment. The Court of Appeal held that summary judgment could not be obtained on these facts. Therefore, at this interlocutory stage, the lessees won.
SUMMARY ~*Explanation*~
/->-Since the first figure proposed by the landlords was so much lower than the figure they had meant to propose, this looks like a typical snapping-up case. It is therefore difficult at first glance to understand why it goes against the landlords. The key to it is this. An application for summary judgment (ie. a quick victory) can be made where it is possible to show at a preliminary hearing that the other side can have no arguable defence to one's claim, and therefore should not be allowed to proceed to a full trial. Here, the landlords conceded that the case would need to proceed to full trial for it to be established on the evidence whether the lessees did or did not know that a mistake was being made. That concession was fatal to their application for summary judgment. Therefore the lessees successfully defended this claim even though it may have been likely that they would lose when the matter was more closely investigated at trial. 
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_Is there in fact any difference between the perspectives of Smith v Hughes and Rose v Pim on the one hand, and Hartog v Colin & Shields and Centrovincial Estates plc v Merchant Investors on the other? At a first glance, one would think so. The first two cases seem to support an objective analysis, to which appearance rather than subjective intention matters. The second two cases seem to establish a limit to that perspective; there can be no reliance on objective appearance when it is subjectively known to be false._
/->-_On closer consideration, however, the two perspectives can be shown to be one and the same. It is the second – the subjective long-stop – which needs to be examined more closely. Technically, the factor which disentitles the would-be buyers in Hartog and Digilandmall from accepting what they are mistakenly offered may not be their realisation of the mistake. Instead it may be that a reasonable person in their position would realise that a mistake had been made. The long-stop is not subjective; it is actually an extension of the basic rule itself. The status of the parties' communications is determined objectively, and that perspective may reveal an offer in law even though there was no subjective intention to make one, or negate the existence of an offer which was subjectively but mistakenly intended. Appearance governs._




NAME Offer Distinguished From Invitation to Treat
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Offers; Offer Distinguished From Invitation to Treat
SUMMARY ~*Offer Distinguished From Invitation to Treat*~
/->-What is the nature of an offer? To put it in preliminary and informal terms, we are looking for a proposal which indicates the maker's willingness to be legally bound by acceptance, and one which is sufficiently clear and complete to be capable of acceptance.
/->-An offer may be made in elaborately formal terms, or (at the opposite extreme) it may be brief, basic, and made without any preliminaries. However, very often the parties will move towards agreement, discussing the possibility of doing business together before any offer is made. These preliminary discussions are known as “invitations to treat”, and may well take the form of enquiries, obviously evincing no intention to be bound. Although it is essential to be able to distinguish between invitations to treat and offers, it is not always straightforward. A considerable body of case-law exists to chart the distinction.
/->-Before we examine the cases on the distinction, there is an important preliminary point to be made. “Offer”, as a common English word, carries with it certain connotations. Be careful about carrying all those connotations over into the sphere of contractual analysis. For example, in the context of a sale of goods, one might naturally think that it is the seller of the goods who is offering them for sale. Legally speaking, the seller <i>may </i>be the offeror, but not necessarily so. A legal analysis may conclude that the buyer is the offeror. It is best to approach the cases with an open mind on this point; the offeror may be the active, initiating party within the negotiation, or not. Similarly, do not be dictated to by the parties' own use of the word “offer” (or “acceptance”). Legal analysis will take account of the parties' view of what they are doing, but will not be fettered by it. The applicable analysis is objective, nor subjective.




NAME Partridge v Crittenden
CITATION Partridge v Crittenden [1968] 1 WLR 1204
CATEGORY Offers; (A) Generally
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The defendant had placed an advertisement in the periodical “Cage and Aviary Birds”, reading “Bramblefinch cocks, Bramblefinch hens 25 s each”. He was prosecuted by the RSPCA under the Protection of Birds Act 1954 which made it an offence unlawfully to offer for sale a wild live bird. The magistrates convicted him of the offence. The High Court quashed the conviction. The advertisement was merely an invitation to treat, not an offer to sell.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-The High Court's reasoning is that the Act's reference to “offering for sale” must be understood within the context of contract law, and there is settled case-law to show that an advertisement of goods for sale does not normally amount to an offer in the legal sense. To this, one might object that Parliament's intention in passing the relevant section of the Act was almost certainly to punish people who tried to sell wild birds. The defendant in this case was just such a person, but because in the eye of contract law it is the would-be purchaser here who makes an offer to buy, the seller goes unpunished. 




NAME Fisher v Bell
CITATION Fisher v Bell [1961] 1 QB 394
CATEGORY Offers; (A) Generally
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-This was a similar case, heard a few years before <i>Partridge v Crittenden</i>. A shopkeeper displayed a flick knife in the window of his shop with a ticket behind it which read “Ejector knife- 4s”. He was charged under section 1 (1) of the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959, which made it an offence to offer such a knife for sale. It was held that he had not offered the knife for sale. The knife and the label merely constituted an invitation to treat.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-If <i>Partridge v Crittenden</i> was a difficult case to swallow, <i>Fisher v Bell</i> beggars belief. What was section 1 (1) of the Act passed by Parliament for, if not to suppress the selling of offensive weapons? By whatever reasoning could judges so thoroughly stultify its intention?
/->-An explanation is given in the judgment of Lord Parker CJ: “…any statute must of course be looked at in the light of the general law of the country. Parliament in its wisdom in passing an Act must be taken to know the general law. It is perfectly clear that according to the ordinary law of contract the display of an article with a price on it in a shop window is merely an invitation to treat. It is in no sense an offer for sale the acceptance of which concludes a contract….
/->-In those circumstances I am driven to the conclusion, though I confess reluctantly, that no offence was here committed. At first sight it sounds absurd that knives of this sort cannot be manufactured, sold, hired, lent or given, but apparently they can be displayed in shop windows; but even if this – and I am by no means saying it is – is a casus omissus, it is not for this court to supply the omission. I am mindful of the strong words of Lord Simonds in <i>Magor and St Mellons Rural District Council v Newport Corporation</i>…. In that case one of the Lords Justices in the Court of Appeal…had, in effect, said that the court having discovered the supposed intention of Parliament must proceed to fill in the gaps – what the Legislature has not written the court must write – and in answer to that contention Lord Simonds in his speech [in the House of Lords] said… “It appears to me to be a naked usurpation of the legislative function under the thin guise of interpretation”.
/->-The need to preserve certainty in the law of contract goes some way to explaining these surprising decisions, but why did the law tend to regard advertisements as mere invitations to treat rather than offers in the first place?




NAME Grainger & Sons v Gough (Surveyor of Taxes)
CITATION Grainger & Sons v Gough (Surveyor of Taxes) [1896] AC 85
CATEGORY Offers; (A) Generally
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-For the purposes of deciding an issue of liability to tax, it was necessary to determine whether a trade was being carried on in the United Kingdom or not. This required the House of Lords to decide whether an offer was made when a price list of wines was sent out by a wine merchant. It was held that the list was merely an invitation to treat, not an offer.
/->-Lord Herschell: “The transmission of such a price-list does not amount to an offer to supply an unlimited quantity of the wine described at the price named, so that as soon as an order is given there is a binding contract to supply that quantity. If it were so, the merchant might find himself involved in any number of contractual obligations to supply wine of a particular description which he could be quite unable to carry out, his stock of wine of that description being necessarily limited.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-The value which is being upheld here is business sense, or commercial convenience. Merchants must be able to alert prospective purchasers to their presence in the market without the risk of ending up bound to perform an impossible multiplicity of contracts from a limited stock. However, convincing though that reasoning may be, does it flout any other interest? Surely that of a prospective purchaser, who receives what is effectively an inducement to buy, duly places an order, and finds himself without any remedy in contract law if the order is not supplied. 
/->-The rejoinder to such a person's complaint would be framed in terms of the objective test of contractual intention. A reasonable individual in his position would not have imagined that the wine merchant was making an offer to sell, because he would have judged the matter contextually and envisaged the difficulties which Lord Herschell spells out.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_How satisfactory a response would this be? If the law had taken a different view of the status of advertisements, wine merchants and others would quickly have learnt that they had only to insert the words “subject to availability” into their price-lists to be fully protected. Trade could be accomplished more expeditiously, because there would be no need for acknowledgment of the customer's order, and the customer would be better protected. The competing merits of the law as it stands and as it might have developed seem fairly finely balanced. *Treitel* envisages that in special circumstances the general rule might be disapplied. Commenting on Grainger & Sons v Gough, he suggests (footnote to para 2-010) “quaere whether a price-list sent on request to a single customer could be an offer”._
/->-_However there is a further rationale for the usual view of advertisements as mere invitations to treat. It was memorably expressed in a nineteenth century case when counsel submitted to Parke B that “if a man advertises goods at a certain price, I have a right to go into his shop and demand the article at the price marked”. Parke B replied: “No; if you do, he has a right to turn you out”. The merchant has an interest in being the offeree rather than the offeror, and therefore in being free to accept or reject offers made to him. By the time of the following case, however, it is the interest of the customer which drives the decision._

NAME Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd
CITATION Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd [1953] 1 QB 401
CATEGORY Offers; (A) Generally
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Boots, the defendants, ran a self-service shop in which certain drugs were laid out on shelves to which shoppers had access. They selected the goods they wished to buy, placed them in a wire basket, and paid for them at a till, where a registered pharmacist oversaw the transaction and was authorised to prevent a customer from buying a product. Boots was prosecuted under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933, s 18 (1), which provided that it was unlawful to sell items scheduled by the Act “unless the sale [was] effected by or under the supervision of, a registered pharmacist”. The Court of Appeal held that the offence had not been committed, since the sale took place at the till and was therefore duly supervised.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-Since the Act's reference to “sale” is naturally understood to mean “contract of sale” (see the discussion of <i>Partridge v Crittenden</i> and <i>Fisher v Bell</i> above) the disposal of this case required the Court of Appeal to decide at what point offer and acceptance came together to constitute the contract of sale. Therefore the judgments turn upon express discussion of the nature and timing of invitation to treat, as well as offer and acceptance, in this type of shopping.
/->-The plaintiffs contended that the goods on the shelves constituted an offer which customers accepted by selecting them and placing them in the baskets provided. The Court of Appeal held that this was incorrect; the display of goods amounted to an invitation to treat. It was therefore the customer who offered to buy by presenting selected goods at the till, and the cashier who accepted that offer by ringing up the price of the goods. The consequence of accepting the plaintiffs' argument was explained by Somervell LJ: “The Lord Chief Justice, I think, expressed one of the most formidable difficulties in the way of the plaintiffs' contention when he pointed out that, if the plaintiffs are right, once an article has been placed in the receptacle the customer himself is bound and would have no right, without paying for the first article, to substitute an article which he later saw of a similar kind and which he perhaps preferred. I can see no reason for implying from this self-service arrangement any implication other than that which the Lord Chief Justice found in it, namely, that it is a convenient method of enabling customers to see what there is and choose, and possibly put back and substitute, articles which they wish to have, and then to go up to the cashier and offer to buy what they have so far chosen. On that conclusion the case fails, because it is admitted that there was supervision in the sense required by the Act and at the appropriate moment of time”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_The established case-law on the status of advertisements and displays of goods leads directly to the conclusion of the court in the Boots case. However, the judges do not confine themselves to following precedent, but go further to analyse the mechanics of self-service shopping. Although it is never expressly stated, there is a matter of great importance at stake here and it informs the analysis. This type of shopping, still fairly new at the time of the litigation, is clearly convenient (Somervell LJ's description). Its development furthers trade. It has to be made to work in legal terms. _
/->-_A court which failed to make it work would be neglecting its responsibility. Had the case-law suggested that the display of goods was an offer, and that the customer would be bound the moment he took possession of an item, it would have obstructed the development of a trading model which – as it turns out – was so convenient that it was to revolutionise the retail industry. Had it been necessary, a competent court would probably have broken away from inconvenient precedents to reach a decision which enabled self-service trade to go ahead without legal hindrance._
/->-_However, some interesting if minor problems do remain, and are worth considering from a legal standpoint. Poole (Casebook on Contract Law) asks “What is the position if there is a non-self-service counter inside a supermarket? For example, I request that a joint of beef be cut to my specifications but before I reach the cash desk I change my mind. Has a contract of sale already been concluded?”_
/->-_Not every display of goods is regarded legally as an invitation to treat, however. You will notice that the court's analysis in the <i>Boots</i> case works because (on a very simple level) there are enough stages to the transaction to accommodate the three divisions of the invitation/offer/acceptance analysis. Where there are less than three stages, something has to give. Therefore, as the next case quite memorably establishes, vending machines cannot be categorised as invitations to treat even though they would seem remarkably like displays of goods._




NAME Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking
CITATION Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking [1971] 2 QB 163
CATEGORY Offers; (A) Generally
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-This is primarily a case on the incorporation of terms into contracts, but that topic is closely linked to the analysis of contract formation. A motorist drove up to the entrance of a car-park. As he did so, a light changed from red to green, and a machine provided a ticket which the motorist took before driving on. In denying that exclusionary words printed on the ticket could be regarded as terms of the contract, Lord *Denning MR* explained that the ticket came after the contract was already complete. Therefore, according to basic principles, the ticket could not modify it.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Lord Denning gave the following account of the mechanics of contract formation in this situation: “The customer pays his money and gets a ticket. He cannot refuse it. He cannot get his money back. He may protest to the machine, even swear at it. But it will remain unmoved. He is committed beyond recall. He was committed at the very moment when he put his money into the machine. The contract was concluded at that time. It can be translated into offer and acceptance in this way: the offer is made when the proprietor of the machine holds it out as being ready to receive the money. The acceptance takes place when the customer puts his money into the slot”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_To explain this result, as I did earlier, by pointing out that there are not enough stages to allow for a three-part model of contract formation is not wrong, but it is not the most trenchant of analyses. It would be better to view the matter as follows. In the Thornton scenario, there is only one moment at which a choice is made. That choice has to be labelled the acceptance, because there can be no acceptance without conscious choosing. Any analysis, in any circumstances, which fails to match a purported acceptance to a factual choice, must be wrong as a matter of principle._
/->-_Does it matter that the Thornton analysis leaves no room for an invitation to treat? No; as stated earlier, invitations to treat for most purposes have no legal status, and the process of contract formation can perfectly well begin with the making of an offer out of the blue._
/->-_Treat the next case as an exercise. More than one analysis could be applied to the facts. The correct analysis is presumably the one which is best adapted to common sense, commercial convenience, and principle. That is not to say that a perfect solution will be available. A balance may have to be struck._

NAME Chapelton v Barry Urban District Council
CITATION Chapelton v Barry Urban District Council [1940] 1 KB 532
CATEGORY Offers; (A) Generally
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Again, this is a case which is chiefly concerned with the incorporation of terms into contracts, but again that is a matter very closely connected with contract formation. The Council let out deck chairs on a beach. The charge was displayed on a notice by a pile of deck chairs, together with the information that tickets could be obtained from an attendant. The plaintiff sat on a deck chair, which gave way and caused him injury. The Council sought to defend itself by reference to exclusionary words printed on the ticket available from the attendant.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-The question here is whether the contract is concluded before or after the customer has the opportunity to see the ticket and its wording. The answer to that question depends on which of the following analyses is correct. (1) The pile of deck chairs is an invitation to treat. The customer makes an offer by sitting down on one of them. The deck chair attendant accepts that offer when he comes round to collect the customer's money and provides the ticket. (2) The pile of deck chairs is an offer (there is no invitation to treat). The customer accepts by sitting down on a deck chair. The ticket, when it comes, is post-contractual, and can be regarded as a mere receipt. Its wording therefore has no legal effect.
/->-In the first of these accounts, the pile of deck chairs is not difficult to compare with the display of goods in a shop window. There are enough stages to the transaction to match the acceptance with an act of choice by the attendant. However, the first account is not correct.
/->-The court regarded the pile of deck chairs as the offer and the act of sitting down on one of them as the acceptance. The reason was that a customer might sit for an hour or more before the attendant came round for the money. On the first analysis, the customer would be free to get up and walk away at any point without being required to pay (his offer would not yet have been accepted). Perhaps even as the deck chair attendant approached.... Would deck chairs conveniently be provided in public places if that were the law? 
/->-You will see that there is room for a little imagination in matching the offer and acceptance analysis to new facts, even though decided cases may give a firm steer in one direction.
/->-Before we turn to consider the way the mechanics of contract formation work in a slightly different factual context (cases involving land) there is a further important category of cases to study. They may often involve advertisements, but work differently from the authorities we have looked at so far. In fact they are regarded as a completely different type of contractual arrangement – the “unilateral contract”. The next decision, which is the leading authority on this category, is also one of the most famous cases in English contract law. 




NAME Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company
CITATION Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company [1893] 1 QB 256
CATEGORY Offers; (B) In Unilateral Contracts
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The defendants placed an advertisement in the Pall Mall Gazette, inviting people to purchase their product, the Carbolic Smoke Ball. This was a medical preparation which, as the advertisement explained, would protect its users against contracting influenza. The advertisement also stated that a reward of £100 would be paid to any person who caught influenza despite using the smoke ball as directed, and that the company had deposited £1000 with their bankers “shewing our sincerity in this matter”. The plaintiff duly used the smoke ball, caught influenza, claimed the reward, and was refused it. The Court of Appeal, affirming the judgment at first instance, held that the Company was contractually obliged to pay.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-The aspect of this case which is chiefly relevant at the moment is the legal status of the Company's advertisement. As we have seen, advertisements of goods for sale are generally regarded as invitations to treat rather than offers. This advertisement proved to be an offer. In fact, within the context of the unilateral contract model, advertisements are generally regarded as offers. 
/->-To put it very simply, a unilateral contract is one in which the acceptance expected is not to take the form of assent, but of a specified action. This is often referred to as the model of “a promise for an act”. The offer usually is to pay money (or to confer some other benefit) if that action is performed.
/->-The difference between bilateral and unilateral contracts – a first look
/->-We will be examining some aspects of unilateral contracts in more detail later (in particular what constitutes completed acceptance), but a concise account of the fundamental difference between bilateral and unilateral models can be given here. In the bilateral contract, the parties reach an agreement, usually through the exchange of promises which at the moment we are discussing in terms of offer and acceptance. Once the acceptance is made, the parties are legally bound; each can rely on the other's future performance, because each will have a remedy in contract law if the other fails to perform. Bilateral contracts have occasionally been labelled “synallagmatic” contracts, because the parties are equally bound in law.
/->-The legal ramifications of unilateral contracts are rather different. Since acceptance takes the form of a specified action rather than the immediate giving of a return promise, there is no reaching of agreement, and the offeror is not bound until the required action is performed (or at least a start has been made upon its performance). Still more strikingly, the offeree is never bound to the offeror, and seems to be able to desist from performance at will. 
/->-Bilateral contracts have the great advantage of promoting certainty, because they make the other party's behaviour predictable. Unilateral contracts, by contrast, are better used to act as inducements to people to do what they might otherwise not think it worth their while to do. Unilateral contracts are sometimes known as “if” contracts, and tend to amount to this proposition; if you do the following specified act, I will give you a reward. In fact a good many unilateral contract cases concern the offer of rewards. In reward cases, in particular, the offeror may have no interest in who performs the specified act. The point is to provide an inducement generally so that the act is more likely to be performed. Thus offers of unilateral contracts are often “offers to the whole world”, advertised widely, which the person who performs the specified action will thereby accept.
/->-However, they do not have to be offers to the whole world. There are cases in which a promise is made to one party by another while some larger transaction is afoot. Where the promise is made conditional upon the performance of an act, rather than upon the communication of acceptance, it may be interpreted as the offer of a unilateral contract. It may bind the promisor when the act is performed even while the over-arching transaction is not yet complete. For examples, see the cases at the end of this lecture. 
/->-As attention moves from cases mainly concerned with displays of goods to cases whose subject matter is land, the rules of the analysis do not change. However, the focus very subtly does begin to shift, away from the timing of the offer, and towards the certainty and completeness which the law requires of a valid offer. The reason for that is that the intention to sell is not difficult to deduce in cases involving goods, price lists and advertisements; the important enquiry is when and how that intention is legally manifested. It is otherwise where the subject-matter of a deal is land. The courts traditionally regard land as unique and not so readily traded. An intention to sell land is not lightly imputed to its owner. The rules of offer and acceptance are arguably applied with a degree of caution to promote certainty and completeness in property dealings. In some of the decided cases, it may be questioned whether they are applied correctly.




NAME Harvey v Facey
CITATION Harvey v Facey [1893] AC 552
CATEGORY Offers; (C) In Contracts Involving Land
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The following series of telegrams concerning an estate in Jamaica passed between the parties. From H to F: “Will you sell us Bumper Hall Pen? Telegraph lowest cash price”. From F to H: “Lowest price for Bumper Hall Pen £900”. From H to F: “We agree to buy Bumper Hall Pen for the sum of nine hundred pounds asked by you. Please send us your title deed in order that we may get early possession”. Facey later declined to complete the sale. The Privy Council held that he could not be compelled to do so, since no contract had arisen from the exchange of telegrams. H had asked two questions, the first concerning F's willingness to sell, and the second as to price. F had answered only the second of those questions, and that communication could not therefore be regarded as an offer to sell. It followed that H's reply could not be construed as an acceptance.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-It would be mildly surprising if land could be bought and sold by an exchange as laconic as this (though we should bear in mind that the mode of communication precluded elaborate draftsmanship). And yet one may still wonder at the Privy Council's interpretation of Facey's reply to Harvey's first telegram. It was clear why Harvey was asking about the price. He wanted to buy. It was unclear why Facey would have stated the price in response to Harvey's telegram, unless he was content to sell. If he didn't want to sell, one would have expected him either not to reply, or to say “Bumper Hall Pen not for sale”. In the circumstances, and adopting the perspective of a reasonable person in Harvey's position, would you not have interpreted Facey's response as an offer capable of acceptance?




NAME Clifton v Palumbo
CITATION Clifton v Palumbo [1944] 2 All ER 497
CATEGORY Offers; (C) In Contracts Involving Land
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The plaintiff wrote to the defendant (without legal assistance) “I…am prepared to offer you or your nominee my Lyneham estate for £600,000… I also agree that a reasonable and sufficient time shall be granted to you for the examination and consideration of all the data and details necessary for the preparation of the Schedule of Completion”. The defendant later purported to accept this proposal. Held, by the Court of Appeal, that this was merely a preliminary statement as to price, rather than an offer capable of acceptance.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Lord Greene MR explained the court's view of the situation as follows: “There is nothing in the world to prevent an owner of an estate of this kind contracting to sell it to a purchaser, who is prepared to spend so large a sum of money, on terms written out on a half sheet of note paper of the most informal description and even, if he likes, on unfavourable conditions. But I think it is legitimate, when approaching the construction of a document of this kind, containing phrases and expressions of doubtful significance, to bear in mind that the probability of parties entering into so large a transaction, and finally binding themselves to a contract of this description couched in such terms, is remote. If they have done it, they have done it, however unwise and however unbusinesslike it may be. The question is, Have they done it?”.
/->-Lord Greene's statement focuses on the construction of the purported offer, since this was the question for the court's determination. The editor of the All England Reports, providing a comment on the decision, lays more emphasis on the context of the transaction: “The word “offer” when used in relation to price by one of the parties to negotiations for the sale of property is not necessarily used as indicating the intention to make a contract on acceptance by the other party. It may be only one element in protracted discussions and its precise effect will depend on the construction of the particular document in which it appears, together with a consideration of the surrounding circumstances. Here it was used by a layman in reference to a large and complicated deal in real property. The document also contained a reference to the preparation of a “schedule of completion” and this is construed to mean the formal contract upon which the solicitors were actually engaged. The letter containing the word “offer” therefore did not amount to a binding offer to sell”.




NAME Gibson v Manchester City Council
CITATION Gibson v Manchester City Council [1978] 1 WLR 520
CATEGORY Offers; (C) In Contracts Involving Land
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Pursuant to its policy of selling its council housing to tenants, the council sent Mr Gibson a letter stating that “the corporation may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price of £2725…”. The letter provided that it was not to be regarded as a firm offer of a mortgage, and went on: “If you would like to make a formal application to buy your council house, please complete the enclosed application form and return it to me as soon as possible”. Mr Gibson filled in the form but left the purchase price blank, asking that certain necessary repairs should be taken into account to diminish the price. The council replied that the state of the property had already been taken into account in the fixing of the price. Mr Gibson then wrote back on 18 March asking to proceed with the purchase in accordance with his original application. Political control of the council later changed and the new policy was that sales would be completed only where the council was legally obliged to proceed. Mr Gibson sought an order of specific performance, obtained it in the Court of Appeal, but lost on the council's appeal to the House of Lords. No binding contract had come into existence. The council's letter to Mr Gibson did not evince the intention to be bound by his acceptance, because of the words “may be prepared to…”, and its reference to a formal application to buy. It was no more than an invitation to treat.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-The Court of Appeal decision in this case, which was favourable to Mr Gibson, included a significant and well-known judgment of Lord *Denning*'s for which he was to be criticised in the House of Lords. The salient passage is this: “We have had much discussion as to whether Mr Gibson's letter of 18<sup>th</sup> March was a new offer or whether it was an acceptance of the previous offer which had been made. I do not like detailed analyses on such a point. To my mind it is a mistake to think that all contracts can be analysed into the form of offer and acceptance. I know in some of the textbooks it has been the custom to do so; but, as I understand the law, there is no need to look for a strict offer and acceptance. You should look at the correspondence as a whole and at the conduct of the parties and see therefrom whether the parties have come to an agreement on everything that was material. If by their correspondence and their conduct you can see an agreement on all material terms, which was intended thenceforward to be binding, then there is a binding contract in law even though all the formalities have not been gone through. For that proposition I would refer to <i>Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Co</i>.” (Note that Brogden's case involved not land, but coal, and an arrangement on which the parties had acted for two years).
/->-In the House of Lords, Lord *Diplock* had replied to Lord Denning's remarks in these terms: “My Lords, there may be certain types of contract, though I think they are exceptional, which do not fit easily into the normal analysis of a contract being constituted by offer and acceptance; but a contract alleged to have been made by an exchange of correspondence between the parties in which the successive communications other than the first are in reply to one another is not one of these. I can see no reason in the instant case for departing from the conventional approach of looking at the handful of documents relied on as constituting the contract sued on and seeing whether on their true construction there is to be found in them a contractual offer by the council to sell the house to Mr Gibson and an acceptance of that offer by Mr Gibson. I venture to think that it was by departing from this conventional approach that the majority of the Court of Appeal was led into error”.
/->-A tension runs through these cases, between on the one hand construing the documents (a narrow view), and on the other hand taking account of context, likelihood, and the overall look of what was going on (a broad view, of course). Linda Mulcahy and John Tillotson, in <i>Contract Law in Perspective</i>, attractively capture these competing views: “Denning is looking for the presence of a cake whereas those adopting a more formalistic analysis have looked for the ingredients of the cake and whether they have been put together in a “correct” sequence”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_Ideally, both perspectives should work together, and there should be no tension. On a broad view, it was apparent that the City Council and Mr Gibson both wished to bring about a sale of the council house at the stated price. One might begin from the assumption that since that was what they obviously wanted, it is more likely than not that what they said to each other achieved their aim as a matter of law. If it didn't, there may be something wrong with the law. _
/->-_Lord Diplock, quite correctly looking for the “ingredients of the cake” to see if the cake itself is present, emphasises the cautious words “may be prepared to”. An arch-formalist, ingredient-seeking view would surely note that “may” and “prepared to” are doing the same semantic job, but slightly interfere with each other in the course of it. The council manifestly is prepared to sell Mr Gibson the house; to add that it “may” be prepared to do so simply gainsays the council's then policy on the sale of council houses. This is not the best draftsmanship, so should the result of the litigation really turn on it as the key to the council's intention? Note that it would have made no sense in the context to state that the council “will” sell the house, because that would presuppose the certainty of Mr Gibson's acceptance of the deal. No, once it appears that the parties may not have used language with scientific precision, a broader view should be taken to discover the reality of the situation._
/->-_The broader view would note that the transaction was begun by the council sending Mr Gibson details of its sales scheme, and inviting him to fill in an application form if he was interested (invitations to treat, of course). Mr Gibson had done so, and the letter containing the words “may be prepared to” was a response to his application. That letter included the price at which the council was willing to sell, and it was a price which already had factored into it the precise state of Mr Gibson's house. Their Lordships' finding that the willingness of the council to sell was still in doubt at this stage is gainsaid by the broader context of the dealings between the parties. “May be prepared to” is surely a mere form of words, not the happiest, which an official chose because he realised that “will” wouldn't make any sense pending Mr Gibson's reply. _
/->-_It is true that the Council's letter invited Mr Gibson to make a formal application to buy by completing a further application form, which he never did. But what missing ingredient of the contractual cake could that formal application have supplied?_
/->-_We are continuing to distinguish offers and invitations to treat, and more particularly to study the circumstances in which valid offers are recognised by the courts. In the area of auctions and tenders, however, there will sometimes be collateral processes of contract formation taking place at the same time as the main transaction. These are based on the unilateral contract model to which an introduction was given in discussion of <i>Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company</i>. You may want to re-read that material before you go further._

CITATION Payne v Cave (1789) 3 Durn & E 148
CATEGORY Offers; (D) In Auction Sales
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The plaintiff held that the defendant had bought his property at auction by making the highest bid for it. The defendant maintained that he had withdrawn his bid before the hammer fell. It was held that the defendant succeeded. The placing of a bid at auction is the making of an offer, and the fall of the auctioneer's hammer is the acceptance. Like any other offer, a bid at auction can be withdrawn before acceptance. This analysis is now statutorily codified by s 57 (2) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. 




NAME Warlow v Harrison
CITATION Warlow v Harrison (1859) 1 E & B 309
CATEGORY Offers; (D) In Auction Sales
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-At an auction in Birmingham three horses were advertised as for sale “without reserve”. The plaintiff bid 60 guineas for one of the horses, but its current owner, who was present at the sale, promptly bid 61 guineas. The plaintiff refused to make any further bid. The horse was therefore “sold” to its owner (a legal impossibility). The plaintiff claimed that the horse was his since he had been the highest bona fide bidder. Held that since the sale had been advertised as being “without reserve”, the highest bidder was able to sue the auctioneer on a contract to that effect formed by the advertisement and the highest bid.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-Warlow v Harrison</i> is not the easiest of cases, because it calls for care in identifying the contract found by the court, and precision in charting the way in which that contract came into being. At the outset, notice that the plaintiff was not in a position to make good a claim that the horse had become his; his bid had not been accepted by the auctioneer. Instead, it is held (at least by a majority of the judges involved, and obiter) that the advertisement of the sale as being “without reserve” was an offer which had been accepted by the making of the highest bona fide bid. The auctioneer, by refusing to accept that bid, had breached a contract to the effect that the sale would be without reserve. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to damages for that breach, which would seem to equate to the damages he would have received if he had been able to maintain an action for breach of contract of sale. In fact he had pleaded his case on a different basis (not relevant for present purposes) on which he also succeeded.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_What kind of contract is the one envisaged by the majority, since the plaintiff never expressly accepted any offer made to him, and his offer was not accepted by the auctioneer? It is a unilateral contract – a promise made to whosoever should perform the action of making the highest bona fide bid. It can also be described as a collateral contract, in the sense that its making is intertwined with the stages by which an over-arching transaction progresses (though it was never completed) The decision shows that advertisements are by no means always without legal effect, but it should be compared with the next case._

CATEGORY Offers; (D) In Auction Sales
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The plaintiff, a London commission broker, attended an auction in Bury St Edmunds with a commission to bid for office furniture which had been advertised as for sale. The furniture was withdrawn from the auction. The plaintiff brought an action for breach of contract claiming his expenses in attending the auction. The court held that no such contract had come into existence.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-Why did the court refuse to find a contract here arising from a statement about the forthcoming auction, when it had done so in <i>Warlow v Harrison</i>? The mechanism by which a contract might arise would be precisely the same; the advertisement could be regarded as the offer of a unilateral contract which the plaintiff, by attending the auction, had accepted.
/->-The answer is based on policy and convenience rather than logic. In <i>Warlow v Harrison</i>, it is only the highest bidder who can perform the act required to make the offer of the unilateral contract binding; there can be only one highest bidder and therefore only one action for breach of contract. In <i>Harris v Nickerson</i>, every person attending the auction would have been enabled to sue the auctioneer for damages had a contract arisen from the advertisement of the goods for sale. The reasoning resembles that in <i>Grainger & Sons v Gough</i>. It is a proper object of the law to protect people in business from indeterminate liability




NAME Barry v Davies
CITATION Barry v Davies [2000] 1 WLR 1962
CATEGORY Offers; (D) In Auction Sales
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Two machines, obtainable from their manufacturer at a price of £14,521, were put up for sale at auction without reserve by Customs and Excise. The auctioneer attempted but failed to obtain bids of £5000 and £3000 for them. The claimant then bid £200 for each machine, but the auctioneer refused to accept these bids and withdrew the machines from the sale. The claimant sued the auctioneer for breach of contract, arguing that the holding of an auction without reserve amounts to an offer to sell to the highest bidder which he had accepted by making his bids. The Court of Appeal, applying the obiter dictum in <i>Warlow v Harrison</i>, held that this was correct. The claimant was entitled to damages of £27,600 for breach of that unilateral contract.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-This case shows how close a collateral, unilateral contract can come to taking over from the main contract in a bilateral transaction, and confirms what <i>Warlow v Harrison</i> strongly suggested. The bilateral contract of sale would have been concluded at auction by the bid and the auctioneer's acceptance of it, had the auctioneer not stopped short of making that contract. Nevertheless, its place is all but taken by the unilateral contract which arises when the sale is described as without reserve, and the bidder makes the highest bid. Damages for the breach of the unilateral contract are the same as they would be had the bilateral contract of sale been made and breached. 
/->-You will notice that for the purposes of the bilateral contract the holding of the auction is an invitation to treat, and all bids made at it are offers. For the purposes of the collateral, unilateral contract, the holding of the auction is an offer, and the making of the highest bid is its acceptance. 




NAME Spencer v Harding
CITATION Spencer v Harding (1870) LR 5 CP 561
CATEGORY Offers; (E) In Sales By Tender
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-A circular advertised that a company's stock in trade was to be offered for sale, and invited bidders to submit tenders for its purchase at a discount to a stated valuation. The tenders were to be opened together at a stated time and place. Payment was to be made in cash by the successful bidder. The plaintiffs claimed that they had put in the highest tender, and the defendants were in breach of contract in refusing to sell to them. The court held that no contract had come into existence. The circular could not be construed as an offer to sell to the highest bidder.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Counsel for the plaintiffs in this case attempted to distinguish it from tendering procedures for building contracts. There, he submitted, the price of the bid is not the sole factor by which the successful bidder is chosen, because it is always subject to the architect's judgment as to the character and capacity of the builder. This case was different, because there was no such judgment to be exercised, and this was supported by the circular's reference to payment in cash. Therefore this case amounted to the offer of a unilateral contract, to be compared to the reward cases. Rejecting this analysis, Willes J said that it would have been apposite if the defendants had expressly bound themselves to accept the highest bid. He went on: “But the question is, whether there is here any offer to enter into a contract at all, or whether the circular amounts to anything more than a mere proclamation that the defendants are ready to chaffer for the sale of the goods, and to receive offers for the purchase of them. In advertisements for tenders for buildings, it is not usual to say that the contract will be given to the lowest bidder, and it is not always that the contract is made with the lowest bidder. Here there is a total absence of any words to intimate that the highest bidder is to be the purchaser. It is a mere attempt to ascertain whether an offer can be obtained within such a margin as the sellers are willing to adopt”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_The rule in Spencer v Harding is not open to serious doubt, but the case doesn't seem quite as open and shut as it is often thought to be. _
/->-_ Had there been any implication to be drawn from the circular that the stock in trade would be sold to the highest bidder, the unilateral contract device described by counsel for giving contractual effect to that promise would have achieved it. Willes J expressly confirms this. Smith & Thomas's Casebook on Contract asks of the case “Would a reasonable reader of the circular have supposed that the defendants intended to make any binding promise? Was it reasonable to suppose that the defendants intended to bind themselves to sell to the highest bidder, however low that bid might be?” Well, the circular stated that the defendants were instructed to offer the stock for sale. Of course that is far from determinative. The tenders were to be opened at a stated time on a given day. That would provide a cut-off point, showing that the defendants were serious about selling the stock and were not merely “ready to chaffer for the sale”. The stipulation for cash reinforces that view; there was to be no chaffering about payment terms by the successful bidder. These were obviously sealed bids, which gave the defendants some protection against being forced to sell at a depressed price; the bidders would each be stating their best price and hoping it would be at a (minimal) premium to what others were prepared to pay. There was no reference to any residual discretion on the part of the defendants to abort the procedure. It has every appearance of a means of achieving, without more, a sale at the best price possible._
/->-_The appearance which a bidding process would have for reasonable people was one of the determining factors in the next case._




NAME Blackpool and Fylde Aeroclub Ltd v Blackpool Borough Council
CITATION Blackpool and Fylde Aeroclub Ltd v Blackpool Borough Council [1990] 1 WLR 1195
CATEGORY Offers; (E) In Sales By Tender
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The plaintiff company held a concession to operate pleasure flights, granted by the borough council in 1975 and twice renewed. In 1983 the council contacted the company, amongst others, inviting the submission of tenders to operate the concession for a further period. The invitation stated: “The council do not bind themselves to accept all or any part of any tender. No tender which is received after the last date and time specified shall be admitted for consideration”. The company submitted a tender before the deadline, but as a result of the council's mistake it was recorded as arriving late and was not considered. The concession was awarded to another bidder (whose bid was lower than that of the plaintiff, but the higher of the two remaining and “valid” bids). The Court of Appeal held that the invitation to submit tenders was the offer of a unilateral contract accepted by the submission of a conforming tender, and that the council was liable to the company in damages for the breach of that contract.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-The council made four submissions. The first, based on <i>Spencer v Harding</i>, was that the invitation to tender was merely an invitation to treat, and not an offer. The second was that the invitation did not state that all tenders would be considered. The third was that the test for the implication of a contract could be no less rigorous than the test for the implication of a term into a contract; it needed to be necessary, and not merely reasonable. The fourth submission, resting upon the other three, was that although the parties might each have assumed that conforming tenders would be considered, they had not contracted to that effect. It would distort the principles of contract formation if the court, out of desire to remedy a perceived injustice, were to find that they had.
/->-*Bingham LJ* stated that he found great force in these arguments, and had been persuaded by them for much of the hearing, but had ultimately rejected them. He gives his reasons in the following passage:
/->-“A tendering procedure of this kind is, in many respects, heavily weighted in favour of the invitor. He can invite tenders from as many or as few parties as he chooses. He need not tell any of them who else, or how many others, he has invited. The invitee may often, although not here, be put to considerable labour and expense in preparing a tender, ordinarily without recompense if he is unsuccessful. The invitation to tender may itself, in a complex case, although again not here, involve time and expense to prepare, but the invitor does not commit himself to proceed with the project, whatever it is; he need not accept the highest tender; he need not accept any tender; he need not give reasons to justify his acceptance or rejection of any tender received. The risk to which the tenderer is exposed does not end with the risk that his tender may not be the highest (or, as the case may be, lowest). But where, as here, tenders are solicited from selected parties all of them known to the invitor, and where a local authority's invitation prescribes a clear, orderly and familiar procedure (draft contract conditions available for inspection and plainly not open to negotiation, a prescribed form of tender, the supply of envelopes designed to protect the absolute anonymity of tenderers and clearly to identify the tender in question and an absolute deadline) the invitee is in my judgment protected at least to this extent: if he submits a confirming tender before the deadline he is entitled, not as a matter of mere expectation but of contractual right, to be sure that his tender will after the deadline be opened and considered in conjunction with all other conforming tenders or at least that his tender will be considered if others are. Had the club, before tendering, inquired of the council whether it could rely on any timely and confirming tender being considered along with others, I feel quite sure that the answer would have been “of course”. The law would, I think, be defective if it did not give effect to that.
/->-It is, of course, true that the invitation to tender does not explicitly state that the council will consider timely and conforming tenders. That is why one is concerned with implication. But the council does not either say that it does not bind itself to do so, and in the context a reasonable invitee would understand the invitation to be saying, quite clearly, that if he submitted a timely and conforming tender it would be considered, at least if any other such tender were considered”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_The four, forceful submissions made on behalf of the council ultimately depend on one proposition; the council's invitation did not contain any promise. This, according to Bingham LJ, is its downfall; the argument proves too much. If it is correct, then it would leave the council at liberty to open the first tender received, before the deadline, and ignore the rest. Alternatively, the council might validly award the concession to a tender received well after the deadline had passed. Bingham LJ could not accept that the council retained the freedom to act in these ways, and said that if it did, “there would in my view be an unacceptable discrepancy between the law of contract and the confident assumptions of commercial parties…”._
/->-_To engage more closely with a case, often one should be ready not only to attend to the details but also to take a broad view of what is going on. Yes, the council's submissions are cogent ones, but to gain a victory in these circumstances they would have had to have been quite overwhelming. Justice was entirely on the side of the company, which had done exactly what the council invited it to, only to find that it had wasted its time because of the council's own mistake._
/->-_Before leaving Blackpool v Fylde, notice the mechanics of liability in this case. The status of the invitation sent by the council differs according to whether it is the substantive or the collateral contract which is under consideration. For the purposes of the substantive contract (the award of the concession) it is an invitation to treat, and the conforming tenders are offers. For the purposes of the collateral contract found by the Court of Appeal, the invitation to tender is an offer of a unilateral contract, which is accepted by all those who submit conforming tenders. Give thought also to the measure of damages to which the plaintiff company would be entitled for breach of the collateral contract. It could not be the total profits to be made from operating the concession, since it was not certain that the company's bid would have been accepted even if it had been considered. It would have been a proportion of that profit representing the likelihood of its winning the concession (commonly called “loss of a chance”), or alternatively, its expenses in putting together its bid (reliance loss)._

CITATION Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust of Canada Ltd [1986] AC 207
CATEGORY Offers; (E) In Sales By Tender
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The Royal Trust invited two parties, Harvela and Sir Leonard Outerbridge, to submit sealed bids for a parcel of shares by a fixed date. They stated that they would accept the highest bid. Harvela offered $2,175,000. Sir Leonard offered “$2,100,000 or $101,000 in excess of any other offer…whichever is the higher amount”. The Royal Trust accepted Sir Leonard's bid, considering that it was bound to do so. Held, by the House of Lords (reversing the Court of Appeal) that Sir Leonard's bid was invalid, so that Harvela's was the winner. 
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-This case perhaps does not deserve the prominence it has in some books. Certainly, the complexities caused by Sir Leonard's “referential” bid are not of much relevance for present purposes. The outcome can simply be explained by reference to the unilateral contract mechanism, once again; the Royal Trust's invitation was the offer of a unilateral contract (to sell to the highest bidder) and was accepted by the submission of the highest bid. That being said, the case is a good opportunity to revise the role of the unilateral contract element within a bidding process.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_Smith & Thomas's Casebook on Contract fastens on an interesting point, when the following question is posed: “What does [Lord Templeman] mean when he says that referential bids are not “permissible”? Are they illegal?” _
/->-_The point may be this; to what extent can the invitation to receive bids condition the validity of the bids received? As long as the invitation is regarded as the offer of a unilateral contract, it can lay down conditions for the validity of the responses to be received, as can any offer. But in the speech of Lord Templeman, a broader view seems to be taken, on which the invitation qualifies the validity of bids simply by being the first shot in the match. There are some suggestions of this in the Blackpool case as well, introduced by references to “conforming” tenders. _
/->-_An invitation to receive bids is normally understood to be a mere invitation to treat, although for some purposes of course it can also be the offer of a unilateral contract. Where it lays down complex conditions of validity, is it still in any sense just an invitation to treat? Can an invitation to treat determine the question of whether a response to it counts as an offer or not?_
/->-_The problem of deciding whether controlling power belongs to the first or to subsequent shots in the match will be considered in detail in the next lecture. _
