/->-_The mere fact that an offer has been made by one party to negotiations to the other will not create binding obligations. It is possible to lose sight of this basic principle where an offer is made in emphatically promissory language. Even if an offer is worded in such a way as to suggest that the offeror will act in accordance with it, come what may, the offeror is not legally obliged to do so unless and until the offer is accepted. _
/->-_The reason for this ought to be briefly stated here; you will be looking at the underlying legal principle in greater detail soon. The offer does not bind its maker until acceptance has converted it into an agreement not only (a) because it might be said that the parties are not yet <i>ad idem</i> on the objective view which the law adopts, but also (b) because no <i>consideration</i> has yet moved from offeree to offeror. The law of consideration will be examined in detail later this term. For the timebeing, “consideration” can be understood as “something of value, moving from the offeree”._

SUMMARY ~*Counter-Offer*~
/->-Various things may happen to the offer to prevent it being accepted. It may, of course, be rejected outright, in which case it terminates. What will be the position, however, if the offeree responds in a broadly positive sense, but proposes terms which conflict with those of the offeror? This will stand as a counter-offer. It puts an end to the original offer, but it may itself be accepted by the party to which it is addressed.




NAME Hyde v Wrench
CITATION Hyde v Wrench (1840) 3 Beav 334
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Counter-Offer
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-This was an action for specific performance, involving negotiations for the sale of a farm. The defendant wrote to the plaintiff offering to sell him his farm for £1000. The plaintiff's agent replied saying that the plaintiff would buy it for £950. The defendant later wrote to say that he would not sell at that price. The plaintiff then wrote to say that he would buy for £1000. Specific performance was refused, since there was no concluded contract of sale. The proposal to buy for £950 was a counter-offer; it had terminated the original offer so that the plaintiff's purported acceptance of it later was no more than a fresh offer.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_You may be thinking that if one adopts Lord *Denning*'s broad approach to the construction of contractual negotiations (stated by him in the Court of Appeal in Gibson's case), it is apparent that buyer and seller are effectively in agreement here. However, the conventional analysis gives a different result. One might conclude that the conventional analysis is therefore wrong, and a victim of its own formalism. Bear in mind, though, that had the defendant still been content to sell his farm to the plaintiff for the original price once the plaintiff finally offered it, all he needed to do to close the deal on those terms was to write back to accept. He did not do so. The conventional analysis reveals that however close the parties came to agreeing, they did not agree._

NAME Stevenson, Jacques & Co v MacLean
CITATION Stevenson, Jacques & Co v MacLean (1880) 5 QBD 346
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Counter-Offer
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-McLean, the defendant, wrote on Saturday to Stevenson offering to sell a large quantity of warrants for iron for 40 shillings a ton, the offer to be open until Monday [seemingly the end of Monday]. On Monday, Stevenson replied asking “whether you would accept forty for delivery over two months, or if not, longest limit you would give”. On receipt of this reply, McLean sold the iron to a third party. In the ensuing minutes, and before McLean informed Stevenson that the iron was sold, Stevenson affirmed that he would pay 40 shillings a ton. McLean sought to defend an action for breach of contract by arguing that Stevenson's enquiry about delivery times had terminated the original offer, so that it was no longer on the table when Stevenson purported to accept it. Held that Stevenson's enquiry had not been a counter-offer. His later telegram was therefore acceptance of the original offer. 
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-In Lush J's explanation of the grounds for his decision there are a couple of odd expressions for which I have suggested preferable readings: “It is apparent throughout the correspondence, that the plaintiffs did not contemplate buying the iron on speculation, but that their acceptance of the defendant's offer depended on their finding someone to take the warrants off their hands. All parties knew that the market was in an unsettled state, and that no one could predict at the early hour when the telegram was sent how the prices would range during the day. It was reasonable that, under these circumstances, they should desire to know before business began whether they were to be at liberty in case of need to make <i>[read “obtain”]</i> any concession as to the time or times of delivery, which would be the times of payment, or whether the defendant was determined to adhere to the terms of his letter; and it was highly unreasonable <i>[read “unlikely]</i> that the plaintiffs should have intended to close the negotiation while it was uncertain whether they could find a buyer or not, having the whole of the business hours of the day to look for one. Then, again, the form of the telegram is one of inquiry. It is not like “I offer forty for delivery over two months,” which would have likened the case to <i>Hyde v Wrench</i>…. Here there is no counter proposal….There is nothing specific by way of offer or rejection, but a mere inquiry, which should have been answered and not treated as a rejection of the offer”.
/->-Notice the two grounds on which the decision is based – the context of the negotiation, and the form and substance of Stevenson's response. Sometimes, in explanations of counter-offer analysis, the importance of context is not sufficiently stressed. This was a volatile market, and Stevenson, as purchaser, had the complex task of balancing the price being asked against the ease (or otherwise) with which the warrants could be sold on. In these circumstances, an understandable request for further information should have been treated as just that, and not as the proposal of a different deal.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look *~
/->-_It will be apparent that in some circumstances it may not be easy to distinguish between a counter offer and a request for further information. When attempting to draw the distinction correctly, you may want to bear in mind the potentially drastic consequence of labelling a communication as a counter offer, and check that this is a reasonable way of describing what has occurred. Remember that a counter offer does not merely fall short of an acceptance. In law it is a rejection of the original offer, and terminates it. Does the offeree really mean to reject the original offer in all its respects, to replace it by a proposal of his own? Possibly; but the effect which the traditional analysis gives to counter offers makes a negotiation look curiously like a prize fight. Some negotiations are like that, but many are not. Always consider the context._
/->-_We have already looked at a case in which there is a live issue as to whether a counter-offer is being made or not. Here are the facts of <i>Gibson</i>'s case again, in case you want to refresh your memory. If you are already familiar with them, skip to the discussion below. It is well worth forming your own view on the issue, because two senior judges were in disagreement over it._




NAME Gibson v Manchester City Council.
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Pursuant to its policy of selling its council housing to tenants, the council sent Mr Gibson a letter stating that “the corporation may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price of £2725…. The letter provided that it was not to be regarded as a firm offer of a mortgage, and went on: “If you would like to make a formal application to buy your council house, please complete the enclosed application form and return it to me as soon as possible”. Mr Gibson filled in the form but left the purchase price blank, asking that certain necessary repairs should be taken into account to diminish the price. The council replied that the state of the property had already been taken into account in the fixing of the price. Mr Gibson then wrote back on 18 March asking to proceed with the purchase in accordance with his original application. Political control of the council later changed and the new policy was that sales would be completed only where the council was legally obliged to proceed. Mr Gibson sought an order of specific performance, obtained it in the Court of Appeal, but lost on the council's appeal to the House of Lords. No binding contract had come into existence. The council's letter to Mr Gibson did not evince the intention to be bound by his acceptance, because of the words “may be prepared to…”, and its reference to a formal application to buy. It was no more than an invitation to treat.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-When Mr Gibson replied to the council, proposing that the price of the house should be diminished to take account of the need for repairs, was that a counter-offer? The precise words used by him were these: “Before the transaction is finalised I would appreciate your comments on the following. [There followed a complaint that, although the council's “direct works” department had undertaken to repair Mr Gibson's tarmac paths, nothing had been done.] I would therefore like your assurance that Direct Works will not exclude these premises when re-surfacing or re-laying starts, or alternatively would you deduct an amount of money from the purchase price and I will undertake the repairs myself. Whichever decision you arrive at I would like to make an initial cash payment of £500 – so I would be obliged if you will let me have the figures to allow for the deposit mentioned. I have left the purchase price blank on the application form until I hear from you”. 
/->-In the Court of Appeal Geoffrey Lane LJ (dissenting) made this comment on Mr Gibson's proposal: “What he is suggesting there in short is that the price of these premises to him should not be that which the council have put forward but that an allowance should be made for his repairing the drive or alternatively there should be an obligation on the council to make recompense to him in kind by repairing his drive themselves by direct labour. That seemed to me quite plainly to be a counter-offer”.
/->-In the House of Lords Lord Edmund Davies went the other way: “I am not, however, with Geoffrey Lane LJ in treating Mr Gibson's letter of 5<sup>th</sup> March 1971 (regarding non-repair of his tarmac paths) as a counter-offer which had the effect of destroying an offer to sell, if the council had made one. On the contrary, I read it as merely exploratory of the possibility of a reduction in price in the eventuality indicated. In other words, this case is like <i>Stevenson v McLean</i> and unlike <i>Hyde v Wrench</i>”.
/->-The concept of a counter-offer, terminating the original offer but itself open for acceptance, lies at the heart of the situation known as the “battle of the forms”. This occurs where parties do business together, but while appearing to go through the process of offer and acceptance, they exchange paperwork which in fact constitutes a written (and perhaps unwitting) dispute over whose terms are to govern the deal. 




NAME BRS v Arthur Crutchley Ltd
CITATION BRS v Arthur Crutchley Ltd [1968] 1 All ER 811
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Battle of Forms
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The plaintiffs' lorry, carrying a valuable load of whisky, was stolen while being stored overnight at the defendants' warehouse. The question arose whether the contract of bailment between the parties was made on the plaintiffs' or the defendants' conditions, since the latter included a limitation of liability to £800 per ton of goods. The contract was formed when the plaintiffs' driver brought his delivery note to the defendants' office; the note stated that “all goods are carried on the [plaintiffs'] conditions of carriage”. The defendants gave permission for the goods to be brought into the warehouse, but stamped the delivery note with the words “received under A.V.C conditions”. Held by the Court of Appeal that the defendants' conditions prevailed over those of the plaintiffs.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-The legal explanation for the decision is this. The giving in of the delivery note is an offer. However, the stamping of it by the other party is not an acceptance of that offer but a counter-offer, because of the discrepancy between the two sets of terms. The acceptance of this counter-offer is made by the plaintiff's driver when he drives the lorry into the warehouse. That is an <i>acceptance by conduct</i> – more will be said about this topic at the beginning of the next lecture.
/->-The <i>Arthur Crutchley</i> case is not a complex one on this point. It can be seen to apply a general principle; the latest shot in a battle of the forms tends to prevail, because the doctrine of counter-offer dictates that it represents the current offer on the table between the parties and terminates earlier ones. 
/->-However, the situation becomes somewhat more difficult and open to doubt when one party's paperwork claims to trump future inconsistent proposals prospectively.




NAME Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp
CITATION Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp [1979] 1 WLR 401
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Battle of Forms
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The sellers of a machine tool quoted a price for its delivery in ten months' time. On the back of their quotation (regarded as the offer) were various clauses including (a) a price escalation provision which would entitle them to demand an increased price if production costs increased; and (b) the statement that “all orders are accepted only upon and subject to the terms set out in our quotation and the following conditions. These terms and conditions shall prevail over any terms and conditions in the buyer's order”.
/->-The buyers placed an order which was expressed to be on their own terms and conditions, and varied the delivery date. There was a tear-off slip which was to be signed and sent back. It reiterated that the order was accepted on the buyers' own terms. The sellers signed and returned it.
/->-Upon delivery of the machine tool, the sellers sought to increase the price by reference to their price escalation clause. Held by the Court of Appeal that the buyers' terms governed, so that the sale was at the originally quoted price. The signing and return of the buyers' tear-off slip had made the contract on the buyers' terms.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-The mechanism producing this result is again a counter-offer. In the opinion of all three judges in the Court of Appeal (differing from the analysis of the judge at first instance), the buyers' order was so materially different from the sellers' offer that it could not be construed as an acceptance of it. Instead, it was a counter-offer which terminated it, and therefore also terminated the claim in that original offer that the sellers' terms should prevail over those of the buyer. By signing the tear-off slip, the sellers had (ostensibly) assented to that counter-offer. 
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_All three Court of Appeal judges emphasise that provisions in the buyers' order (eg. with regard to delivery date) materially differed from provisions in the sellers' quotation. As a result of that, it seems, the order is characterised as a counter-offer and therefore has the effect of terminating the sellers' offer. But is this analysis perhaps more complex than necessary? The buyers' order, by specifying that their terms would prevail, ran counter to the sellers' offer for that reason alone, and was therefore a counter-offer._




NAME Tekdata Interconnections Ltd v Amphenol Ltd
CITATION Tekdata Interconnections Ltd v Amphenol Ltd [2009] EWCA Civ 1209
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Battle of Forms
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The parties were buyers and sellers, respectively, of components destined for use in Rolls Royce aero engines, and had a business relationship of long standing. The buyers (Tekdata) claimed to have bought the components on the terms of their purchase orders, and complained that the goods were late and faulty. The sellers (Amphenol) claimed that the governing terms were their own, referred to on their acknowledgment of purchase orders, and limited or excluded their liability for breach.
/->-Held at first instance (HHJ Simon Brown QC) that the usual battle of the forms analysis was displaced here. Throughout the parties' relationship it had always been intended that Tekdata's terms should apply, since they contained stipulations as to time and quality without which this sophisticated manufacturing process would not have been carried on. Amphenol's appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal. The parties' intentions should have been deduced from what actually happened between them. It was impermissible in effect to disregard the reference to Amphenol's terms on the acknowledgment of purchase. The fact that Amphenol had not placed any reliance on its terms in correspondence after the dispute arose was of no obvious relevance. The general rule was that ordinary offer and acceptance analysis was to be applied to battle of the forms cases. 
/->-Up until the moment at which an offer is accepted, the offeror may withdraw it.




NAME Routledge v Grant
CITATION Routledge v Grant (1828) 4 Bing 653
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal of Offer (and Lapse)
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-This case concerned an offer by a prospective lessee to take a lease of the plaintiff's premises. The offer was to remain open for six weeks. Before the expiry of that period, the defendant withdrew the offer. Towards the end of the six week period, the plaintiff purported to accept the offer. Held, rejecting the plaintiff's claim to enforce a contract, that “if six weeks are given on one side to accept an offer, the other has six weeks to put an end to it” (Best CJ).
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-It may seem surprising that an offeror can expressly define the length of time for which he will keep an offer open, and then withdraw the offer during that period with impunity. No doubt many an offeree on the receiving end of such behaviour would resent it and wonder how it is legally permissible; he may have relied on having the full period in which to make up his mind, or why else would he have been informed of the offer's duration? The legally correct answer is no more than a restatement of the principle set out at the beginning of this lecture. The reason that such behaviour is permissible lies principally in the law of consideration. As a matter of legal doctrine, a promise does not bind its maker unless he requests and receives something in return for it (consideration). We will, of course, be looking in detail at the law of consideration later this term. Until that time, be sure to remember that a “gratuitous promise”, meaning one which is not given in exchange for anything, does not bind, however sincerely it is meant or emphatically expressed.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look *~
/->-_If you read the judgment in this case, you will see how completely it is imbued with the understanding of contract as mutuality of obligation. Best CJ does not refer expressly to the doctrine of consideration, but puts it more broadly; “one party cannot be bound without the other”. It is worth noting the date of the case – 1828. The unilateral contract model had not yet developed, and perhaps would have been rejected outright by Best CJ on the footing that it can (at least on one view) involve one party being bound while the other is not. This is more fully explored below: see Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees._
/->-_Note also the way in which the use of terminology has altered since the time of this judgment. Best CJ says that the defendant “repudiated the contract on April 9”. We would now regard that expression as unfortunate, since the whole point is that no form of contractual obligation ever came into existence. _




NAME Mountford v Scott
CITATION Mountford v Scott [1975] All ER 198
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal of Offer (and Lapse)
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The facts of this case bear comparison with those of <i>Routledge v Grant</i>. This was an offer to sell property, expressed to remain open for six months. However, the prospective purchaser paid £1 in return for this promise. Held that this consideration, although nominal, converted the offer into an option (a binding contract), so that the offeror was not free to withdraw it during the six month period.
/->-If an offer is to be effectively withdrawn, its revocation must be communicated to the offeree.




NAME Byrne & Co v Van Tienhoven
CITATION Byrne & Co v Van Tienhoven (1880) 5 CPD 344
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal of Offer (and Lapse)
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-On 1 October the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs, offering to sell them 1000 boxes of tinplates. During the following week, the price of tinplate rose sharply, and on 8 October the defendants wrote again to withdraw their offer. This letter reached the defendants on 20 October, but they had already telegraphed their acceptance of the offer on 11 October. Held that there was a contract. The acceptance had been made before the intended withdrawal had been communicated to the plaintiffs.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Lindley J held that the question whether withdrawal required communication to become effective was not covered by binding English authority. He examined various persuasive authorities (American law, academic writing and principles governing acceptance) and rejected the submission that an uncommunicated withdrawal was valid: “If the defendants' contention were to prevail no person who had received an offer by post and had accepted it would know his position until he had waited such a time as to be quite sure that a letter withdrawing the offer had not been posted before his acceptance of it. It appears to me that both legal principles, and practical convenience require that a person who has accepted an offer not know to him to have been revoked, shall be in a position safely to act upon the footing that the offer and acceptance constitute a contract binding on both parties”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look *~
/->-_This decision seems so obviously in accordance with practicality and fairness that you may wonder whether there are any arguments at all in favour of the offerors' (the defendants') contention. To the mind of an English common lawyer, perhaps not. However, this is an occasion on which the principle that the parties must be <b>ad idem</b> can be pressed into service to attempt to make the defendants' case. Of course there is no point at which they and the other side were <b>ad idem</b>. But the principle or ideal of being <b>ad idem</b> is tempered by English contract law's concern with objective appearances. To a reasonable person in the offeree's position, the parties appear to be <b>ad idem</b>, and it is that appearance which is determinative. _
/->-_Although withdrawal of offer must be communicated to the offeree, the communication need not be either formal or direct._




NAME Dickinson v Dodds
CITATION Dickinson v Dodds (1876) 2 Ch 463
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal of Offer (and Lapse)
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-This case concerned a written offer to sell certain houses to the plaintiff. It was expressed to be open until a stated deadline. The day before the deadline expired, the plaintiff was informed by somebody else that the offeror was now offering the property to a third party. In fact an agreement for sale was concluded with the third party on that day. The next day, the plaintiff purported to accept the offer before the deadline expired. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against the order for specific performance granted by the trial judge. No contract had come into being between the parties. The plaintiff had known, when he purported to accept, that the offeror was no longer minded to sell to him. In these circumstances, the offer had effectively been withdrawn.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-James LJ explained the principle on which he decided this case as follows: “It appears to me that there is neither principle or authority for the proposition that there must be an express and actual withdrawal of the offer, or what is called a retractation. It must, to constitute a contract, appear that the two minds were at one, at the same moment of time, that is, that there was an offer continuing up to the time of the acceptance. If there was not such a continuing offer, then the acceptance comes to nothing. Of course it may well be that the one man is bound in some way or other to let the other man know that his mind with regard to the offer has changed; but in this case, beyond all question, the Plaintiff knew that Dodds was no longer minded to sell the property to him as plainly and clearly as if Dodds had told him in so many words, “I withdraw the offer”. This is evident from the Plaintiff's own statements in the bill”.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-This case slots quite neatly into place provided it is seen in the same light as the “snapping up” cases which were covered in the last lecture. The plaintiff here is quite as unable to accept an offer which he knows no longer tallies with its maker's true intention as is an offeree who tries to snap up an offer which is clearly made by mistake.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_However, that is not quite the basis on which James LJ puts his judgment. Rather, the <b>ad idem</b> principle again makes an appearance; there must be at least a moment in time when the two parties are of the same mind, and here there is not. But nor was there any such moment in Byrne v Van Tienhoven, yet there a contract was found. Can the two cases be reconciled?_
/->-_They probably can. Certainly each seems to be rightly decided. In Byrne, the offeree accepts thinking that there is still an offer on the table. In Dickinson v Dodds, the offeree accepts thinking that there is probably not an offer on the table. Convenience and fairness justify the result in the first case. The principle lying behind the snapping up cases justifies the result in the second. They can be reconciled on the basis that both are expressions of the objective perspective on intention, limited always by the gloss that the objective view must be the one that is reasonable to take on the known facts._
/->-_There is more to be said about Dickinson v Dodds. It must have appeared on the evidence that the plaintiff knew the deal with the third party was as good as done. Otherwise, it is hard to explain why the mere knowledge that the property had been <b>offered </b>elsewhere should have fixed the plaintiff with the realisation that it was no longer being offered to him (this point is correctly taken in Beale, Bishop & Furmston's Contract Cases and Materials). Offers to sell the same property might quite well be made to more than one party, although this would be a risky tactic since it could result in multiple and mutually exclusive contracts. Casebook accounts of Dickinson v Dodds seem to understate how much the court must have found the plaintiff to know about the offeror's change of heart. For the correct account, see the final sentence in the quotation from James LJ's judgment above._
/->-_On a separate point, note the statement in Mellish LJ's judgment that “the sale of the property to Allan [the third party] was first in point of time”. This needs careful handling. One might conclude that the contract made first, where there are offers out to multiple offerees, takes precedence over later acceptances involving the same property. This is true as a matter of equity only (and Dickinson v Dodds was an action for the equitable remedy of specific performance). It is not true of common law, which takes no account of precedence. It regards mutually inconsistent contracts as equally valid, leaving up to the parties involved the choice of which to perform and which to breach. *Treitel*, at para 2-033, obscures this point, citing a case (Potter v Sanders) as if it established a general principle of precedence. It does not; the case is concerned only with an equitable remedy. _

NAME Shuey v United States
CITATION Shuey v United States (1865) 92 US 73
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal of Offer (and Lapse)
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The US Secretary of War published a proclamation in newspapers and elsewhere to the effect that a reward would be given for information leading to the arrest of named criminal suspects. No deadline for the receipt of the information was given. Seven months later, an order revoking the offer of reward was published. The following year, the claimant gave relevant information to the authorities. His claim for the reward failed before the US Supreme Court on the basis that it had been validly withdrawn, despite the fact that the withdrawal had not come to his notice.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-The claimant's unawareness that the offer of the reward had been withdrawn is described by Strong J as “an immaterial fact”. To assess this assertion in its context, one should bear in mind that many offers of unilateral contracts, like the one in this case, are made generally, to “the whole world”. There must be freedom to withdraw such an offer, because basic contractual principle dictates that any offer can be withdrawn provided it has not yet been accepted, and provided the offeror is not found to have contracted to keep the offer open. Since it would be impractical if not impossible to communicate the fact of withdrawal individually to every person who may have seen the offer, the rule is that a withdrawal published in the same way that the offer was originally made will be effective.
/->-Where an offer is not limited in duration, the rule is that it lapses after the expiration of a reasonable time.




NAME Ramsgate Victoria Hotel v Montefiore
CITATION Ramsgate Victoria Hotel v Montefiore (1866) LR 1 Ex 109
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal of Offer (and Lapse)
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The defendant applied for shares in the plaintiff company on 8 June 1864 (the offer). He heard nothing more until 23 November 1864, when the company sent him a letter asking him to pay for the shares (this letter was putatively the acceptance). The defendant no longer wanted the shares, and argued that his offer had lapsed before acceptance was made. A very briefly reported judgment affirmed that he was correct.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look *~
/->-_It may be of interest to see the way in which a later judge examines the underlying rationale for this rule. The rule itself is uncontroversial, and it may well be that little will turn on what ground it is put, but the following passage from Buckley J's judgment in Manchester Diocesan Council for Education v Commercial and General Investments (1970) gives some insight into the values which inform a mid-twentieth century consideration of contract formation: “There appear to me to be two possible views on methods of approaching the problem. First, it may be said that by implication the offer is made on terms that, if it is not accepted within a reasonable time, it must be treated as withdrawn. Alternatively, it may be said that, if the offeree does not accept the offer within a reasonable time, he must be treated as having refused it. On either view the offer would cease to be a live one on the expiration of what in the circumstances of the particular case should be regarded as a reasonable time for acceptance. The first of these alternatives involves implying a term that if the offer is not accepted within a reasonable time, it shall be treated as withdrawn or lapsing at the end of that period if it has not then been accepted; the second is based on an inference to be drawn from the conduct of the offeree, that is, that having failed to accept the offer within a reasonable time he has manifested an intention to refuse it. If, in the first alternative, the time which the offeror is to be treated as having set for acceptance is to be such a time as is reasonable at the date of the offer, what is reasonable must depend on circumstances then existing and reasonably likely to arise during the continuance of the offer; but it would not be unlikely that the offeror and offeree would make different assessments of what would be reasonable even if, as might quite possibly not be the case, they based those judgments on identical known and anticipated circumstances. No doubt a court could resolve any dispute about this, but this approach clearly involves a certain degree of uncertainty about the precise terms of the offer. […] The second alternative on the other hand involves simply an objective assessment of facts and the determination of the question whether on the facts the offeree should in fairness to both parties be regarded as having refused the offer._
/->-_It does not seem to me that either party is in greater need of protection by the law in this respect than the other. Until his offer has been accepted it is open to the offeror at any time to withdraw it or to put a limit on the time for acceptance. On the other hand, the offeree can at any time refuse the offer, or, unless he has been guilty of unreasonable delay, accept it. Neither party is at a disadvantage. Unless authority constrains me to do otherwise, I am strongly disposed to prefer the second alternative to the first”._




NAME Williams v Carwardine
CITATION Williams v Carwardine (1833) 5 C & P 566
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; Knowledge of Offer
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-A reward having been offered for information leading to the discovery of a murderer, the plaintiff gave the relevant information. She had been attacked and severely beaten by the individual in question, and believing she did not have long to live, she gave the information in order to ease her conscience. The jury found that her motive in giving it had not been the offer of a reward, but the judge at first instance nevertheless directed a verdict in her favour. Held, as far as one can tell from the report, that a panel of appeal judges decided the plaintiff's knowledge of the offer was to be deduced from the circumstances, and that her motivation in responding to it was irrelevant.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_You may like to take a look at the extract from the report as it is given in Smith & Thomas's casebook. It consists of an exchange between the judges hearing the appeal, with a one-line contribution from counsel for the defendant (looking like an own goal, or a very candid concession, depending on one's view). There are several points of minor interest in it. One is that not all the judges are correct in what they say. Another is that the judge who heard the case at first instance is sitting on the appeal from his own decision. This was by no means unusual at the time._
/->-_The case, such as it is, gives an insight into the state of the reported law from which the principles of contract were to be extracted, largely in the course of the nineteenth century. One might almost conclude that at this fairly early date, the issue at stake in this exchange is being judicially treated as if it were a problem of evidence – specifically, a problem of relevance or irrelevance. Principle must underlie what the judges are doing, but it still appears more as judicial know-how rather than the deployment of rules of general application._
/->-_The next case, decided 30 years later, provides an interesting comparison. There is no shortage of principle, but its application leads to dissent._




NAME Tinn v Hoffman & Co
CITATION Tinn v Hoffman & Co (1873) 29 LT 271
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; Knowledge of Offer
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The parties corresponded by post about the sale and purchase of 800 tons of iron. One offered to sell for 69 shillings a ton. Before that letter arrived, the other wrote offering to buy at the same price. In fact the second letter was interpreted by the majority of the court as a counter offer, because it also referred to obtaining more iron at a lower price, but the problem of identical offers crossing in the post was dealt with, obiter, by the majority. They decided that such cross-offers did not form a contract. A further communication would be needed by way of response to one of the two offers.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Blackburn J, in the majority, explained his view of the situation as follows: “When a contract is made between two parties there is a promise by one in consideration of the promise made by the other; there are two assenting minds, the parties agreeing in opinion, and one having promised in consideration of the promise of the other – there is an exchange of promises; but I do not think exchanging offers would, upon principle, be at all the same thing…. The promise or offer being made on each side in ignorance of the promise or offer made on the other side neither of them can be construed as an acceptance of the other. Either of the parties may write and say “I accept your offer, and, as you perceive, I have already made a similar offer to you,” and then people would know what they were about…”.
/->-Honyman J, dissenting on this issue, said this: “I cannot see why the fact of the letters crossing each other should not make a good contract. If I say I am willing to buy a man's house on certain terms and he at the same moment says he is willing to sell it, and these two letters are posted so that they are irrevocable with respect to the writers, why should that not constitute a good contract? The parties are <i>ad idem</i> at one and the same moment”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_Blackburn J's opinion, requiring the exchange of promises, is strongly reliant on the principle of consideration or bargain. This is not surprising, since the account of contracts as bargains enjoyed its greatest prestige at this time. However, it is not altogether obvious why agreement must necessarily take the form of bargain; agreement is a fact, however it comes about. Grove J goes even further, requiring there to have been an opportunity for “consideration” by which he clearly means “reflection”, before an offer can be accepted. This is certainly not what “consideration” usually means in a contractual context. One is left with the impression that the emerging “principles” of contract law have not yet acquired wholly stable meanings at the time of this case. Nowadays, one would simply analyse the situation in Tinn v *Hoffman* in terms of the need for communication, and the need for reasonable certainty. _
/->-_Honyman J, dissenting, applies a well-recognised principle, but again arguably allows it to take inappropriate control of the analysis. In his view if the parties are <b>ad idem</b> that is all that is necessary; there must therefore be a contract. We have already seen that being <b>ad idem</b> works best as an ideal in contract law, explaining for instance why the courts attribute legal consequences to agreements. It words less well as an analytic tool. Here, it leads Honyman J to find the parties bound to each other when neither yet knows of it. That is not a sensible result._
/->-_In the next case, it is confirmed that knowledge of an offer is required before it can be validly accepted._

NAME R v Clarke
CITATION R v Clarke (1927) 40 CLR 227
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; Knowledge of Offer
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The Government of Western Australia offered a reward for information leading to the arrest of suspected murderers, and a pardon to an accomplice who gave the information. Clarke did give the information, but later admitted that his only reason for doing so had been to clear himself of a charge of murder. He later sued the Crown for the reward, although he conceded that he had not had the reward in mind at the time he came forward with the information.
/->-Held that he had not validly accepted the offer of the reward. He had been unaware of the existence of the offer; to have forgotten about it was the same as never knowing of it.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-This seems to be a clear case, but some commentators do not regard it as such. Bishop, Beale and Furmston (<i>Contract Cases and Materials</i>) conclude that “it is not necessary that the offer is the main motivation for the offeree acting, provided he or she is aware of the offer”. However<i>, R v Clarke</i> and <i>Williams v Carwardine</i> decide that motivation is irrelevant, as long as there is factual awareness of the offer. *McKendrick*, quoting <i>Chitty on Contracts</i> (ed. Beale), states that: “ an act which is wholly motivated by factors other than the existence of the offer cannot amount to an acceptance; but if the existence of the offer plays some part, however small, in inducing a person to do the required act, there is a valid acceptance of the offer”. Apart from the fact that it is unattractive to have to distinguish between the absence of a motive and its presence to a vanishingly small extent, <i>R v Clarke</i> does not support Chitty's view. Motive is irrelevant, providing there is knowledge of the offer.
/->-An overview of the nature of unilateral contracts has already been given. Now the subject must be revisited in somewhat greater detail, because the location of the moment of acceptance in these arrangements has proved problematic.
/->-The offer of a unilateral contract is a promise to pay money, or to confer some other benefit, provided the offeree behaves in a certain way. The required behaviour amounts to the performance of a <i>condition</i>. The offeror is not obliged to honour his promise until the condition is fully performed – this is uncontroversial. The difficulty consists in deciding at what moment the offer of the unilateral contract is accepted, and therefore, until what point the offeror remains free to withdraw the offer. On a strict view, which receives some support from the decided cases, acceptance only takes place when the condition is fully performed. More recent authority suggests that there is acceptance as soon as the offeree embarks on performance of the condition.
/->-The problem with the strict view is traditionally expressed in the “walk to York” example. The offeror promises the offeree a sum of money if the offeree will walk to York. May the offeror really take advantage of the rules of contract formation to act on a change of mind and withdraw that offer as the offeree approaches York? If acceptance requires arrival at York, the answer seems to be yes.

NAME Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd v Cooper
CITATION Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd v Cooper [1941] AC 108
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; Acceptance In Unilateral Contracts
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The appellants owned two cinemas, which they wished to sell. They arranged with the respondent that if he introduced a purchaser who did indeed go on to purchase the cinemas, they would pay him £10,000 commission. The respondent did introduce a willing purchaser, but the appellants disposed of the cinemas to another party. The respondent claimed the commission, or alternatively damages, arguing that a term should be implied into the contract that the appellants would “do nothing to prevent the satisfactory completion of the transaction so as to deprive the respondent of the agreed commission”. The House of Lords found for the appellants, denying that commission was payable unless the respondent's client bought the cinemas, and rejecting the proposed implied term.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-This case can be taken as deciding that (at least on its own facts) there was no acceptance of the offer of a unilateral contract until the condition were fully performed, so that until that time the offeror could withdraw the offer or render its acceptance impossible. However, the reasoning in the case is not predominantly along those lines. It largely turns on whether the implied term contended for by the respondent can properly be introduced into the contract. To understand the House of Lords' decision that it cannot, it is essential to realise that the test for the implying of a term into a contract is <i>necessity</i>. If it is not possible to discharge the heavy burden of demonstrating that the implication of a term is necessary, it will not be implied even though it might be thought a reasonable or attractive improvement to the contract.
/->-It is in this light that the following passage from the speech of Lord Russell of Killowen should be read: “I can find no safe ground on which to base the introduction of any such implied term. Implied terms, as we all know, can only be justified under the compulsion of some necessity. No such compulsion or necessity exists in the case under consideration. The agent is promised a commission if he introduces a purchaser at a specified or minimum price. The owner is desirous of selling. The chances are largely in favour of the deal going through, if a purchaser is introduced. […] A sum of £10,000 (the equivalent of the remuneration of a year's work by a Lord Chancellor) for work done within a period of eight or nine days is no mean reward, and is one well worth a risk. There is no lack of business efficacy in such a contract <i>[read “arrangement”]</i>, even though the principal is free to refuse to sell to the agent's client”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_Lord Russell also deals with the contention that there ought to be a claim in quasi contract/restitution on a <b>quantum meruit</b> (“how much the claimant deserved to be paid”) if the offeror fails to allow the sale to go through. A <b>quantum meruit</b> action is not available here, because the offer of the unilateral contract itself fully specifies the condition on which commission will be payable, and cannot be circumvented merely because the condition has not been fulfilled._




NAME Errington v Errington and Woods
CITATION Errington v Errington and Woods [1952] 1 KB 290
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; Acceptance In Unilateral Contracts
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-A father bought a house for his son and daughter-in-law to live in, and promised them that he would transfer it into their names if they paid off the mortgage on it. They began to pay the mortgage in instalments, but before it was fully paid off, the father died and his widow brought an action for possession of the house against the daughter-in-law. The action failed; the offer to transfer the house was an offer of a unilateral contract which was accepted by the couple as soon as they began to pay off the mortgage. The father (later, his estate) would not be bound to transfer the house until the condition of paying off the mortgage had been fully performed, but once performance of that condition had already begun it was too late for the offer to be withdrawn.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-This outcome does not follow because of some peculiarity in the law of real property (and in fact the nature of the couple's interest in the land pending complete payment of the mortgage is none too easy to classify in terms of land law). It simply turns upon *Denning LJ*'s view of when acceptance occurs on the unilateral contract model in these circumstances. A competent account of how the case is to be distinguished from <i>Luxor</i> should begin by broadly characterising what is happening in the two situations respectively – with a view to emphasising the distinctions between them.
/->-A position of general principle is taken up in the next case, and if one wants a resolution to the problem of acceptance in unilateral contracts, it should probably be taken from here.

NAME Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees Ltd
CITATION Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees Ltd [1978] Ch 231
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; Acceptance In Unilateral Contracts
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The plaintiffs alleged they had been promised that if they attended the defendants' offices at a given time with a deposit and their part of a contract for the sale of land duly signed, the defendants would sell them a portfolio of properties. They attended on time with the required documents, but the defendants refused to exchange contracts, asserted that exchange was part of the condition of the contract, and thus argued that they had validly withdrawn their offer before completion of its condition. Held that there was complete performance of the stated condition, so that the attempted withdrawal came too late. However, if that were wrong, the defendants were at any event not free to prevent fulfilment of the condition. There was an implied, subsidiary promise that once performance of the condition had begun, its completion would not be prevented. This implied promise was accepted by embarking on performance.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-The primary resolution of the issue at stake, and the further point of principle, are explained by Goff LJ: “The concept of a unilateral or “if” contract is somewhat anomalous, because it is clear that, at all events, until the offeree starts to perform the condition, there is no contract at all, but merely an offer which the offeror is free to revoke. Doubts have been expressed whether the offeror becomes bound so soon as the offeree starts to perform or satisfy the condition, or only when he has fully done so. In my judgment, however, we are not concerned in this case with any such problem, because in my view the plaintiffs had fully performed or satisfied the condition when they presented themselves with a banker's draft for the deposit and their part of the written contract for sale duly engrossed and signed, and there tendered the same, which I understand to mean proffered it for exchange. Actual exchange, which never took place, would not in my view have been part of the satisfaction of the condition but something additional which was inherently necessary to be done by the plaintiffs to enable, not to bind, the defendants to perform the unilateral contract.
/->-Even if my reasoning so far be wrong the conclusion in my view is still the same for the following reasons. Whilst I think that the true view of a unilateral contract must in general be that the offeror is entitled to require full performance of the condition which he has imposed and short of that he is not bound, that must be subject to an important qualification, which stems from the fact that there must be an implied obligation on the part of the offeror not to prevent the condition becoming satisfied, which obligation it seems to me must arise as soon as the offeree starts to perform. Until then the offeror can revoke the whole thing, but once the offeree has embarked on performance it is too late for the offeror to revoke his offer.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look *~
/->-_Must there be such an implied obligation? There are hints in earlier cases that Goff LJ is not alone in thinking that there must. In Offord v Davies (1962), Erle CJ said of the offer of a unilateral contract that “This promise by itself creates no obligation. It is in effect conditioned to be binding if the plaintiff acts upon it, either to the benefit of the defendants, or to the detriment of himself. But, <b>until the condition has been at least in part fulfilled</b>, the defendants have the power of revoking it”. There is further discussion in that case tending the same way. In Shuey v United States (above), Strong J said of another offer of a unilateral contract: “It is not to be doubted that the offer was revocable at any time before it was accepted, <b>and before anything had been done in reliance upon it</b>”. Goff LJ's device certainly works from the technical point of view. It is a similar mechanism to the one by which *Bingham MR* gave binding effect to the arrangement for dealing with tenders in Blackpool & Fylde (Lecture 2)._
/->-_On the other hand, can Goff LJ's principle stand with the decision of the House of Lords in Luxor v Cooper, where the need to imply such an obligation was considered and rejected? Even if it can, by virtually confining the earlier decision to its own facts, Daulia comes close to upsetting other authorities. Could it be used to generate a different outcome to the problem in Routledge v Grant (above)?_
/->-_Luxor v Cooper was not cited in Daulia. That may seem to weaken the case, particularly when taken in combination with the fact that Goff LJ's principle was in his own opinion unnecessary for the disposal of the case, and therefore obiter. However, Goff LJ is most unlikely to have been personally ignorant of House of Lords authority. The very fact that he chose to make a declaration of principle in Daulia when the case did not strictly require it adds urgency to his view. If a choice has to be made between the line taken in Luxor, and that of Daulia, (leaving to one side the vital matter of context), Daulia should probably be preferred. _
/->-_It is worth standing back to survey the walk to York once again. Professor Maurice Wormser, in “The True Conception of Unilateral Contracts” (26 Yale Law Journal 136) does just that, using the American equivalent of the Walk and the late withdrawal of the promise to remunerate it. He is still persuaded by the strict view:_
/->-_“The objection is made, however, that it is very “hard” upon B that he should have walked half-way across the Brooklyn Bridge and should get no compensation. This suggestion, invariably advanced, might be dismissed with the remark that “hard” cases should not make bad law. But going a step further, by way of reply, the pertinent inquiry at once suggests itself, “Was B bound to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge?” The answer to this is obvious. By hypothesis, B was not bound to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge…. If B was not bound to continue to cross the bridge, if B is will-free, why should not A also be will-free? Suppose that after B has crossed half the bridge he gets tired and tells A that he refuses to continue crossing. B, concededly, would be perfectly within his rights in so speaking and acting. A would have no cause of action against B for damages. If B has a <i>locus poenitentiae</i>, so has A…”._
