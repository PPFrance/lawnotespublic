NAME David Herling's Lectures
TYPE Help
YEAR 2016
CATEGORY David Herling's lectures in flashcard format, with links to Westlaw, etc.
SPECIAL ->-Flip over the current card by pressing *right*, flip back with *left*, or continue to the next with *right* again. On iPhones/iPads, *swiping* right or left should also work.<br><br>->-If a <span class="sansfont">Sans Serif Font</span> would be easier to read on your screen, uncheck *Garamond* in the options. If the wacky cards-in-a-pile thing gets up your nose, adjust the *messiness*, etc. Also, if the typeface on cards with lots of text gets just *too small to read*, select *larger minimum font* in the options.<br><br>->-*_Note well_* -- this set of cards was generated _automatically_ from the text of the sage Dr. H's texts, so _there may well be_ straggly/incomplete/missing items.
SUMMARY ~*Filter*~
/->-Enter *case names*, *categories*, *concepts*, or a *phrase text* (in quotes). These broaden out what's displayed, i.e., they combine disjunctively, with *or*, rather than *and*. That needs no further explanation as _it's 2016_ and _you're used to westlaw_, etc. You can also enter names of *tags*, *courts*, and *card type* (case, principle, statute, etc). These *restrict* the cards displayed. If the thing you're searching for doesn't appear in the list of suggestions, it'll be searched for as a phrase in the body of the cards. 
SUMMARY ~*Options & Config*~
/->-The button with three lines (top left corner) reveals a panel with options for display, etc. It remembers where you were, so when you can close the browser and reopen it a day later, you'll be back at the same place, with the same selection. (If something fucks egregiously up, there's a very discreet link marked *reset everything* on the bottom left.)
SUMMARY ~*Use on iPhones/iPads*~
/->-Pro tip: a much more biddable experience is to be had by pressing *share* at the bottom of the browser window, then *add to home screen*.
SUMMARY ~*Tags*~
/->-Drag tags onto cards from the panel on the right. Make up your own tags. Drag them away from the card to 'detag.' 
SUMMARY ~*Westlaw Cases*~
/->-Each case should appear (approximately) twice. Firstly the summary from my notes; secondly, if it could be found, the abstract/summary directly from Westlaw. Obviously everything pertaining to a case with _(Westlaw)_ in the title is of their copyright.
SUMMARY ~*Links*~
/->-A link to another cards will bring it to the front, but it fades out unless you click/press it to keep it in place. *Case cards* should have *On Westlaw* link in the top right or bottom left. This should bring up the judgment on westlaw, if you have a session open. Other links may appear when appropriate, or when my level of botherment about it was inexplicably non-trivial.
SUMMARY ~*Notes*~
/->-_*Note well*_ -- this was chucked together _in a hurry_ so def. has bugs, glitches, half-rephrased sentences in the cards, etc. And it's meant for the *latest version of Safari or Chrome* on *Mac*. What, you're a law student and you don't have a Mac?
/->-_*Also note that*_ -- the actual _cards_ in this set have been _automatically_ generated directly from the text of Herling's lectures, and I _absolutely_ am not going to check each one. There may be stray bits of markup, missingness/incompleteness. Don't _rely_ on this.
