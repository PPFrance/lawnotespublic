NAME Towards Promissory Estoppel - Introduction
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel
SUMMARY ~*Introduction*~
/->-This is the second of two lectures on the doctrine of consideration. It begins by examining the third of three pre-existing duty situations – the problem of regarding as consideration the performance of an existing contractual duty owed directly to the promisor (the first two duty situations were covered in the last lecture). The second part of the lecture is an exploration of equity's solution to this difficulty – the doctrine of promissory estoppel which accords limited effect to promises which are not supported by consideration.
/->-Parts of the lecture, unavoidably, are complex. There are various reasons for this, and they deserve to be recognised from the outset. The first is that the law in this area has developed in an extremely narrow space, confined by the decisions in <i>Stilk v Myrick</i> and <i>Foakes v Beer</i> (approving the rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i>). The mapping of this space and the decisions reached within it requires care. The second reason for complexity is that a large part of the modern law in this area arises from the relationship between common law and equity. Thirdly, a fault line runs through the whole area of part payment of debt; principles derived from debt and from assumpsit (contract) as a means of relinquishing a debt strain against each other.
/->-Discussion of this lecture's topics is therefore quite demanding, but application of the principles to the facts of problem questions need not be. A fairly basic grasp of what the main authorities decide will tend to lead to plausible answers. 




NAME Stilk v Myrick
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations to Promisor as Consideration
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-In the course of a voyage to the Baltic two sailors deserted. The captain attempted to recruit replacements, but failed to do so. He then promised the remainder of the crew that he would divide the wages of the two deserters between them in return for their promise to work the ship home short-handed. Upon the ship's return the claim for the extra wages was not honoured. The question was whether the sailors had given consideration for the captain's promise of the extra wages, given that they were already contractually bound to serve for the duration of the voyage. It was held that they had not. 
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-This was one of a number of cases arising out of similar situations. In an earlier one, <i>Harris v Watson</i> (1791), the claim for extra wages failed on public policy grounds because the court was unwilling to create a precedent that might tempt sailors to extort promises of further payment from masters by duress. There are two reports of <i>Stilk v Myrick</i>. In that of the notoriously unreliable law reporter Espinasse, Lord Ellenborough is said to have approved the policy basis of the earlier decision. In the other (Campbell's report), Lord Ellenborough is quoted as expressly distancing himself from reasoning based on duress. The agreement to pay extra was unenforceable simply because the sailors had done no more than they were already bound to do: “They had sold all their services till the voyage should be completed. If they had been at liberty to quit the vessel at Cronstadt, the case would have been quite different; or if the captain had capriciously discharged the two men who were wanting, the others might not have been compellable to take the whole duty upon themselves, and their agreeing to do so might have been a sufficient consideration for the promise of an advance of wages. But the desertion of a part of the crew is to be considered an emergency of the voyage as much as their death, and those who remain are bound by the terms of their original contract to exert themselves to the utmost to bring the ship in safety to her destined port”. 
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-<i>Stilk v Myrick</i>, despite its age, sets the scene for continuing debate within this area of law. If a promise made in return for the performance of existing duties is not to be upheld, which of the two competing rationales (duress and lack of consideration) best explains why that is? To reject such arrangements for duress is not the most transparent way of dealing with them. There was no duress on the facts in <i>Stilk v Myrick</i>, so in reality the objection is based merely on fear of future duress. Such a policy-based concern is not self-evidently an improper ground for decision, but it may be preferable to judge cases on their own facts, reserving the right to reject a claim for duress where in fact it can be shown to have been applied. As for the alternative of finding no consideration in these circumstances, it should by now be apparent that this really amounts to stating an outcome rather than showing why it is a correct or necessary outcome. There is no sufficient reason to uphold the deal – but why not? Must the theory of bargain dictate the same conclusion in every case in which more is offered in return for the performance of an existing duty? Another way forward would be to acknowledge that claims of this sort may sometimes not be worthy of support, but that sometimes they <i>will</i> be based on promises which have been made for good reason. As <i>Williams v Roffey</i> shows (below), this is the way that English law has tentatively gone, but it is a controversial development. 




NAME Hartley v Ponsonby
CITATION Hartley v Ponsonby (1857) 7 E&B 872
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations to Promisor as Consideration
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-A crew of 36 was engaged for a voyage from Liverpool to Australia. When the ship reached Australia, 17 of the men were imprisoned for refusing to work. The ship's master, who had failed to find replacements at a reasonable price, promised some of the remaining men extra money to take the ship as far as Bombay “with a crew of 19 hands”. The extra money was not paid. It was held that the promise to pay it was enforceable. The passage to Bombay was so short-handed as to be dangerous, and therefore it was unreasonable to expect the remaining men to undertake it as part of their original contractual duties. The deal done in Australia amounted to a new contract.




NAME Williams v Carwardine
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The defendants were contractors refurbishing a block of flats, and the plaintiffs were sub-contracted to them to carry out carpentry work. The plaintiffs ran into financial difficulties while working for the defendants, partly because the parties had agreed an unusually low price for the work, and partly because the plaintiffs failed to supervise their workers properly. The defendants would be liable to penalties if the work were not done on time. They therefore agreed to pay more money in return for the plaintiffs finishing their work by the contractual deadline. The defendants failed to pay, and argued that the plaintiffs had given no consideration for the promise to pay more, since they were to do nothing other than what they were already bound by contract to do anyway. The Court of Appeal held that the promise to pay more was enforceable. The principle of <i>Stilk v Myrick</i> remained good law, so that a gratuitous promise was not enforceable (unless made in a deed). Where, however, the promise conferred a practical advantage on the promisor, the court would find that it was supported by consideration. Here the defendants benefited from their promise in that they avoided liability to a penalty for late completion. They also obtained a more formalised relationship with the plaintiffs, and therefore more control over their work.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-(i) If A has entered into a contract with B to do work for, or to supply goods or services to B in return for payment by B, and
/->-(ii) at some stage before A has completely performed his obligations under the contract B has reason to doubt whether A will, or will be able to, complete his side of the bargain, and
/->-(iii) B thereupon promises A an additional payment in return for A's promise to perform his contractual obligations on time and
/->-(iv) as a result of giving his promise B obtains in practice a benefit, or obviates a disbenefit, and
/->-(v) B's promise is not given as a result of economic duress or fraud on the part of A, then
/->-(vi) the benefit to B is capable of being consideration for B's promise, so that the promise will be legally binding.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-Williams v Roffey</i> is a controversial case because it allows a promisee to enforce a promise even though he is doing nothing more in return for it than he was already obliged to do. Whether this is a proper legal development must depend on the view one takes of what consideration is, and the role that it plays or ought to play in the law. 
/->-If consideration is a body of technical rules, this case appears to breach them. This is the view of Professor Coote, who argues that the case purports to abolish the need for consideration to support the variation of contracts. If, as Russell LJ says in <i>Williams v Roffey</i>, the assessment of consideration should reflect the parties' intentions, then there is certainly consideration on these facts – but the doctrine now seems virtually to have merged with the parallel analysis of intention to create legal relations (the subject of the next lecture). 
/->-In the first condition of his six-part statement of principle in <i>Williams v Roffey</i>, Glidewell LJ carefully limits its application to cases in which the promisee has undertaken to do work for, or to supply good or services to the promisor. The ratio of the case therefore does not cover an undertaking to pay money to the promisor. An attempt to extend <i>Williams v Roffey</i> to cases involving obligations of debt was made and rejected in <i>Re Selectmove</i> (already cited in an earlier lecture, on the issue of acceptance by silence). Part payment of debt is governed by the House of Lords' decision in <i>Foakes v Beer</i>, and that prevents extension of the reasoning in <i>Williams v Roffey</i> into this area. <i>Foakes v Beer</i> will be examined in its own right very shortly. 




NAME Re Selectmove Ltd
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Here the question was whether there was a binding contract between a company and the Inland Revenue that the Revenue would not seek to put the company into liquidation. The company argued that it had given consideration for this alleged agreement by agreeing to pay its debt to the Revenue in instalments. In the Court of Appeal Peter Gibson LJ held that this could not be regarded as consideration for the alleged promise, since the company was doing no more than it was already obliged to do. “The difficulty that I feel with [the argument that <i>Williams v Roffey</i> should apply] is that if the principle of <i>Williams</i>' case is to be extended to an obligation to make payment, it would in effect leave the principle in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> without any application. Where a creditor and a debtor who are at arm's length reach agreement on the payment of the debt by instalments to accommodate the debtor, the creditor will no doubt always see a practical benefit to himself in so doing. In the absence of authority there would be much to be said for the enforceability of such a contract. But that was a matter expressly considered in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> yet held not to constitute good consideration in law. <i>Foakes v Beer</i> was not even referred to in <i>Williams'</i> case, and it is in my judgment impossible, consistently with the doctrine of precedent, for this court to extend the principle of <i>Williams</i>' case to any circumstances governed by the principle of <i>Foakes v Beer</i>. If that extension is to be made, it must be by the House of Lords or, perhaps even more appropriately, by Parliament after consideration by the Law Commission”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_The language used by Peter Gibson LJ deserves careful scrutiny. The ratio of the case is clear; Foakes v Beer is not to be undermined. However, this conclusion is reached without relish, and solely because of the doctrine of precedent and the necessity of deference to the House of Lords. _




NAME Part Payment of a Debt as Consideration
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations to Promisor as Consideration; Part Payment of a Debt as Consideration
SUMMARY ~*Part Payment of a Debt as Consideration*~
/->-The cases examined so far, as remarked above, concern original promises to perform services pursuant to contract, in return for which further payment is later promised. The focus now shifts to the situation in which the original undertaking is to pay a sum of money, in other words a debt. This is not merely a repeat of the previous type of arrangement this time with different facts. In the debt cases, the debtor is not fulfilling the original obligation in return for the creditor promising something extra – these are simply not the facts. Instead, the debtor is proposing to make part payment of what is owed in return for the creditor receiving such performance in full satisfaction of the whole debt. The difference is sometimes described as being between an increasing pact (the service cases) and a decreasing pact (the debt cases). Nevertheless, the nub of the problem, as before, consists in whether a new agreement can be considered contractually binding even though it is not supported by consideration in the conventional sense. It might be thought that there would be much to be said for a single solution to both types of case. After all, they do not appear logically to be that different.
/->-The mechanics of the debt cases need to be explained. To pay a debt is a duty, and upon payment the debt is discharged. However, even if payment is not made to discharge the debt, the parties may enter into a contract to terminate the duty otherwise than by payment in full. This contract consists of agreement (here referred to as “accord”), and consideration moving from the debtor (here called “satisfaction”). 
/->-The basic proposition within this area is that part payment is not of itself capable of being satisfaction, even if the accord makes it quite clear that the creditor receives it as such. This is referred to as the rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i>.




NAME Pinnel's Case
CITATION Pinnel's Case (1602) 5 Rep 117a
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations to Promisor as Consideration; Part Payment of a Debt as Consideration
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The defendant pleaded that he had tendered part payment of a debt before the due date and the creditor had received it as satisfaction for the whole. It was held that his defence failed, since he should additionally have pleaded that he tendered it in full satisfaction. Had he done so, it would have been good satisfaction for the whole debt because of the early payment. Coke CJ said, obiter: “that payment of a lesser sum on the day in satisfaction of a greater cannot be any satisfaction for the whole, because it appears to the judges that by no possibility a lesser sum can be satisfaction to the plaintiff for a greater sum: but the gift of a horse, hawk or robe etc., in satisfaction is good for it shall be intended that a horse, hawk or robe etc, might be more beneficial to the plaintiff than the money, in respect of some circumstances, or otherwise the plaintiff would not have accepted it in satisfaction”.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-This remarkable case needs more than a little explanation. It is of relevance only for the obiter statement above which was entirely unnecessary to the decision but has steered English law within this area for four centuries. 
/->-The words “it appears to the judges” indicate a conclusion which is based not upon evidence but upon the judges' common experience; the idea is akin to the principle of “judicial notice” being taken of a fact which has not been subject to formal proof. “It shall be intended” is the seventeenth century legal English term for an irrebuttable presumption of law. The presumption in question arises when the creditor requests (the need for a request is stated later by Coke CJ) and accepts a “horse, hawk or robe etc” in full satisfaction for a debt on the due date, either in addition to part payment or instead of any payment at all. A “horse, hawk or robe etc” seems to be a way of referring to anything whatsoever that the debtor was not bound by the original agreement to provide. The reason this works as satisfaction is because of the irrebuttable legal presumption of the possibility of benefit to the creditor, and because of the standard proposition that the law will not judge the adequacy of consideration.
/->-Pinnel's Case</i> also makes it clear that part payment requested and accepted before the due day will function in the same way as a “horse, hawk or robe etc”. The court will presume from its acceptability to the creditor it that could have been more beneficial than a later payment in full.
/->-The “Rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i>” is not difficult to understand, but it is intellectually troubling. Why should the law take a point on the inadequacy of part payment, when the general rule is that consideration need not be adequate? And how can the law maintain the fiction that any thing will do as substituted performance, when its inadequacy may be quite as obvious as that of part payment?
/->-If one asks why part payment on the day cannot function like a horse, hawk, robe, peppercorn or chocolate wrapper, the answer normally given is that the creditor is receiving nothing new or additional by way of consideration for his promise to set aside the debt. Another reason, which perhaps goes further into the minds of the judges at the time of <i>Pinnel's Case</i>, is a little more nuanced. The provision of some new thing suggests the making of a new agreement to terminate the original debt. The making of part payment suggests nothing more than a payment on account towards the discharge of the debt. It will readily be seen why the judges are ready to value that part payment to find it wanting, and thereby seem to ignore the rule that consideration need not be adequate. They do not assess it as consideration at all, but as an attempt to discharge a duty. It appears to them, correctly, that a duty is either discharged or not discharged. 
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_A somewhat different answer now follows – you may well not want to spend time on it. Pinnel's Case concerned a penal bond with conditional defeasance. This type of arrangement, extremely common at the time, amounted to an agreement that one party would be subject (in debt) to a draconian penalty subject only to the condition that if they did something else first (the envisaged performance), they would be entitled not to pay the penalty. The envisaged performance could consist in conduct, or in the payment of a sum of money, much less than the penalty. Pinnel's Case was of course an arrangement of the latter type, envisaging payment._
/->-_Under the penal bond with conditional defeasance, the sum which is envisaged to be paid is not a debt, and therefore a case like Pinnel is not actually about the part payment of debt. The sum envisaged to be paid is a condition, and fulfilment of the condition will entitle the debtor not to pay the true debt owed under such a bond – the penal sum which is the technical subject of the agreement between the parties. Pinnel's Case therefore decides what can validly be imported as a replacement condition into the agreement, and not what will discharge a debt. This refinement of perspective is slight, but nevertheless helpful. Where one party requests and accepts a chattel instead of the envisaged payment, the court's conclusion will be that the condition must have been varied; a different thing is being done. Where, however, part payment is made on the day, nothing is being done to suggest that the original condition has been replaced by a different one. The part payment will be taken to be referable to the original condition. If one asks (with the early seventeenth century's liking for formalism) whether part payment amounts to performance of that condition or not, only one answer is possible. It is the answer given by Coke CJ. _
/->-_In 1884 the House of Lords had to decide whether part payment of a debt could be satisfaction for the full amount owing. The dictum in <i>Pinnel's Case</i> was upheld as good law._




NAME Foakes v Beer
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations to Promisor as Consideration; Part Payment of a Debt as Consideration
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-As a result of a court case brought to recover a debt, Dr Foakes owed Mrs Beer £2090 19s. He asked for time to pay. She agreed that if he made a down payment of £500 and then paid the remaining sum in instalments she would take no further action upon the judgment. Dr Foakes duly made all the stipulated repayments, but Mrs Beer then claimed that he was bound to pay interest on the debt as well. The House of Lords had to resolve two linked questions: (a) had Mrs Beer promised not to claim the interest, and if she had, (b) was her promise supported by consideration and therefore binding? Their Lordships differed as to whether Mrs Beer had promised not to claim interest, but all agreed that if she had, then her promise was not binding, because she had received nothing extra in return for that promise. The rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i> was approved, though without much enthusiasm.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-The issue on which <i>Foakes v Beer</i> seems to have turned was whether any benefit accrued or might accrue to the creditor through the acceptance of part payment of a debt on the due day. The sense in which the House considered this question is explained by the Earl of Selborne LC: 
/->-“What is called “any benefit, or even any legal possibility of benefit,” in Mr Smith's notes to <i>Cumber v Wane</i> [a case following <i>Pinnel's Case</i>] is not (as I conceive) that sort of benefit which a creditor might derive from getting payment of part of the money due to him from a debtor who might otherwise keep him at arm's length, or possibly become insolvent, but is some independent benefit, actual or contingent, of a kind which might in law be a good and valuable consideration for any other sort of agreement not under seal”. 
/->-The most noteworthy speech in the case is that of Lord Blackburn. He stated that he thought the rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i> to be wrong, because Lord Coke in that case was factually mistaken when he said that it could never be a benefit to the creditor to receive only part of what he was owed. On that basis, Lord Blackburn said that he had intended to dissent, and urge that <i>Pinnel's Case</i> be overruled, and had even written his speech, but had changed his mind:
/->-“What principally weighs with me in thinking that Lord Coke made a mistake of fact is my conviction that all men of business, whether merchants or tradesmen, do every day recognise and act on the ground that prompt payment of a part of their demand may be more beneficial to them than it would be to insist on their rights and enforce payment of the whole. Even where the debtor is perfectly solvent, and sure to pay at last, this is often so. Where the credit of the debtor is doubtful is must be more so. I had persuaded myself that there was no such long-continued action on this dictum [in <i>Pinnel's case</i>] as to render it improper in this House to re-consider the question. I had written my reasons for so thinking; but as they were not satisfactory to the other noble and learned Lords who heard the case, I do not now repeat them nor persist in them.
/->-I assent to the judgment proposed, though it is not that which I had originally thought proper”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_The following discussion raises three separate points. You do not need to linger over any of them unless you find them helpful._
/->-_1. It is possible to come away from Foakes v Beer regarding the decision as a paradox. What would have given binding force to Mrs Beer's promise not to require the interest? Nothing short of payment of the interest in full (or some substituted performance). The reason that Mrs Beer's promise didn't bind her is that Dr Foakes took her at her word. It can seem very odd that the doctrine of consideration leads to this result._
/->-_The best route away from the paradox is to recall the policy which lies behind the rule in Pinnel's case. The law does not readily presume that a creditor intends to forgo a debt, but is alive to the risk that an unscrupulous debtor may try to trick a creditor into doing just that. In *Treitel*'s view (Some Landmarks of Twentieth Century Contract Law) that is exactly what Dr Foakes' solicitor had tried to do here. The rule in Pinnel's case stops it happening. If the creditor genuinely wishes to release the part-paying debtor, the use of a deed will achieve the intended result._
/->-_2. The difference between the Earl of Selborne LC's view and the near-dissent of Lord Blackburn is a narrow one. The crucial concept in the former's discussion of the law is “some independent benefit”; Lord Blackburn, by contrast, had been sufficiently impressed by the real if not the independent benefit of a creditor's getting at least some payment that he would have found consideration in that. (In fact they are still closer, because the Earl of Selborne LC stated that he would have regarded the adoption of Lord Blackburn's preferred view as an improvement in the law, had he not thought the doctrine of precedent stood in the way of it). If the matter is to come down to the nature of the structural relation between an admitted benefit and the promise which it is to support, it is hard not to conclude that the analysis is too technical. Do the principles of consideration really require this, and if so, can their demand be justified? _
/->-_3. On a wholly unrelated point, you may wonder whether there was not another way in which Foakes v Beer could have been decided. Mrs Beer was (or may have been) content to take somewhat less than the full sum which she was owed by giving up the interest on the money due to her. Dr Foakes was willing to and did pay this agreed sum. Were the parties not compromising a claim? Not surprisingly, this does not work. The compromised claim cases involve disputed or unliquidated claims. Mrs Beer's claim was for a debt which was not subject to dispute; it was backed by a High Court judgment. _
/->-_h3>Two of the exceptions to the rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i> do not so much confine it as apply it, and are in fact both alluded to in Coke CJ's note of what the case decided. The first, already mentioned, is that part payment of a debt is good satisfaction for a promise to relinquish the whole provided it is requested and accepted in full satisfaction before the due date. These were the facts of <i>Pinnel's Case</i> itself, and would have given the defendant a good defence had it not been for the error of pleading on which the decision in fact turned. </h3_
/->-_h3>The second exception is where the part payment is requested and accepted in full satisfaction at a place other than the one originally fixed for payment. On the extraordinarily technical perspective of the early seventeenth century, either of these arrangements can be regarded not merely as payment on account towards the discharge of the full debt, but as satisfaction for an independent accord to relinquish the full debt.</h3_
/->-_h3>Payment at a different place seems, however, to count as substituted performance only if it is genuinely beneficial to the creditor, as the next case shows.</h3_
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The plaintiff, who was indebted to the defendants, had allegedly been promised that they would not serve a bankruptcy notice on him if he paid the debt on 7 July. On 6 July, the plaintiff informed the defendants that he could not pay on the following day, but that he could borrow the money in Eastbourne on 8 July. The plaintiffs asked him to pay it in at a bank in Eastbourne to the credit of their solicitor's account in London. The plaintiff did so, but his letter informing the defendants' solicitor of this was not delivered. The bankruptcy notice was therefore served on him. He sued for breach of the promise not to serve the notice. His action failed since it was held on appeal that the request to pay the money in Eastbourne had been a mere “voluntary indulgence” to the plaintiff from which the defendants derived no actual benefit. The agreement was unsupported by consideration.
/->-A third exception to the rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i> exists where the part payment is made to the creditor <b>by someone other than the debtor.</b

NAME Hirachand Punamchand v Temple
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations to Promisor as Consideration; Evasion of Rule In |Pinnel's Case|
SUMMARY ~*Hirachand Punamchand v Temple*~
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The defendant, Lieutenant Temple, had borrowed money from moneylenders (the plaintiffs) in India while serving there with the British Army. He had given a bond and a promissory note in return for the loan. He was unable to pay it back, and the plaintiffs wrote to his father, Sir Richard Temple. Sir Richard sent a banker's draft for a sum less than the full debt, making it clear that he intended it to be in full and final settlement. The plaintiffs wrote back saying that they required payment in full, and that they would cash the draft and hold the money on account. They then sued the defendant for the remainder of the debt. It was held that they must be deemed to have accepted the money on the terms on which it was offered, and thus in full and final settlement. Their right to the remainder had been extinguished.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-A number of reasons are given by the court to support this outcome. Some are far-fetched. Perhaps the most convincing – regardless of whether it is well supported by the facts of the case – is that the third party is concluding a new contract for the release of the debtor. On this view it at least cannot be said that the promisee (the third party) is doing no more than he was already bound to do, because he was not previously bound to do anything at all. There is therefore no reason to compare what is paid with what was originally owed. 
/->-The objection to this reasoning is that it merely provides a technical solution to a technically conceived problem of consideration that has little to do with the facts of the case. There was no agreement along the lines that the court's analysis supposes. The plaintiffs were not content to conclude a new contract for the discharge of the defendant by which they lost money, and surely supposed that by cashing the banker's draft they were merely doing what any other creditor would be entitled to do on receiving part payment of a debt. It is another flaw in the rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i> that it can be manipulated to do the precise opposite of what it should – that is, to protect the rights of a creditor and distinguish genuine accords from bogus ones.
/->-Another exception to the rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i> is now defunct. It was formally held that the making of part payment <b>other than by cash</b> (for example by giving a negotiable instrument such as a cheque) amounted to substituted performance. In <i>D & C Builders Ltd v Rees</i> (1965) the Court of Appeal held that the authorities on which this rule was based would be either distinguished or overruled for the reason that the distinction had come to appear wholly fictitious (and incidentally would have produced an unjust result in the instant case). The decision is discussed further in a different context below. 
/->-The question whether one may retract a concession has fortunately not been altogether left in the sclerotic grip of <i>Pinnel's Case</i>. In another line of cases, decided in the courts' equitable jurisdiction, a far more reasonable approach is adopted; should the promisor in fairness be allowed to retract a concession on which the promisee has relied? This approach does not exactly contradict the common law's insistence that consideration must be found before the promisor will be contractually bound by his promise. Instead, it gives such limited effect to the promise as is necessary to avoid inequity.




NAME Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co
CITATION Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co (1877) 2 App Cas 439
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations to Promisor as Consideration; Equity's Evasion of Pinnel's Case
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The tenants of certain houses were given notice by their landlord in October 1874 to carry out repairs to the property within six months. The penalty for non-compliance was forfeiture of the lease. The tenants agreed to do the repairs, but suggested that the landlord might wish to buy the remaining term of the lease from them. They made it clear that the repairs would be deferred pending negotiations. Negotiations duly took place but were unsuccessful, and the landlord brought proceedings for possession at the expiry of six months from service of the original notice to repair. The House of Lords held that the six month period for repairs to take place did not run while negotiations were ongoing, but only from the point at which they had broken down. On that view the tenants had in fact completed the repairs within the period allowed, and were protected from forfeiture.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Lord Cairns LC made the following statement: “It is the first principle upon which all courts of equity proceed, that if parties who have entered into definite and distinct terms involving certain legal results – certain penalties or legal forfeiture – afterwards by their own act or with their own consent enter upon a course of negotiation which has the effect of leading one of the parties to suppose that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be enforced, or will be kept in suspense, or held in abeyance, the person who otherwise might have enforced those rights will not be allowed to enforce them where it would be inequitable having regard to the dealings which have thus taken place between the parties”. 
/->-The apparent limitations in Lord Cairns' statement of this principle above were doubted in the next case.

CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations to Promisor as Consideration; Equity's Evasion of Pinnel's Case
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Per Bowen LJ: “Now, it was suggested ...that that proposition only applied to cases where penal rights in the nature of forfeiture, or analogous to those of forfeiture, were sought to be enforced. I entirely fail to see any such possible distinction. The principle has nothing to do with forfeiture... It was applied in <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway</i> in a case in which equity could not relieve against forfeiture upon the mere ground that it was a forfeiture, but could interfere only because there had been something in the nature of acquiescence, or negotiations between the parties, which made it inequitable to allow the forfeiture to be enforced. The truth is that the proposition is wider than cases of forfeiture. It seems to me to amount to this, that if persons who have contractual rights against others induce by their conduct those against whom they have such rights to believe that such rights either will not be enforced or will be kept in suspense or abeyance for some particular time, those persons will not be allowed by a court of equity to enforce the rights until such time has elapsed, without at all events placing the parties in the same position as they were before. That is the principle to be applied. I will not say that it is not a principle that was recognised by courts of law as well as of equity. It is not necessary to consider how far it was always a principle of common law”. 
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-If one takes these two cases together, it will be seen that what is envisaged as triggering reliance is an “act” or “consent” or “conduct”. It is one party's behaviour, leading the other to infer that a contractual right will be suspended and to rely on that inference. As long as the doctrine amounts to no more than this, it is not obviously at odds with the common law, but can merely be understood as supplementing it, or – at most – mitigating the effects of the common law's limited respect for reliance. However, the next case, which is one of the most famous in English contract law, goes somewhat further. It proposes that certain promises, once relied upon, have legal effect despite the absence of consideration.

CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations to Promisor as Consideration; Equity's Evasion of Pinnel's Case
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-In 1937 the plaintiffs granted the defendants (who were their wholly owned subsidiary) the lease under seal of a block of flats in Clapham in return for payment of a ground rent. During the war years, it became difficult to let the flats because tenants feared for their safety. As a result the defendants were unable to pay the ground rent. The plaintiffs therefore promised that they would accept half the ground rent, and the defendants paid that reduced sum as it fell due from time to time. By 1945 the flats were fully let again, and a receiver who was now managing the plaintiffs' affairs brought the present action to establish what rent was owed to the plaintiffs. The claim was for the last two quarterly instalments of full ground rent which had fallen due after the flats were once again fully let. *Denning J* held that those sums were recoverable, since the concessionary reduction of the ground rent had been intended to last only as long as wartime conditions made it difficult for the defendants to pay the full ground rent. However, he said <i>obiter </i>that if the plaintiffs had sued for all the ground rent held back during the period, they would have been prevented from doing so by the rule in <i>Hughes</i>'s case. The principle was this: if a promise was made, which was intended to be relied upon, and was relied upon, then in equity the promisor would not be allowed to go back on the promise even though there were no consideration for it.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-“If I were to consider this matter without regard to recent developments in the law, there is no doubt that, had the plaintiffs claimed it, they would have been entitled to recover ground rent at the rate of £2,500 a year from the beginning of the term...
/->-But what is the position in view of developments in the law in recent years? ... There has been a series of decisions over the past 50 years which, although they are said to be cases of estoppel are not really such. They are cases in which a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made, and which was in fact so acted on. In such cases the courts have said that the promise must be honoured. The cases to which I desire to refer are: <i>Fenner v Blake</i> [1900] 1 QB 426; <i>Re Wickham</i> (1917) 34 TLR 158; <i>Re William Porter & Co Ltd</i> [1937] 2 All ER 361 and <i>Buttery v Pickard</i> [1946] WN 25. As I have said they are not really cases of estoppel in the strict sense. They are really promises – promises intended to be binding, intended to be acted on, and in fact acted on. <i>Jorden v Money</i> can be distinguished, because there the promisor made it clear that she did not intend to be legally bound, whereas in the cases to which I refer the proper inference was that the promisor did intend to be bound. In each case the court held the promise to be binding on the party making it, even though under the old common law it might be difficult to find any consideration for it. The courts have not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a promise, but they have refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it. It is in that sense, and that sense only, that such a promise gives rise to an estoppel. The decisions are a natural result of the fusion of law and equity: for the cases of <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co</i> (1877) 2 App Cas 439, 448; <i>Birmingham and District Land Co v London & North Western Railway Co</i> (1888) 40 Ch D 268, 286; and <i>Salisbury (Marquess) v Gilmore</i> [1942] 2 KB 38, 51 afford a sufficient basis for saying that a party would not be allowed in equity to go back on such a promise. In my opinion, the time has now come for the validity of such a promise to be recognised. The logical consequence, no doubt, is that a promise to accept a smaller sum in discharge of a larger sum, if acted upon, is binding notwithstanding the absence of consideration: and if the fusion of law and equity leads to this result, so much the better. That aspect was not considered in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> (1884) 9 App Cas 605. At this time of day, however, when law and equity have been joined together for over 70 years, principles must be reconsidered in the light of their combined effect....
/->-If the case had been one of estoppel, it might be said that in any event the estoppel would cease when the conditions to which the representation applied came to an end, or it also might be said that it would only come to an end upon notice. In either case it is only a way of ascertaining what is the scope of the representation. I prefer to apply the principle that a promise intended to be binding, intended to be acted on and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms properly apply. Here it was binding as covering the period down to the early part of 1945, and as from that time full rent is payable”.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-A great deal has been written about the obiter part of <i>High Trees</i> – without a doubt it is Lord Denning's most famous contract judgment. It requires study, preferably across a range of commentaries. It would be quite impossible here to give an academically exhaustive account, but it may be helpful to give a rough and ready checklist of the main issues.
/->-First, since Lord Denning's principle has become known as “promissory estoppel” (even though he initially seemed disinclined to adopt that label for it himself), it is appropriate to say what an estoppel is. Professor Birks explains that the word has its roots in the Norman French verb which denotes the stopping up of a container, such as a bottle, but he goes on to deduce from this the sense that “in short, one is bound”. This seems misleading. The core notion is not that somebody is bound, but that something is stopped up, and the thing that is stopped up is the mouth of a witness. Estoppel is essentially a rule of evidence which prevents a witness giving evidence which would be relevant if adduced, but which for reasons of fairness ought not to be adduced. Various estoppels are known to the law, and several labels are applied to them, but the key concept in all is that once the parties have conducted their business on a certain footing (eg. an assumption as to a particular fact), neither is permitted to deny that assumed fact even if it subsequently could be shown to be false. Justice here demands that consistency should prevail over truth. 
/->-Estoppel is known to the common law. One version of it appears in <i>Jorden v Money</i>, the case which Denning J carefully treads around in <i>High Trees</i>. That House of Lords case states that common law estoppel must be based on a statement of fact, not a promise. For a promise with regard to future conduct to give rise to any rights, it must of course be supported by consideration. Denning J acknowledges this, but finds two ways around the problem which it creates for him. The first is to distinguish <i>Jorden v Money</i> by reinterpreting it as a case in which there was no intention to create legal relations. The second is to avoid describing his own principle as an estoppel. The modern perspective simply consists in accepting that common law estoppel does require a statement of fact (a representation), but that there is also a second form of equitable or promissory estoppel which can be founded on a promise.
/->-Since Denning J found some difficulty in appropriating the term “estoppel” to his use, he relies on a variety of cases to which several labels have been applied; the taxonomy is not agreed, but the word “waiver” is most used in connection with them. <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway</i>, as extended by the <i>Birmingham</i> case, is the chief of them for Denning J's purposes, because it is a House of Lords authority, and because it derives the court's ability to intervene from its equitable jurisdiction. As a result of <i>Hughes</i>, a promise, even though unsupported by consideration, can be set up as a defence to an action for breach of contract. In <i>Foakes v Beer</i>, a promise unsupported by consideration was of no effect. Because <i>Hughes</i> is decided in equity, Denning J is able to explain <i>Foakes v Beer</i> as a decision in which the (then recent) fusion of law and equity was overlooked. 
/->-Plainly, Denning J would have decided <i>Foakes v Beer</i> differently. Nevertheless, his proposal that “a promise to accept a smaller sum in discharge of a larger sum … is binding” is mischievous. His own statement of the effect of promissory estoppel stops short of that. Such a promise is given limited effect as a defence if equity requires it.
/->-*Treitel* argues that the House of Lords in <i>Foakes v Beer</i> was not likely to have been unaware of <i>Hughes' Case</i>, since it had been decided only seven years earlier and involved two of the judges who also sat in <i>Foakes v Beer</i>. He suggests that the two authorities are not at variance because rights were merely suspended in <i>Hughes</i>, whereas Dr Foakes maintained that Mrs Beer's right to payment should be permanently extinguished. Much analysis of the cases in this area takes the distinction between suspension and extinction of rights to be fundamental, but in practice the distinction is not altogether clear-cut and needs to be regarded with a little caution. At first glance it does seem that the right of the landlord in <i>Hughes</i> to have the premises repaired was merely suspended. However, his right to the repairs within the original six months was permanently lost.
/->-Professor Smith makes a different distinction between <i>Hughes</i> and <i>Foakes v Beer</i>. He says that the result of <i>Hughes</i> (and of other cases on waiver) is that a claimant cannot sue for a breach of contract which has been induced by his own behaviour. <i>Foakes v Beer</i>, on the other hand, does not involve a breach of contract. The claim is for performance of a duty – the payment of a debt in full. The debt remains payable because of the rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i> even though the creditor has promised to forgo part of it. The express distinction, which is between induced non-performance and induced breach, hardly seems to work since the two will often amount to the same thing. The deeper distinction may be between obligated performance arising from debt, and promised performance arising from assumpsit (contract), but it is uncomfortably technical and this is not the place to pursue it.
/->-Where in all this does the obiter principle in <i>High Trees</i> stand? On a broad view (not a technical one), it can permanently prevent the recovery of money due, and it therefore goes beyond <i>Hughes</i>. The judgment, both in appearance and expression, seems to come into conflict with <i>Foakes v Beer</i> even though it does not flatly contradict it.
/->-Can Denning J's obiter doctrine stand? It is too firmly entrenched both here and in other common law jurisdictions to be overthrown. <i>Foakes v Beer</i> has been outflanked, and the two authorities co-exist in an uneasy tension. The factors which permit <i>High Trees</i> to maintain its position rather than simply falling before the decision of the superior court are these. First, it does not make a promise unsupported by consideration binding for all purposes. Such a promise is enforceable only as a defence, and not as a cause of action in its own right (which would still require it to be embodied in a contract and supported by consideration). Secondly, there must be some measure of reliance by the promisee on the promise. Thirdly, the promisor may be able to withdraw the promise by giving notice. Fourthly, the doctrine of <i>High Trees</i> is expressed to be derived from equity, and this allows it to claim the status of equity's answer to the common law problem of <i>Foakes v Beer</i>. These factors, in combination, allow the conclusion that promissory estoppel has a place of its own and is not simply an impermissible negation of <i>Foakes v Beer.

CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel
SUMMARY ~*Characteristics of Promissory Estoppel*~
/->-These and other aspects of promissory estoppel, and developments in them since <i>High Trees</i>, will now be examined separately. In fact a strictly systematic examination is difficult because the “ingredients” of promissory estoppel are closely interrelated and most of the cases therefore raise more than one of them.
/->-High Trees</i> itself makes it clear that the doctrine requires a distinct promise not to enforce full contractual rights, and the accompanying intention to affect the legal relations between the parties. 
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_However, this is a curiously complicated topic. Hughes and the Birmingham case say nothing at all about promises; the equitable doctrine in those decisions refers only to conduct, as already noted. One possible reason for that has already been suggested above in the discussion immediately before the citation of High Trees – the likely awareness of the judges in those cases that an estoppel could not be based on a promise because of Jorden v Money. Therefore it seems correct for largely historical reasons to say that a clear promise (express or implied ) is required to support Lord *Denning*'s doctrine, but that some less unequivocal form of behaviour, for example acquiescence, may be sufficient to support a waiver of rights. Adams and Brownsword (Key Issues in Contract), in a lengthy discussion of waiver, suggest its effect is to prevent exercise of a remedial option as though no such waiver had occurred. For present purposes the best conclusion may be that a waiver, which stops short of an express inducement of a breach of contract, could well have a more limited effect than a full-blown promissory estoppel._
/->-_The promise must have been relied on by the promisee before it will found an estoppel._

NAME Ajayi (EA) v Briscoe (Nigeria) Ltd
CITATION Ajayi (EA) v Briscoe (Nigeria) Ltd [1964] 3 All ER 556
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Characteristics of Promissory Estoppel; Reliance and Inequity
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The defendant had hired lorries from the plaintiff on hire purchase terms and was paying the purchase price in instalments. Some of the lorries were withdrawn from service because they needed repairs. The defendant asked the plaintiff to do the repairs, and said that this would be paid for once the lorries were back in service. The plaintiff replied that full hire purchase payments did not need to be made while the lorries were out of service, but later claimed full payment. The defendant argued that the plaintiff was estopped from claiming full payment because the defendant had made changes to the organisation of his business on the basis that he would not have to pay in full. It was held that the evidence did not establish this, so that the estoppel argument failed. The promise had not been acted upon in the sense that the defendant had altered his position.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-The extent to which reliance is adequately protected by contract law is a large and current topic of debate. To focus on the immediate issue, however, it makes perfect sense that the promisee should demonstrate reliance before any effect will be given to the promise by estoppel. If it were otherwise, the argument that the promise made no difference to anything would apply with its full and withering force. The requirement of reliance is a threshold qualification in other areas of contract law. In misrepresentation, for instance, an action cannot be maintained if a false statement in no way affected the claimant's judgment.
/->-In the context of promissory estoppel, there has been debate whether the promisee's reliance need be detrimental. A moment's thought should be enough to suggest the correct answer. The facts of <i>High Trees</i> itself can stand as a guide; the locus classicus of promissory estoppel is itself a case of a merely concessionary promise which occasioned no detriment to the promisee and no benefit to the promisor. In a later case (<i>Alan v El Nasr</i> (1972)), Lord *Denning* expressly denied that detrimental reliance was necessary. The true position is best explained in the following case, confirming Lord *Denning*'s view:

CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Characteristics of Promissory Estoppel; Reliance and Inequity
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The facts of this case (the sale of a consignment of palm oil by a lengthy chain of inter-related transactions) are complex and do not add to the following statement of Robert Goff J.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-“I approach the matter as follows. The fundamental principle is that stated by Lord Cairns [in <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway</i>], viz. that the representor will not be allowed to enforce his rights “where it would be inequitable having regard to the dealings which have thus taken place between the parties”. To establish such inequity, it is not necessary to show detriment; indeed, the representee may have benefited from the representation, and yet it may be inequitable, at least without reasonable notice, for the representor to enforce his legal rights. Take the facts of <i>Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd</i> [1947] 1 KB 130, the case in which *Denning J* breathed new life into the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The representation was by a lessor to the effect that he would be content to accept a reduced rent. In such a case, although the lessee has benefited from the reduction in rent, it may well be inequitable for the lessor to insist upon his legal right to the unpaid rent, because the lessee has conducted his affairs on the basis that he would only have to pay rent at the lower rate; and a court might well think it right to conclude that only after reasonable notice could the lessor return to charging rent at the higher rate specified in the lease. Furthermore it would be open to the Court, in any particular case, to infer from the circumstances of the case that the representee must have conducted his affairs in such a way that it would be inequitable for the representor to enforce his rights, or to do so without reasonable notice. But it does not follow that in every case in which the representee has acted, or failed to act, in reliance on the representation, it will be inequitable for the representor to enforce his rights for the nature of the action, or inaction, may be sufficient to give rise to the equity, in which event a necessary requirement stated by Lord Cairns LC for the application for the doctrine would not have been fulfilled”.
/->-If the promisee's reliance on the promise can be characterised as detrimental (detriment being found beyond the mere fact that he may face an action for breach of contract absent the defence of promissory estoppel), then the case may need careful handling. Consider the following decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

CITATION Musumeci v Winadell Pty Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 723
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Characteristics of Promissory Estoppel; Reliance and Inequity
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The plaintiffs were tenants of a shop in a shopping centre owned by the defendants. When the defendants leased another shop in the same centre to a similar business (a fruiterer), the plaintiffs experienced a drop in their turnover. They therefore sought and received a reduction in their rent from the defendants. The reduced rent was paid and accepted even after the defendants had required a return to full rent. At a certain point the defendants changed the locks on the plaintiffs' shop. The plaintiffs sued for damages and succeeded on the basis that the rent had been varied for good consideration. The court held that the promise to reduce the rent had given the defendants the benefit of keeping the shop occupied without having to look for an alternative tenant. It had cost the plaintiffs a detriment in the form of the risk they undertook by continuing to trade against a stronger competitor instead of leaving and cutting their potential losses. Although the plaintiffs were doing no more than what they were originally obliged to do by their lease, <i>Williams v Roffey</i> would be extended to cover this case (here protecting a decreasing rather than an increasing pact). 
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-Since this is an Australian case, it is merely persuasive authority in the courts of this country. What is more, it appears to go directly against the limitation of <i>Williams v Roffey</i> by <i>Re Selectmove</i> (see above). That aside, there are English cases in which a promisee's reliance on a promise has led judges of the same court to go different ways; on more than one occasion Lord *Denning* applied the <i>High Trees</i> doctrine, while others found a binding variation of contract on the basis of detriment or potential detriment. 
/->-The passage from the judgment of Robert Goff J in <i>The Post Chaser</i> above stands as a complete account in principle of the place of inequity in promissory estoppel. Little more needs to be said on a conceptual level, except to remark that there is a ready means of distinguishing between the detriment which might make a promise binding as a variation of the contract, and the inequity which promissory estoppel would remedy. Detriment, whatever form it takes, arises from the acceptance of the promise. Inequity, in an estoppel case, is found at a point later in time – upon the retraction of the promise.
/->-Two cases add examples of courts' reasoning about inequity in the context of estoppel:

SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The plaintiffs, a two-man building firm, did work for Mr and Mrs Rees. When the time came for settlement of the account, the plaintiffs were owed £483. They were in serious financial difficulty, as the defendants knew. Mrs Rees offered £300 in full and final settlement, making it clear that she would pay not a penny more, and that the alternative to acceptance on her terms was nothing. The plaintiffs accepted the sum offered since their circumstances gave them no realistic choice. They later brought an action for the balance. The Court of Appeal held that they succeeded. The majority of the court simply applied <i>Foakes v Beer</i>; on the rule in <i>Pinnel's Case</i> there was no consideration for the plaintiffs' promise to Mrs Rees. Lord *Denning MR* treated the case as one of promissory estoppel, but ruled that the doctrine only applied when necessary to prevent inequity. Since the plaintiffs' promise had been extracted from them by pressure, there was no inequity in allowing them to resile from it and sue for the remainder as the common law allowed them to do.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-D & C Builders</i>, seen through the eyes of Lord Denning, offers a helpful insight into the way in which the <i>High Trees</i> principle can co-exist (just) with <i>Foakes v Beer</i>. <i>Foakes v Beer</i> is good law, as it must be until set aside by the House of Lords itself. However, it yields to the requirements of equity when these dictate a different result.

CITATION Collier v Wright (Holdings) Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 1329
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Characteristics of Promissory Estoppel; Reliance and Inequity
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Pursuant to a county court order, the claimant was bound, together with his two partners, to repay a debt at the rate of £600 a month. The claimant paid £200 a month, initially from the partnership's bank account and later from his own resources. The claimant's two partners were already bankrupt, and the defendant served a statutory demand on him for the full amount of the debt jointly owed. In an application to set aside the statutory demand, the claimant argued (a) that he had agreed with the defendant to give up his status as a joint debtor and to take on the status of a sole debtor for £200 a month, and that this amounted to consideration for a promise that he owed only the lesser sum; and (b) that the defendant was estopped from denying that only the lesser sum was owed. The Court of Appeal held that the first submission failed, but that the second submission raised a “genuine triable issue” sufficient to justify setting aside the statutory demand. In the judgment of *Arden LJ*, the effect of promissory estoppel on the promise to accept the lesser payment was to extinguish the creditor's right to the balance of the debt.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Arden LJ formulated the following proposition as an application of the dicta in <i>High Trees</i> to the present dispute: “The facts of this case demonstrate that, if (1) a debtor offers to pay part only of the amount he owes; (2) the creditor voluntarily accepts that offer, and (3) in reliance on the creditor's acceptance the debtor pays that part of the amount he owes in full, the creditor will, by virtue of the doctrine of promissory estoppel, be bound to accept that sum in full and final satisfaction of the whole debt. For him to resile will of itself be inequitable. In addition, in these circumstances, the promissory estoppel has the effect of extinguishing the creditor's right to the balance of the debt. This part of our law originated in the brilliant obiter dictum of *Denning J* in the High Trees case [1947] KB 130”.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-Longmore LJ, in the same case, was doubtful whether it was inequitable for the defendant to resile from the promise to accept part payment, but accepted that the facts did at least raise a triable issue. Two linked points should be made about Arden LJ's notion of automatic inequity. The first is to emphasise that it applies only to part payment of debt, and not to other settings in which promissory estoppel may come into play. The second is a call for caution. An orthodox understanding of promissory estoppel requires the presence or absence of inequity to be assessed in every case on the facts. It would be strange if one application of promissory estoppel differed from all the others in this respect. What is more, the case by case assessment of what equity may demand has already been proposed above as one of the means by which the <i>High Trees</i> doctrine can claim to co-exist with <i>Foakes v Beer</i> and <i>Pinnel's Case</i>. If promissory estoppel <i>automatically</i> applies to cases of part payment of debt, then <i>Foakes v Beer</i> is left without any application. There is already the authority of <i>Re Selectmove</i> to suggest that this is not consistent with the doctrine of binding precedent.

CITATION Tool Metal Manufacturing Co Ltd v Tungsten Electric Co Ltd [1955] 2 All ER 657
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Characteristics of Promissory Estoppel; Effect of Promissory Estoppel
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-By a contract between the plaintiff (TMMC) and the defendant (TECO), TECO was permitted to deal in alloys subject to TMMC patents subject to a duty to make “compensation” payments to TMMC if more than a certain quota were sold in any month. In 1942 TECO stopped making the payments, and TMMC agreed that they would not claim for them pending negotiation of a new contract. The negotiations failed, and in 1946 TMMC counterclaimed for the payments in an action brought by TECO. The counterclaim was successfully resisted by promissory estoppel, and by the Court of Appeal's finding that rights to the payments could only be revived by the giving of notice. The compensation payments withheld were therefore irrecoverable. In 1950 TMMC brought a fresh action claiming payments due since 1947. This claim succeeded in the House of Lords, which held that notice reviving the right to the payments had been given by the making of the counterclaim in the earlier action. The House of Lords decision contains no criticism of the Court of Appeal judgment in the earlier action which deprived TMMC of its accrued rights to payment.
SUMMARY ~*Detail *~
/->-In the House of Lords, Lord Tucker helpfully gave guidance as to when notice would and would not be required in equity before a promise might be terminated and future contractual rights revived:
/->-“It has been said more than once that every case involving the application of this equitable doctrine [in <i>Hughes v Metropolitan Railway</i>] must depend on its own particular circumstances. It is, of course, clear ... that there are some cases where the period of suspension clearly terminates on the happening of a certain event or the cessation of a previously existing state of affairs or on the lapse of a reasonable period thereafter. In such cases no intimation or notice of any kind may be necessary. But in other cases where there is nothing to fix the end of the period which may be dependent upon the will of the person who has given or made the concession, equity will no doubt require some notice or intimation together with a reasonable period for readjustment before the grantor is allowed to enforce his strict rights. No authority has been cited which binds your Lordships to hold that in all such cases the notice must take any particular form or specify a date for the termination of the suspensory period. This is not surprising having regard to the infinite variety of circumstances which may give rise to this principle which was stated in broad terms and must now be regarded as of general application. It should, I think, be applied with great caution to purely creditor and debtor relationships which involve no question of forfeiture or cancellation, and it would be unfortunate if the law were to introduce into this field technical requirements with regard to notice and the like which might tend to penalise or discourage the making of reasonable concessions”.
/->-One further potential consequence of promissory estoppel which has not been mentioned so far relates to the situation in which notice of a resumption of rights is given, but the promisee has so altered his position in reliance on the promise as to be unable to resume the obligations of the contract. There is only one solution. If it would be inequitable to allow the resumption of rights in all the circumstances, then equity will extinguish them permanently. This is stated by Lord Hodson:




NAME Ajayi (EA) v Briscoe (see above)
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel
SUMMARY ~*Ajayi (EA) v Briscoe (see above)*~
/->-“Their Lordships are of opinion that the principle of law as defined by Bowen LJ [in the <i>Birmingham</i> case] has been confirmed by the House of Lords in the case of <i>Tool Metal Manufacturing Co Ltd v Tungsten Electric Co Ltd</i> where the authorities were reviewed and no encouragement was given to the view that the principle was capable of extension so as to create rights in the promisee for which he had given no consideration. The principle, which has been described as quasi-estoppel and perhaps more aptly as promissory estoppel, is that when one party to a contract in the absence of fresh consideration agrees not to enforce his rights an equity will be raised in favour of the other party. The equity is, however, subject to the qualifications (1) that the other party has altered his position, (2) that the promisor can resile from his promise on giving reasonable notice, which need not be a formal notice, giving the promisee reasonable opportunity of resuming his position, (3) the promise only becomes final and irrevocable if the promisee cannot resume his position”.
/->-Promissory estoppel is an inherently defensive device. It gives effect to a promise unsupported by consideration in the sense that it allows that promise to be set up by its recipient as a defence to a claim that he has not performed in accordance with a contract. This is all is does. Certain conclusions logically follow. The most obvious is that promissory estoppel cannot be used as a cause of action, permitting the promisee to sue for breach of a promise. That can only be done if consideration has been given for the promise (or if it is made under seal, in a deed). A further conclusion, very closely related to the first, is that promissory estoppel can only operate within the context of a pre-existing contract. That, at least, remains the position in this jurisdiction.




NAME Combe v Combe.
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-This case has already been cited in the preceding lecture, but the facts are given again here for ease of reference.
/->-At the time of their divorce, a husband promised his wife that he would make annual maintenance payments to her. He never did so. She had a right to apply to the Divorce Court for an order for maintenance but did not (in fact her income was larger than that of her husband). She sued for arrears of payment, arguing (inter alia) that she had given consideration for her husband's promise to pay by promising not to apply to the court for a maintenance order. The judge at first instance (Byrne J) held that there was no consideration, but that the principle of promissory estoppel applied; the husband's promise was intended to be acted upon and was in fact acted upon. The Court of Appeal held that this was not a case of promissory estoppel. Lord *Denning* candidly observed that much as he was inclined to favour the principle stated in <i>High Trees</i>, it was important that it should not be stretched too far, lest it be endangered. It might be part of a cause of action, but it could not stand as a cause of action alone. Birkett LJ adopted the expression of counsel for the husband in these proceedings; promissory estoppel was “a shield, and not a sword”. 
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-The notion that promissory estoppel can be deployed as part of a cause of action, but not as a cause of action itself, may need some explanation. What is envisaged is that the claimant may base an action on some accepted cause, such as breach of contract, and defeat the other side's defence to it, or their counterclaim, by pleading a promissory estoppel. The <i>Tool Metal </i>case (above) in the Court of Appeal is an example of this.
/->-In certain other common law jurisdictions (notably the United States) promissory estoppel has outgrown this limitation. The best-known example is the following case, decided by the High Court of Australia. It is principally of academic interest, since English law on this point appears to be settled.

NAME Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher
CITATION Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher (1988) 76 ALR 513
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Characteristics of Promissory Estoppel; Limit on Use of Promissory Estoppel
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Maher owned a building and had been negotiating with Waltons for a deal whereby Maher would demolish the building, build a new one, and lease it to Waltons. Maher signed his part of the proposed lease, sent it to Waltons for exchange to take place, and began to demolish the building. Meanwhile, Waltons had second thoughts about the whole deal. They nevertheless waited until 40% of the demolition and construction work had been done, and then informed Maher that they were not going ahead. Maher sought a declaration, arguing that Waltons were estopped from breaking an implied promise to complete the lease agreement. The court held that this was correct. The conduct of Waltons amounted to a clear inducement to Maher to suffer detriment by acting on an assumption which Waltons knew to be incorrect, and as such, it was unconscionable. Waltons would be estopped from retreating from its implied promise to complete the contract. Alternatively (and still more radically) the court would apply estoppel to prevent Waltons from denying that a contract had come into existence.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_Brennan J in the above case suggests that “…there is a logical difficulty in limiting the principle [of promissory estoppel] so that it applies only to promises to suspend or extinguish existing rights. If a promise by A not to enforce an existing right against B is to confer an equitable right on B to compel fulfilment of the promise, why should B be denied the same protection in similar circumstances if the promise is intended to create in B a new legal right against A? There is no logical distinction to be drawn between a change in legal relationships effected by a promise which extinguishes a right and a change in legal relationships effected by a promise which creates one. Why should an equity of the kind to which Combe v Combe refers be regarded as a shield but not a sword?”_
/->-_Brennan J is right, but there is a way of explaining why estoppel might normally be only a defence while in exceptional circumstances (though not yet in England) it might be used as an attack. Promissory estoppel, as an equitable doctrine, could be said to concern itself not only with the protection of B, the promise, but in a proper case also with the behaviour of A, and indeed the conscience of A. That follows from the origins of equity, and the facts of the present case demand this additional perspective; the behaviour of Waltons was unconscionable. It would not be an unreasonable state of affairs if equity normally afforded only a defence to protect B, but exceptionally went further to give B a cause of action to meet the additional element of A's unconscionable conduct. _
