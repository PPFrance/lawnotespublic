SUMMARY ~*Introduction*~
/->-The last lecture, in its second half, addressed the implication of terms into contracts by the courts. It would seem natural to go straight on to deal with the terms implied (or more accurately imposed) by statute. However, the study of those terms will require you to address not only their content, but also their status. For that reason, it is most convenient to deal first with the status of contractual terms generally, in order to explain the common law scheme which Parliament has built upon in some of its most important commercial legislation.
/->-That scheme, which comprises two levels of terms and associated remedies, is simple to the point of being rigid. Through the device of the “innominate” term, the common law has found a way beyond the limitations of its traditional approach, although it is one which exists in an uneasy tension with the value of certainty in commercial law.
/->-The second part of the lecture is largely devoted to the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and reproduces the text of some of the most important sections of the Act with minimal comment. These are the sections which imply terms of primary importance into commercial contracts. For the purposes of this year, students are not expected to go further than to develop some familiarity with the most important provisions. These are printed in bold type. The surrounding sections of the Act are given by way of context and linkage.
/->-The lecture touches on similar provisions in the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, and reproduces sections 13-15 of that Act, before turning to the changes made by the Consumer Rights Act 2015. The sections taken from the two earlier statutes are shown as amended by the 2015 legislation. This statutory material will be discussed to some extent in tutorials. 




NAME The basics
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Classification of Terms
SUMMARY ~*The basics*~
/->-Broadly speaking, a contractual term may be classified as either a warranty, or a condition, or an innominate term. The distinction between warranties and conditions is of long standing, and became entrenched in English contract law after the Sale of Goods Act 1983 adopted it. The category of “intermediate” or “innominate” terms has been introduced into the law comparatively recently, by the 1962 judgment of *Diplock LJ* in the <i>Hong Kong Fir</i> case, and will be discussed in due course.
/->-The distinction between warranties and conditions ultimately depends, like so much analysis of contract, upon the parties' intention. Nevertheless, although that may be the principled bedrock upon which the distinction is established, it will often be reached in practice by express analysis of how important the term in question is. Conditions are the more important terms of the contract. Warranties are the less important terms. The distinction is therefore drawn in a way which closely resembles the law's approach to identifying pre-contractual statements as terms or representations.
/->-The distinction has crucial consequences in terms of the remedies which will be available for breach of a given term. 
/->-The breach of condition brings about a more complex situation. The wronged party has a choice (or “election”) to make, since breach of condition creates the entitlement either to terminate the contract (and sue for damages as well if necessary), or to “accept the breach” and sue only for damages, while providing and hoping to receive continued performance of the contract.

NAME Further aspects of the remedial scheme

CATEGORY Classification of Terms
SUMMARY ~*Further aspects of the remedial scheme*~
/->-Perhaps the first issue, for the purposes of developing an understanding of what has been stated above, is to touch on the circumstances in which the wronged party may wish only to sue for damages in connection with a breach of condition. It may seem slightly odd that a party would choose to forego the apparently superior remedy of termination. The answer is an entirely practical one. There could be more than one reason why the wronged party would not wish to terminate the contract, even though the law presents that option. For instance, the ongoing trading relationship with the party in breach may be of the utmost importance. Damages may well constitute sufficient compensation for the breach, while termination would destroy the commercial relationship.
/->-The election, once made, is binding. If it is decided only to sue for damages in connection with a breach of condition, then further performance under the contract remains due from either party. There can be no second thoughts. Equally, if it is decided to terminate the contract, it cannot later be revived.
/->-More than that turns on the election. If one party purports to terminate the contract on account of the other's breach of condition, the other may object (and perhaps later prove in court) that the term breached was not a condition but merely a warranty, or even that no term was breached. If that is so, then the termination of contract will itself be a breach – wrongful repudiation.
/->-It is therefore of the utmost importance that the law on this topic should be clear, so that parties can know with certainty what rights they have. That being said, there is a competing legal value which creates tension in this area. While being certain, the law also needs to deliver a proportionate scheme of remedies. It therefore needs to show a degree of elasticity.




NAME Conditions
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Classification of Terms; Classification of Terms; Conditions
SUMMARY ~*Conditions*~
/->-One way in which the parties can (in theory) ensure clarity and at least some proportionality is by classifying their obligations themselves at the time of contracting as either conditions or warranties. The question, as the next case shows, is whether a court will feel bound to accept such a classification.
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The parties entered into a “distributorship agreement” by which Wickman was to act as agent in obtaining buyers for panel presses manufactured by Schuler, a German company. The agreement was to last for four and a half years. Clause 7(b) of the agreement stated that “it shall be condition of this agreement that (i) [Wickman] shall send its representatives to visit [the six large UK motor manufacturers] at least once in every week for the purpose of soliciting orders for panel presses ...”. Clause 11a gave to either party the right to terminate the agreement if the other had committed a material breach which remained unremedied within sixty days of the other's notice in writing. Wickman did not make all the weekly visits required by the agreement. Schuler terminated it immediately, claiming that Wickman was in breach of condition, and that by its nature the breach could not be remedied. Since the possibility of remedy under clause 11 had no application on this view, Schuler claimed the ordinary remedy for breach of condition untrammelled by the need to give a sixty day warning.
/->-The House of Lords held, by a majority, that Schuler had had no entitlement to terminate the contract. Lord Reid said that the agreement was badly drafted, but that one available construction (avoiding absurdity) was that a few missed visits could be remedied by improving procedures for the future. Schuler should therefore have acted in accordance with the provisions of clause 11, rather than immediately terminating the contract. Lord Wilberforce, dissenting, was of the view that there was no basis for the assumption that the parties had adopted “a standard of easygoing tolerance rather than one of aggressive, insistent punctuality and efficiency”, and that the drafting of the agreement in fact indicated the latter.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-In the following explanation by Lord Reid of his reasoning, the reference to “rescinding” the contract should be read as “terminating the contract”. 
/->-“Schuler maintains that the word "condition" has now acquired a precise legal meaning; that, particularly since the enactment of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, its recognised meaning in English law is a term of a contract any breach of which by one party gives to the other party an immediate right to rescind the whole contract. Undoubtedly the word is frequently used in that sense. There may, indeed, be some presumption that in a formal legal document it has that meaning. But it is frequently used with a less stringent meaning. One is familiar with printed "Conditions of Sale" incorporated into a contract, and with the words "For conditions see back" printed on the ticket. There it simply means that the "conditions" are terms of the contract.
/->-In the ordinary use of the English language "condition" has many meanings, some of which have nothing to do with agreements. In connection with an agreement it may mean a pre-condition: something which must happen or be done before the agreement can take effect. Or it may mean some state of affairs which must continue to exist if the agreement is to remain in force. The legal meaning on which Schuler relies is, I think, one which would not occur to a layman; a condition in that sense is not something which has an automatic effect. It is a term the breach of which by one party gives to the other an option either to terminate the contract or to let the contract proceed and, if he so desires, sue for damages for the breach.
/->-Sometimes a breach of a term gives that option to the aggrieved party because it is of a fundamental character going to the root of the contract, sometimes it gives that option because the parties have chosen to stipulate that it shall have that effect. Blackburn J. said in <b><i>Bettini v Gye </i></b>(1875) L.R. 1 Q.B.D. 183: <i>"Parties may think some matter, apparently of very
/->-little importance, essential; and if they sufficiently express an intention to make the literal fulfilment of such a thing a condition precedent, it will be one."
/->-In the present case it is not contended that Wickman's failures to make visits amounted in themselves to fundamental breaches. What is contended is that the terms of clause 7 <i>"sufficiently express an intention </i>" to make any breach, however small, of the obligation to make visits a condition so that any such breach shall entitle Schuler to rescind the
/->-Schuler maintains that the use of the word "condition" is in itself enough to establish this intention. No doubt some words used by lawyers do have a rigid inflexible meaning. But we must remember that we are seeking to discover intention as disclosed by the contract as a whole. Use of the word "condition" is an indication—even a strong indication—of such an
/->-ntention but it is by no means conclusive. The fact that a particular construction leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration. The more unreasonable the result the more unlikely it is that the parties can have intended it, and if they do intend it the more
/->-necessary it is that they shall make that intention abundantly clear”.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-As Professor *McKendrick* notes, the key to understanding this case lies in the relationship between clauses 7 and 11 of the parties' contract. He concludes, surely rightly, that if no more had been in play than the agreement's characterisation of even a single, venial breach as a breach of condition, then there would have been very little basis for arguing that it was not a condition. That drafting would have been a clear indication of the parties' intention. However, clause 11 provided contractual machinery which the majority thought capable of barring the consequence that any breach should immediately justify termination.
/->-McKendrick also makes the valuable point that the majority's decision left Schuler liable for wrongfully repudiating the contract. Wickman was therefore free to accept that breach (if it wished), and sue Schuler for all the profits which Wickman could show it would have earned over the lifetime of the agency. As for Schuler's action for what it had thought to be a “breach of condition”, it would have been downgraded to the right to bring a counterclaim for such damage as it could show was caused by the missed visits.
/->-Despite these somewhat surprising consequences of the majority's decision, <i>Schuler v Wickman</i> stands as the leading authority in English law on the distinction between conditions and warranties.

NAME Warranties
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Classification of Terms; Classification of Terms; Warranties
SUMMARY ~*Warranties*~
/->-As stated above, warranties are essentially the less important terms of the contract, which the parties may be deemed to have intended only to be underwritten by a remedy in damages.
/->-A fuller and more satisfactory definition than this is not readily available. The interpretation section of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 defines a warranty as “collateral to the main purpose of the contract”, and this must be contrasted with the frequent observation in the cases that conditions “go to the root of the contract”. “Collateral” here seems to have much the sense of “secondary” or “inessential”. The fact is that the words “warranty” and “condition” have often been used in English law with no apparent precision, but rather to point up the difference of something from something else (compare the various ways in which the expression “common law” has been used to mark a distinction – from equity, from statute, from civilian law, etc). 
/->-Glosses upon the meaning of “warranty” in some decisions accordingly need to be treated warily. For example, where “warranty” is used in the cases to contrast with non-contractual “representations”, it has already been seen that one supposed characteristic of a warranty is the emphasis placed upon it, or even its decisive effect upon one party's willingness to contract with the other. These associations of the word really have to be put away as irrelevant to the present topic, or even misleading. 




NAME Innominate terms
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Classification of Terms
SUMMARY ~*Innominate terms*~
/->-In order to understand the challenge brought to the bipartite scheme of classification by cases in the mid twentieth century, following <i>Hong Kong Fir </i>(below), it is essential to bear in mind that the traditional classification does not look beyond the moment of contracting. This is because it is based upon the intention of the parties, and their intention must appear from the contract. 
/->-Once the contract is formed, there is no further guide to the parties' intentions, so that there is no reason for the courts to look beyond that point in time. Clearly, courts do in fact look beyond that point in time in so far as they compare performance of the contract with its terms in order to decide whether there has been a breach, but traditionally they do not do so in order to construe the contract. 
/->-If, however, one's concern is with the proportionality of the remedy for breach of contract provided by the law, it may be of the greatest importance to look beyond the moment of contract formation to the breach which has actually occurred. Whatever the importance of the term which has been breached, proportionality must partly consist in the remedy being suited to the <i>breach</i>, and not just to the <i>term</i>. It may well be that a very important term could be breached in a very minor way, causing little loss, and vice versa. An appropriate remedy is one which most truly offers compensation for loss in fact suffered.
/->-We should therefore enter the field of innominate terms aware that the orthodox approach to the classification of a term refuses to be influenced by the nature of the breach, while a different perspective characterises the actual breach as possibly decisive.

CATEGORY Classification of Terms; Classification of Terms; Innominate Terms
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-By a time charter, the charterers were to have the vessel Hong Kong Fir for 24 months. Clause 1 on the charter stated that the vessel was “in every way fitted for ordinary cargo service” (the “seaworthiness clause”). The shipowners were bound to keep the vessel in a fit state. Any repair taking more than 24 hours would cause the payment of hire to be suspended. Such “off-hire” days could be added on to the overall duration of the charter, at the charterers' option. The vessel was in fact off-hire for substantial periods as a result of engine trouble and the incompetence of the short-handed crew. Not long after the charter period began, the market rate for freight carriage dropped, so that the charterers could have obtained a ship more cheaply. The charterers wrote to the shipowners to terminate the contract for breach of condition.
/->-At first instance, the judge found that the contract had been wrongfully repudiated. The Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. Sellers LJ stated that the seaworthiness clause was a warranty. Upjohn LJ said that the question was whether the breach of the clause went so much to the root of the contract as to make its further commercial performance impossible. *Diplock LJ* said that the seaworthiness clause was to be viewed as neither a condition nor a warranty, but as an “intermediate” or “innominate” term for breach of which the remedy would be the one best apportioned to the breach itself and its consequences.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-a name="para54"></a><a name="para53"></a>“Lawyers tend to speak of [the bipartite classification of terms] as if it were comprehensive, partly for the historical reasons which I have already mentioned and partly because Parliament itself adopted it in the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, as respects a number of implied terms in contracts for the sale of goods and has in that Act used the expressions "condition" and "warranty" in that meaning. But it is by no means true of contractual undertakings in general at common law.
/->-a name="para55">No doubt there are many simple contractual undertakings, sometimes express but more often because of their very simplicity ("It goes without saying") to be implied, of which it can be predicated that every breach of such an undertaking must give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract. And such a stipulation, unless the parties have agreed that breach of it shall not entitle the non-defaulting party to treat the contract as repudiated, is a "condition". So too there may be other simple contractual undertakings of which it can be predicated that no breach can give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract; and such a stipulation, unless the parties have agreed that breach of it shall entitle the non-defaulting party to treat the contract as repudiated, is a "warranty ".</a
/->-a name="para56">There are, however, many contractual undertakings of a more complex character which cannot be categorised as being "conditions" or "warranties" if the late nineteenth century meaning adopted in the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, and used by Lord Justice Bowen in Bensen v. Taylor Sons & Co. (1893 2 Queen's Bench page 274, at page 280) be given to those terms. Of such undertakings all that can be predicated is that some breaches will and others will not give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract;and the legal consequences of a breach of such an undertaking, unless provided for expressly in the contract, depend upon the nature of the event to which the breach gives rise and do not follow automatically from a prior classification of the undertaking as a "condition" or a "warranty". </a><a name="para57"></a
/->-a name="para58">As my brethren have already pointed out, the shipowner's undertaking to tender a seaworthy ship has, as a result of numerous decisions as to what can amount to "unseaworthiness", become one of the most complex of contractual undertakings. It embraces obligations with respect to every part of the hull and machinery, stores and equipment and the crew itself. It can be broken by the presence of trivial defects easily and rapidly remediable as well as by defects which must inevitably result in a total loss of the vessel.</a
/->-a name="para59">Consequently the problem in this case is, in my view, neither solved nor soluble by debating whether the shipowner's express or implied undertaking to tender a seaworthy ship is a "condition" or a "warranty". It is like so many other contractual terms an undertaking one breach of which may give rise to an event which relieves the charterer of further performance of his undertakings if he so elects and another breach of which may not give rise to such an event but entitle him only to monetary compensation in the form of damages. It is, with all deference to Mr. Ashton Roskill's skilful argument, by no means surprising that among the many hundreds of previous cases about the shipowner's undertaking to deliver a seaworthy ship there is none where it was found profitable to discuss in the judgments the question whether that undertaking is a "condition" or a "warranty"; for the true answer, as I have already indicated, is that it is neither, but one of that large class of contractual undertakings one breach of which may have the same effect as that ascribed to a breach of "condition" under the Sale of Goods Act and a different breach of which may have only the same effect as that ascribed to a breach of "warranty" under that Act.</a><a name="para60">...</a
/->-What the learned judge had to do in the present case as in any other case where one party to a contract relies upon a breach by the other party as giving him a right to elect to rescind the contract, was to look at the events which had occurred as a result of the breach at the time at which the charterers purported to rescind the charter-party and to decide whether the occurrence of those events deprived the charterers of substantially the whole benefit which it was the intention of the parties as expressed in the charter-party that the charterers should obtain from the further performance of their own contractual undertakings”.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-How does the orthodox classification co-exist with Lord Diplock's analysis? The orthodox labelling of terms as conditions or warranties remains prima facie appropriate where the labels have been applied by the parties, and it is also holds where the term under examination is one which can be breached only in a restricted range of ways. Later cases emphatically add that the orthodox classification continues to govern where it is mandated by binding authority in respect of specific terms. Beyond these instances, the innominate analysis appears to be the correct one.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_In the application of that analysis it is easy to take a wrong step by regarding an innominate term as effectively a condition if the consequences of its breach are serious, and a warranty if otherwise. If this were right, Lord Diplock would have achieved little; the innominate analysis would merely identify terms in a middle ground, and use the consequences of breach as a prompt to help decide which way they should go._
/->-_The innominate understanding of terms is more than a way of introducing some order into the debatable middle ground between conditions and warranties. It has deep jurisprudential roots in the historical development of contract law. The breach of an innominate term will justify termination of the contract only where it deprives the wronged party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract – the threshold for termination is set very high. The explanation for this is that Lord Diplock means to derive termination for breach from the same stratum within contract that produces termination for frustration (where the contract, without fault of either party, has become impossible or effectively impossible of performance). His full discussion of these parallel doctrines, as he regards them, has not been reproduced above for reasons of space, but it includes his perception that the right to terminate arises not so much from the fact of breach itself, as from the event which the breach constitutes. In parallel with the law of frustration, where it is axiomatic that frustration operates automatically, and in parallel with the doctrine of conditions precedent, the event simply leaves the parties free of further obligations to each other. _
/->-_On this view, it is actually the continuing liberty of the wronged party to elect to keep the contract going which starts to appear anomalous. The radical equation of lines of contractual reasoning which Lord Diplock is seeking to bring about in the Hong Kong Fir seems to leave little room for that choice. An associated point is astutely made by Megaw LJ in the later case of Bunge Corpn v Tradax (1981). If, ex hypothesi, the choice between termination and affirmation of the contract only exists where the wronged party has been deprived of substantially the whole benefit that the contract was to provide, why would a party in that position ever wish to affirm?_
/->-_Hong Kong Fir is not the only exercise in jurisprudence by Lord Diplock which excites admiration mixed with the slight unease that it may prove too much. _

NAME Making the election to affirm or terminate

CATEGORY Classification of Terms
SUMMARY ~*Making the election to affirm or terminate*~
/->-Before we proceed further with the cases on innominate terms, it is worth taking a detour to look more closely at the election which the wronged party makes in response to breach of condition or innominate term rendering the contract terminable. The current law does not place any controls upon the making of this election, so that it can be informed purely by commercial opportunism. Professor Brownsword, in “Retrieving Reasons, Retrieving Rationality? A New Look at the Right to Withdraw for Breach of Contract” (1992) 5 Journal of Contract Law, 83, examines the principles which could be applied in this context. In the course of doing so, he helpfully sheds light on the reasons which might be given by a party seeking to terminate a contract for breach:
/->-“Without any claim to being exhaustive of possible good reasons, six arguable grounds for the right to withdraw may be suggested as follows:
/->-(1) the contract breaker evinces, through the breach, a lack of commitment to the contract as a source of obligation (for example, the breach is intentional/calculating, or fraud/dishonesty is involved);
/->-(2) the breach raises concerns about the competence of the contract-breaker (for example, the breach involves negligence);
/->-(3) the breach, although unintentional and non-negligent, renders performance under the contract radically different from that envisaged at formation;
/->-(4) proving (or quantifying) losses flowing from the breach gives rise to difficulties which put the innocent party at risk;
/->-(5) the breach gives rise to concern about the contract-breaker's ability to meet future claims; and
/->-(6) the breach gives rise to concern about the <i>innocent</i> party's own ability to perform either the contract in question of another's associated contract”.
/->-Professor Brownsword goes on to suppose, within this exercise in imagining how the law might reasonably be, that the party claiming the right to withdraw would need to make out a prima facie case for the applicability of one of the reasons above, and would need to be acting in good faith. The onus would then shift to the other party to rebut the other's case.
/->-It must be stressed that the above proposals are not law – the assertion of the right to terminate is at the sole discretion of the wronged party. However, the scheme above offers a useful insight into some of the practical considerations which presumably inform that exercise of discretion even on the present state of the law. It is also instructive to notice that Brownsword's proposals move in the opposite direction from one aspect of *Diplock LJ*'s analysis in the Hong Kong Fir. Termination, on that jurisprudential analysis, tended to be seen as the default position, if not as technically automatic.

/->-Several major commercial cases discuss the <i>Hong Kong Fir</i>. The temptation to set them all out at length here will be resisted, but the final one to be cited below (<i>Bunge Corpn v Tradax</i>) does give a clear direction to future courts which justifies fuller quotation from it.




NAME The Mihalis Angelos
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Clause 1 of a charterparty for a voyage from Haiphong to Hamburg stated that the ship was “expected ready to load under this charter about 1 July 1965”. In fact there were no good grounds to expect the ship to be ready to load on or around that date, since she was still engaged on another charter. The charterers, meanwhile, found that as a result (so they thought) of the war in Vietnam they could not obtain the expected cargo, and terminated the charter claiming force majeure. This ground of termination was found to be invalid. In the shipowners' action for damages for wrongful repudiation, the issue for the court was whether a breach of Clause 1 gave a right to terminate the contract.
/->-In the Court of Appeal, Megaw LJ held that Clause 1 was a condition, so that its breach did give rise to the right to terminate. Binding authority led to this conclusion. Furthermore, the law needed to be predictable. It was preferable, in a case of this type, that both parties and their advisors should know where they stood, rather than having to wonder whether a court would find that a breach went to the root of the contract. The charterers' right to terminate was not affected by the fact that they had initially asserted it for an invalid reason.




NAME The Hansa Nord
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-A contract for the sale of citrus pulp pellets to be used in the manufacture of cattle feed provided by Clause 7 for “shipment to be made in good condition”. The contract price was £100,000. Over a third of the pellets were damaged during shipment. The market price of pellets had meanwhile fallen, and the buyers rejected the consignment, claiming that the right to terminate arose from breach of condition. In fact they later repurchased the pellets from a third party for £30,000, and used them for the purpose originally intended.
/->-The Court of Appeal held that Clause 7 was neither a condition nor a warranty. In order to establish that its breach gave rise to the right to terminate the contract, it was necessary in line with the reasoning in the <i>Hong Kong Fir</i> to show that it went to the root of the contract. On these facts that could not be shown. Lord *Denning MR* embraced the innominate term analysis with some enthusiasm, holding that it could apply to sales of goods disputes notwithstanding the express use of the condition/warranty dichotomy in the Sale of Goods Act.

CITATION Bunge Corporation v Tradax Export SA [1981] 1 WLR 711
CATEGORY Classification of Terms; Classification of Terms; Innominate Terms
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-By Clause 7 of a contract, the buyers of a consignment of soya bean meal were to give the sellers “at least 15 consecutive days' notice of probable readiness of vessel[s] and of the approximate quantity to be loaded”. Notice of readiness to load was in fact given on 17 June, and was therefore insufficient if the goods were to be shipped before the end of that month, as the contract required. The sellers treated this as a breach of condition entitling them to terminate the contract. The buyers argued that Clause 7 was an innominate term, so that the shortfall in notice had to be assessed in order to decide whether it deprived the other party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract.
/->-The House of Lords held that on its contextual construction, the term as to notice was a condition. *Diplock LJ* in the <i>Hong Kong Fir</i> had been concerned to show that the dichotomy of warranties and conditions did not occupy the entire field of contract terms. He had not intended to provide an easy escape to contract breakers from the consequences of breach of condition. Time provisions in mercantile contracts would usually be of the essence, so that their breach would justify termination. 
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Lord Wilberforce, commenting on the submissions made by counsel for the buyers, distinguished the <i>Hong Kong Fir</i>:
/->-“This argument, in my opinion, is based upon a dangerous misunderstanding, or misapplication, of what was decided and said in <i>Hong Kong Fir. </i>That case was concerned with an obligation of seaworthiness, breaches of which had occurred during the course of the voyage. The decision of the Court of Appeal was that this obligation was not a condition, a breach of which entitled the charterer to repudiate. It was pointed out that, as could be seen in advance the breaches, which might occur of it, were various. They might be extremely trivial, the omission of a nail; they might be extremely grave, a serious defect in the hull or in the machinery; they might be of serious but not fatal gravity, incompetence or incapacity of the crew. The decision, and the judgments of the Court of Appeal, drew from these facts the inescapable conclusion that it was impossible to ascribe to the obligation, in advance, the character of a condition.
/->-Diplock LJ then generalised this particular consequence into the analysis which has since become classical. The fundamental fallacy of the appellant's argument lies in attempting to apply this analysis to a time clause such as the present in a mercantile contract, which is totally different in character. As to such a clause there is only one kind of breach possible, namely, to be late, and the questions which have to be asked are, first, what importance have the parties expressly ascribed to this consequence, and secondly, in the absence of expressed agreement, what consequence ought to be attached to it having regard to the contract as a whole.
/->-The test suggested by the appellants was a different one. One must consider, they said, the breach actually committed and then decide whether that default would deprive the party not in default of substantially the whole benefit of the contract. They invoked even certain passages in the judgment of Diplock LJ in <i>Hong Kong Fir </i>to support it. One may observe in the first place that the introduction of a test of this kind would be commercially most undesirable. It would expose the parties, after a breach of one, two, three, seven and other numbers of days to an argument whether this delay would have left time for the seller to provide the goods. It would make it, at the time, at least difficult, and sometimes impossible, for the supplier to know whether he could do so. It would fatally remove from a vital provision in the contract that certainty which is the most indispensable quality of mercantile contracts, and lead to a large increase in arbitrations. It would confine the seller—perhaps after arbitration and reference through the courts—to a remedy in damages which might be extremely difficult to quantify. These are all serious objections in practice. But I am clear<br 
/->-that the submission is unacceptable in law. The judgment of Diplock LJ does not give any support and ought not to give any encouragement to any such proposition; for beyond doubt it recognises that it is open to the parties to agree that, as regards a particular obligation, any breach shall entitle the party not in default to treat the contract as repudiated. Indeed, if he were not doing so he would, in a passage which does not profess to be more than clarificatory, be discrediting a long and uniform series of cases—at least from <i>Bowes </i>v. <i>Shand </i>(1877) 2 App. Cas. 455 onwards which have been referred to by my noble and learned friend. Lord Roskill. It remains true, as Lord Roskill has pointed out in <i>Cehave N.V. </i>v. <i>Bremer Handelsgesellschaft m.b.H. </i>[1976] 1 Q.B. 44, that the courts should not be too ready to interpret contractual clauses as conditions. And I have myself commended, and continue to commend, the greater flexibility in the law of contracts to which <i>Hong Kong Fir </i>points the way <i>(Reardon Smith Line Ltd. </i>v. <i>Hansen-Tangen </i>[1976] 1 W.L.R. 989, 998). But I do not doubt that, in suitable cases, the courts should not be reluctant, if the intentions of the<br 
/->-arties as shown by the contract so indicate, to hold that an obligation has the force of a condition, and that indeed they should usually do so in the case of time clauses in mercantile contracts”. 
/->-To read a contract without an awareness of the vital provisions which may be implied into it by statute would be an entirely pointless exercise.
/->-Numerous statutes and other instruments may imply terms into contracts. For the purposes of this year, no more than a first approach is made to the legislative impact on the contents of contracts. To achieve practical competence in this area would require study; the GDL course attempts at least to lay the foundations of an understanding of how statute influences the interpretation and litigation of contracts.
/->-Most of the material which follows is provided only to give the context in which a few, extremely important provisions occur. These, which are printed in bold, need to be learnt. One or two sections which are particularly relevant to subjects covered later in the course are also in bold.
/->-The Sale of Goods Act 1979 remains very close in structure and content to the original Act passed in 1893. This was a codifying Act, drafted by Sir Mackenzie Chalmers with a view to summing up actual mercantile practice and expectations as faithfully as possible. Before being passed, it was scrutinised in particular by Lords Herschell, *Bramwell* and Halsbury, as well as others. The 1893 Act was repealed in 1979, but that should not be taken to be a sign that it had outlived its usefulness. Far from it; in fact the 1979 Act which replaced it closely followed its structure and reproduced a great deal of its content.
/->-The Sale of Goods Act is one of the corner-stones of English commercial law, together with the loyalty and responsiveness which the courts have shown to parties' contractually expressed intentions. It has deserved to be carefully maintained and, when necessary, updated. The 1979 Act has itself been amended, and some of the changes to it will be noted after the main run of text, together with very limited commentary on certain provisions. The most significant modification is that from 1 October 2015 the 1979 Act and the 1982 Supply of Goods and Services Act <b>no longer apply to consumer contracts</b>. These are now regulated by the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Changes made by that Act to the original legislation have been printed below in italics.
/->-(1) This Act applies to contracts of sale of goods made on or after (but not to those made before) 1 January 1894.
/->-(2) In relation to contracts made on certain dates, this Act applies subject to the modification of certain of its sections as mentioned in Schedule 1 below.
/->-(3) Any such modification is indicated in the section concerned by a reference to Schedule 1 below.
/->-(4) Accordingly, where a section does not contain such a reference, this Act applies in relation to the contract concerned without such modification of the section.
/->-(5) Certain sections or subsections of this Act do not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies.
/->-b>(1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract by which the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a money consideration, called the price.</b
/->-(2) There may be a contract of sale between one part owner and another.
/->-(4) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer the contract is called a sale.
/->-(5) Where under a contract of sale the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition later to be fulfilled the contract is called an agreement to sell.
/->-(6) An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred.
/->-(1) Capacity to buy and sell is regulated by the general law concerning capacity to contract and to transfer and acquire property.
/->-(2) Where necessaries are sold and delivered [to a minor or] to a person who by reason of [mental incapacity or] drunkenness is incompetent to contract, he must pay a reasonable price for them.
/->-(3) In subsection (2) above “necessaries” means goods suitable to the condition in life of the [minor or other] person concerned and to his actual requirements at the time of the sale and delivery.
/->-(1) Subject to this and any other Act, a contract of sale may be made in writing (either with or without seal), or by word of mouth, or partly in writing and partly by word of mouth, or may be implied from the conduct of the parties.
/->-(1) The goods which form the subject of a contract of sale may be either existing goods, owned or possessed by the seller, or goods to be manufactured or acquired by him after the making of the contract of sale, in this Act called future goods.
/->-(2) There may be a contract for the sale of goods the acquisition of which by the seller depends on a contingency which may or may not happen.
/->-(3) Where by a contract of sale the seller purports to effect a present sale of future goods, the contract operates as an agreement to sell the goods.
/->-b>Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the goods without the knowledge of the seller have perished at the time when the contract is made, the contract is void.</b
/->-Where there is an agreement to sell specific goods and subsequently the goods, without any fault on the part of the seller or buyer, perish before the risk passes to the buyer, the agreement is avoided.
/->-b>(1) The price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in a manner agreed by the contract, or may be determined by the course of dealing between the parties.</b
/->-b>(2) Where the price is not determined as mentioned in sub-section (1) above the buyer must pay a reasonable price.</b
/->-b>(3) What is a reasonable price is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case</b>.
/->-(1 )Unless a different intention appears from the terms of the contract, stipulations as to time of payment are not of the essence of a contract of sale.
/->-(2) Whether any other stipulation as to time is or is not of the essence of the contract depends on the terms of the contract.
/->-(3) In a contract of sale “month” prima facie means calendar month.
/->-b>(2) Where a contract of sale is subject to a condition to be fulfilled by the seller, the buyer may waive the condition, or may elect to treat the breach of the condition as a breach of warranty and not as a ground for treating the contract as repudiated.</b
/->-b>(3) Whether a stipulation in a contract of sale is a condition, the breach of which may give rise to a right to treat the contract as repudiated, or a warranty, the breach of which may give rise to a claim for damages but not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated, depends in each case on the construction of the contract; and a stipulation may be a condition, though called a warranty in the contract.</b
/->-(4) Subject to section 35A below where a contract of sale is not severable and the buyer has accepted the goods or part of them, the breach of a condition to be fulfilled by the seller can only be treated as a breach of warranty, and not as a ground for rejecting the goods and treating the contract as repudiated, unless there is an express or implied term of the contract to that effect.
/->-(4A) Subsection (4) does not apply to a Contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in sections 19 to 22 of that Act).
/->-(6) Nothing in this section affects a condition or warranty whose fulfilment is excused by law by reason of impossibility or otherwise.
/->-(7) Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 below applies in relation to a contract made before 22 April 1967 or (in the application of this Act to Northern Ireland) 28 July 1967.
/->-b>(1) In a contract of sale, other than one to which subsection (3) below applies, there is an implied [term] on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale he has a right to sell the goods, and in the case of an agreement to sell he will have such a right at the time when the property is to pass.</b
/->-(2) In a contract of sale, other than one to which subsection (3) below applies, there is also an implied [term] that—
/->-(a) the goods are free, and will remain free until the time when the property is to pass, from any charge or encumbrance not disclosed or known to the buyer before the contract is made, and
/->-(b) the buyer will enjoy quiet possession of the goods except so far as it may be disturbed by the owner or other person entitled to the benefit of any charge or encumbrance so disclosed or known.
/->-(3) This subsection applies to a contract of sale in the case of which there appears from the contract or is to be inferred from its circumstances an intention that the seller should transfer only such title as he or a third person may have.
/->-(4) In a contract to which subsection (3) above applies there is an implied [<href="#commentary-c1108890" title="View the commentary text for this item">F6</a>term] that all charges or encumbrances known to the seller and not known to the buyer have been disclosed to the buyer before the contract is made.
/->-(5) In a contract to which subsection (3) above applies there is also an implied [<href="#commentary-c1108890" title="View the commentary text for this item">F6</a>term] that none of the following will disturb the buyer's quiet possession of the goods, namely—
/->-(b) in a case where the parties to the contract intend that the seller should transfer only such title as a third person may have, that person;
/->-(c) anyone claiming through or under the seller or that third person otherwise than under a charge or encumbrance disclosed or known to the buyer before the contract is made.
/->-b>[ (5A) As regards England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the term implied by subsection (1) above is a condition and the terms implied by subsections (2), (4) and (5) above are warranties.]</b
/->-6) Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 below applies in relation to a contract made before 18 May 1973.
/->-7) This section does not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in section 17 of that Act).
/->-b>(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied [term] that the goods will correspond with the description.</b
/->-b>[ (1A)As regards England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the term implied by subsection (1) above is a condition.]</b
/->-(2) If the sale is by sample as well as by description it is not sufficient that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample if the goods do not also correspond with the description.
/->-(3) A sale of goods is not prevented from being a sale by description by reason only that, being exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the buyer.
/->-(4) Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 below applies in relation to a contract made before 18 May 1973.
/->-(5) This section does not apply to a contract to which Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies (but see the provision made about such contracts in section 11 of that Act).
/->-(1)Except as provided by this section and section 15 below and subject to any other enactment, there is no implied [term] about the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale.
/->-b>[ (2) Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is an implied term that the goods supplied under the contract are of satisfactory quality.</b
/->-(2A) For the purposes of this Act, goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances.
/->-(2B)For the purposes of this Act, the quality of goods includes their state and condition and the following (among others) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of goods—
/->-(a) fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied,
/->-(2C) The term implied by subsection (2) above does not extend to any matter making the quality of goods unsatisfactory—
/->-(a) which is specifically drawn to the buyer's attention before the contract is made,
/->-(b) where the buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, which that examination ought to reveal, or
/->-(c) in the case of a contract for sale by sample, which would have been apparent on a reasonable examination of the sample.]
/->-(3) Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business and the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known—
/->-(b) where the purchase price or part of it is payable by instalments and the goods were previously sold by a credit-broker to the seller, to that credit-broker,
/->-any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought, there is an implied [term] that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are commonly supplied, except where the circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him to rely, on the skill or judgment of the seller or credit-broker.
/->-(4) An implied [term] about quality or fitness for a particular purpose may be annexed to a contract of sale by usage.
/->-(5) The preceding provisions of this section apply to a sale by a person who in the course of a business is acting as agent for another as they apply to a sale by a principal in the course of a business, except where that other is not selling in the course of a business and either the buyer knows that fact or reasonable steps are taken to bring it to the notice of the buyer before the contract is made.
/->-b>[ (6) As regards England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the terms implied by subsections (2) and (3) above are conditions.]</b

SUMMARY ~*Comments*~
/->-Section 6: This section will need attention at a later stage, in connection with a short line of cases on mistake (<i>Couturier v Hastie</i> (1856) and <i>McRae v Commonwealth Disposals</i> (1951)).
/->-Section 11: This section ratifies some of the common law rules on conditions and warranties, and was one of the grounds upon which it was sometimes thought that these two categories of term were the only available ones.
/->-Section 12: With section 12, the main cycle of implied terms begins. It continues through sections 13, 14 and 15, imposing implied conditions as to good title, description, quality and correspondence with sample on non-consumer contracts for the sale of goods. The reason for the initial statement of a “term” and its later specification as a “condition”, is that the Act applies in Scotland as well as England, Wales and Northern Ireland; its structure, and the use of square brackets around certain words or sections, are indications that the text diverges at these points into a local version for each jurisdiction.
/->-Section 15A: This new section was introduced by the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994. It addresses a problem inherent in the condition/warranty dichotomy which governs this part of the Sale of Goods Act. Since breach of a condition entitles the wronged party to opt for termination of the contract, even though he may have suffered no damage as a result of the breach, there were several cases prior to 1994 in which parties did exactly that in order to escape a bad bargain (see, for example, <i>Moore v Landauer</i> (1921)). The new section puts a stop to this practice. Its introduction creates a necessary elasticity in the scheme of remedies under the Act, comparable to the effect of the innominate term analysis in broader commercial law.
/->-This Act takes the structure and content of the main run of implied terms in the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (sections 12 – 15A), and applies them with virtually no modifications to contracts for the <b>transfer of property in goods</b>, and contracts for the <b>hire of goods</b>. Like the Sale of Goods Act, the 1982 Act no longer applies to consumer contracts, which are now governed by the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Changes made by that Act are printed below in italics.
/->-It is not always easy to determine whether a contract is one for the sale of goods or for the supply of goods and services. Perhaps surprisingly, the boundary between the two types of contract is not rigorously established. Chapter 2 of Atiyah, Adams and MacQueen's <i>The Sale of Goods</i> deals exhaustively with this topic. Often, little will turn on which side of the boundary a case is put, since the provisions on either side of the divide are so similar.
/->-Contracts for the <b>supply of a service</b> are dealt with completely separately. Since this part of the 1982 Act includes one implied term of immense importance relating to care and skill, and two more which deserve to be learnt, it is reproduced here in full (sections 13-15).
/->-(1) In this Act a “relevant contract for the supply of a service” means, subject to subsection (2) below, a contract under which a person (“the supplier”) agrees to carry out a service<i>, other than one to which Chapter 4 of Part 1 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 applies.
/->-(2) For the purposes of this Act, a contract of service or apprenticeship is not a contract for the supply of a service.
/->-(3) Subject to subsection (2) above, a contract is a contract for the supply of a service for the purposes of this Act whether or not goods are also—
/->-under the contract, and whatever is the nature of the consideration for which the service is to be carried out.
/->-(4) The Secretary of State may by order provide that one or more of sections 13 to 15 below shall not apply to services of a description specified in the order, and such an order may make different provision for different circumstances.
/->-(5) The power to make an order under subsection (4) above shall be exercisable by statutory instrument subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament. 
/->-b>In a <i>relevant</i> contract for the supply of a service where the supplier is acting in the course of a business, there is an implied term that the supplier will carry out the service with reasonable care and skill.</b
/->-b>(1) Where, under a <i>relevant</i> contract for the supply of a service by a supplier acting in the course of a business, the time for the service to be carried out is not fixed by the contract, left to be fixed in a manner agreed by the contract or determined by the course of dealing between the parties, there is an implied term that the supplier will carry out the service within a reasonable time.</b
/->-b>(1) Where, under a <i>relevant</i> contract for the supply of a service, the consideration for the service is not determined by the contract, left to be determined in a manner agreed by the contract or determined by the course of dealing between the parties, there is an implied term that the party contracting with the supplier will pay a reasonable charge.</b
/->-(1)Where a right, duty or liability would arise under a <i>relevant</i> contract for the supply of a service by virtue of this Part of this Act, it may (subject to subsection (2) below and the 1977 Act) be negatived or varied by express agreement, or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by such usage as binds both parties to the contract.
/->-(2 )An express term does not negative a term implied by this Part of this Act unless inconsistent with it.
/->-(a) any rule of law which imposes on the supplier a duty stricter than that imposed by section 13 or 14 above; or
/->-(b) subject to paragraph (a) above, any rule of law whereby any term not inconsistent with this Part of this Act is to be implied in a contract for the supply of a service.
/->-(4) This Part of this Act has effect subject to any other enactment which defines or restricts the rights, duties or liabilities arising in connection with a service of any description.

SUMMARY ~*Comments.*~
/->-The implied terms in sections 13 – 15 are not defined by the 1982 Act in the same way that those in the main run of implied terms are specified to be either conditions or warranties. It is probable that the terms in sections 13 and 14 are in fact innominate. Section 15 seems merely to introduce a mechanism into contracts which would not give rise to the sequence of breach and remedy, and therefore does not require further definition.
/->-This long and complex piece of legislation, brought into force on 1 October 2015, has produced the most significant overhaul of consumer law in decades. It governs contracts for goods and for services between traders and consumers, to which the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 have now ceased to apply. The rights and protections which were formerly derived from them are re-enacted in a more sophisticated form, with a tiered system of remedies. The Act also deals comprehensively with contracts for the supply of digital content.
/->-The Act has also taken over the functions of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 with regard to consumer contracts. This will be further discussed in the next lecture, which deals with the control of exemption clauses.
/->-The main terms implied by the Act into contracts for the sale or supply of goods are that they should:
/->-· Be fit for a particular purpose (if such a purpose was expressly or impliedly made known) (s. 10);
/->-Broadly similar provisions in Chapter 3 of the Act cover the supply of digital content.
/->-b>The scheme of remedies</b> (this is complex, and only a schematic introduction is given here).
/->-The consumer has the right to reject and receive a full refund. This right terminates after 30 days (sooner if the goods are perishable).
/->-This right also arises on transfer of ownership or delivery, but continues beyond the 30 day period.
/->-b>Tier 3</b> – rejection and refund, or retention and price reduction
/->-This right exists for 6 months from transfer of ownership or delivery, but can be claimed only after the second tier remedy has been exercised, or proved impossible.
/->-Chapter 4 of the 2015 Act governs contracts for the supply of services. At its core are provisions similar to those of the equivalent part of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, including the requirement that a service must be performed with reasonable care and skill (s.49). S.54 sets out the rights which arise upon breach. These include the right to repeat performance and the right to a price reduction, while the availability of other contractual remedies is preserved (short of double recovery, of course). The s.49 provision as to reasonable care and skill cannot be excluded.
/->-The key provision determining the applicability of the Act is given in s.2, where “trader” is defined as “a person acting for purposes relating to that person's trade, business, craft or profession”, and “consumer” is defined as “an individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individual's trade, business, craft or profession”.
