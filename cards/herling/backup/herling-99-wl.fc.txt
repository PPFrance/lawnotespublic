SUMMARY as to subject matter
SUMMARY At the present day, since the fusion of law and equity, the position appears to be that when the parties to a contract are to all outward appearances in full and certain agreement, neither of them can set up his own mistake, or the mistake of both of them, so as to make the contract a nullity from the beginning. Even a common mistake as to the subject-matter is good unless and until it is set aside for failure of some condition on which the existence of the contract depends, or for fraud, or on some equitable ground.

SUMMARY Poisons; sale by or under supervision of registered pharmacist
SUMMARY Where goods are displayed in a shop and it is intended that customers shall go and choose what they want, the contract is not completed until the customer has indicated the article which he needs and the shopkeeper or someone on his behalf accepts that offer, and it makes no difference that the shop is a "self-service" shop. The defendants had adopted a "self-service" system in their shop, which consisted in allowing persons who resorted to the shop to go to shelves where goods were exposed for sale and marked with the price. They took the article required and went to the cash desk, where the cashier or assistant saw the article, stated the price, and took the money. In one of their departments there were on certain shelves ointments and drugs coming within Part I of the Poisons List. Before any person could leave with what he had bought in that department he had to pass the scrutiny and supervision of a qualified pharmacist. The question for the opinion of the court was whether each sale was effected in accordance with the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933 s.18(1)(a)(iii) which provides that the sale of any poison included in Part I of the Poisons List shall not be lawful unless "the sale is effected by, or under the supervision of, a registered pharmacist."
HELD a sale was not completed until the customer's offer to buy had been accepted by the defendants by their acceptance of the purchase price, which acceptance took place under the supervision of a registered pharmacist as required by the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933 s.18(1)(a)(iii) .

SUMMARY Exemption clause; automatic ticket machine; whether conditions noticeable
SUMMARY A customer, who receives from an automatic machine a ticket stated to be issued subject to conditions, is only bound by them if reasonably sufficient steps have been taken to bring them to his notice. Per curiam: The nature of the intended exemption is a factor to be taken into account in deciding as to the reasonableness of what has been done to bring it to the other party's notice. T drove his car into a new automatic car park where he had never been before. A notice outside gave the charges and stated that all cars were "parked at owner's risk." A traffic light on the entrance lane showed red and a machine produced a ticket when the car stopped beside it. T took this and, the light having turned green, drove into the garage where the car was parked. On returning to collect it there was an accident in which he was injured. In his action against the garage for damages the garage contended inter alia that the ticket incorporated a condition exempting them from liability. The ticket stated the car's time of arrival and that it was to be presented when the car was claimed. In the bottom left-hand corner in small print it was said to be "issued subject to conditions . . . displayed on the premises." On a pillar opposite the ticket machine were displayed eight lengthy conditions, one of which stated that the garage owners were not responsible for injury to a customer. On appeal by the garage against the award of damages to T, held, dismissing the appeal, that, since T did not know of the exemption condition and the garage had not done what was reasonably sufficient to bring it to his notice, it did not exempt them from liability.

ABSTRACT The appellant company (B) appealed against a decision that it was liable for a claim for damages brought by the respondent (C).
ABSTRACT B was the manufacturer of a medical preparation called the carbolic smoke ball, which was designed to prevent the user from contracting flu. B placed an advertisement in newspapers which stated that a reward of £100 would be paid to anyone who contracted flu or a cold after using the smoke ball three times per day for two weeks according to the directions supplied with each ball. The advertisement further stated that B had deposited £1,000 with a named bank to show the sincerity of its offer. C purchased a ball in reliance on B's advert and used it as directed but contracted flu whilst using it.
ABSTRACT B argued that its advertisement did not amount to a contractually binding promise as it was addressed to the world in general, it was too vague, and was not limited by time. B further argued that if the advert was an offer, C had not communicated her intention to accept it.
SUMMARY An advertisement amounted to an offer to the world which could be accepted by anyone who performed the conditions set out in it. The claimant did not have to notify the advertiser of her intention to accept the offer prior to her performance of the conditions.
HELD Appeal dismissed.
HELD (1) The advertisement stated that £1,000 was lodged at a bank. Therefore it could not be said that the statement that £100 would be paid was intended to be mere puff. It was an offer made to all the world, but there was no reason why an offer should not be made to all the world which was to ripen into a contract when anyone came forward and performed the condition required, Spencer v Harding (1869-70) L.R. 5 C.P. 561 considered. (2) Generally, when an offer was made, in order to make a binding contract it was necessary not only that it was accepted but that the acceptance was notified. However, the instant case was an exception to that rule; the notification of acceptance did not have to precede the performance. The person who made the offer could dispense with notice if he thought it desirable to do so. B had shown by its language and from the nature of the transaction that it did not expect and did not require notice of acceptance, apart from notice of the performance. Anyone who performed the conditions set out in the advertisement had accepted the offer, Williams v Carwardine 110 E.R. 590 and Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Co (1877) 2 App. Cas. 666 applied. The advertisement therefore contained all of the necessary elements to form a binding contract enforceable in law, save for two potential problems: firstly, it was not limited by time, and secondly the question of consideration. (3) A reasonable person would not understand B's advertisement to mean that if a person used a smoke ball three times daily for two weeks they were guaranteed against contracting flu for the rest of their life. There were a number of reasonable constructions to be put on the advertisement but the preferred construction was that the reward was offered to any person who contracted flu in the current epidemic within a reasonable time after having used the smoke ball, or whilst using the ball. (4) A use by the public of the smoke ball as a result of the advertisement was directly beneficial to B. Therefore, B received an advantage which was enough to constitute a consideration. In addition, inconvenience sustained by one party at the request of the other was enough to create a consideration, Gerhard v Bates 118 E.R. 845 considered. The person who acted upon the advertisement put himself to some inconvenience at B's request. That was ample consideration for B's promise.

SUMMARY Specific performance; contract to sell council house; whether enforceable; correspondence and conduct of parties
SUMMARY In deciding whether the parties have reached a binding agreement, the court should look at the correspondence between the parties as a whole and at the conduct of the parties to see if they have agreed on all material terms. G was the tenant and occupier of a council house owned by M Corp, by whom he had been employed for 16 years. In November 1970, M Corp sent G a form and a brochure giving details of how he could buy the house. G completed the form and returned it, requesting information as to its price. In February 1971, M Corp wrote informing G of the price, and saying that if he wished to purchase the house, he should return the enclosed application. G completed the form, leaving the price blank, and returned it with a covering letter asking for consideration to be given to defects in the path to the house. M Corp replied that the price had been fixed according to the condition of the property. G wrote back asking the corporation to "carry on with the purchase as per my application." M Corp took the house off the list of tenant-occupied houses and G did some work on the house. The political control of M Corp changed and they resolved not to sell council houses except where legally binding contracts had been previously concluded. G was notified that the sale would not proceed. On G's claim, the county court judge found that the contract for sale was complete and ordered specific performance. On appeal by M Corp, held, dismissing the appeal (Geoffrey Lane L.J. dissenting), that in the light of the correspondence as a whole, and the conduct of the parties, there was a concluded agreement for the sale of the house.

SUMMARY H, an auctioneer, appealed the grant of judgment to a bidder, B, following H's withdrawal of items from an auction without reserve. H contended that an auction without reserve did not create an obligation to sell to the highest bidder, alternatively that there was no consideration for the auctioneer's promise and finally, that as an agent for a disclosed principal, the auctioneer could not be held liable in contract. The court held that (1) there was a contract to sell to the highest bidder and a failure to do so amounted to a breach; (2) the detriment to the bidder arising from the fact that his bid could be accepted unless withdrawn and benefit to the auctioneer arising from the fact that the sale price was driven up by the bid, was adequate consideration, and (3) although the contract of sale existed between vendor and purchaser, a collateral agreement existed between H and B.
SUMMARY H, a firm of auctioneers, appealed against a judgment requiring it to pay B, a bidder, a sum of GBP 27,600, following H's withdrawal of items from an auction without reserve. B had bid GBP 200 for each of two engine analysers, being auctioned without reserve, which were worth GBP 14,000. H's agent refused to sell the machines on the ground that the bid was too low and the machines were sold a few days later. B claimed damages on the basis that he was the highest bidder. H contended that (1) an auction without reserve did not create an obligation to sell to the highest bidder; (2) there was no consideration for the auctioneer's promise, and (3) as an agent for a disclosed principal, the auctioneer could not be held liable in contract.
HELD dismissing the appeal, that (1) the highest bidder at an auction without reserve could not be rejected simply because the bid was too low, Warlow v Harrison 120 E.R. 920 followed. The auctioneer was obliged, by virtue of a collateral warranty, to sell to the highest bidder and a failure to do so amounted to a breach; (2) the detriment to the bidder arising from the fact that his bid could be accepted unless withdrawn and the benefit to the auctioneer arising from the fact that the sale price was driven up by the bid, was adequate consideration, and (3) although the contract of sale existed between vendor and purchaser, a collateral agreement existed between H and B. Where the seller refused to continue with the sale, the measure of damages was to be determined with reference to the difference between the contract price and the current market value of the goods by virtue of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s.51(3).

CATEGORY Contracts; Offer and Acceptance; Share Sales; Tender Offers
FLAGS Approved
SUMMARY Formation; offer and acceptance; sealed tender; referential bid
SUMMARY Where sellers indicate that they wish to accept the highest offer and that the offers are to remain confidential, this is only consistent with a presumed intention to create a fixed bid sale, and not an auction sale where one bidder's bid can be adjusted by reference to another. D1, a Jersey trust company, was the registered holder of shares in a company in which the plaintiff company and D2 and his family owned shares. Whichever of the two groups acquired the trustees' shares would acquire control of the company. The trustees by telex invited P and D2 to make offers by sealed tender or confidential telex for the shares by 3 p.m. on September 16, 1981. The offers were to be confidential until that time, and were to be a single offer for all the shares. In the event of closing not taking place within 30 days "other than by reason of delay on the trustees' part" interest should be payable by the purchaser on the purchase price and the trustees agreed to accept the highest offer. P's offer was CUSD 2,175,000 and D2's CUSD 2,100,000 or CUSD 101,000 in excess of any other offer expressed as a fixed monetary amount, whichever is the higher. Calculated by reference to P's offer, D2's alternative offer (the referential bid) was CUSD 2,276,000. D1 accepted D2's offer but P obtained an injunction preventing them doing so. The judge gave judgment for P on their claim for the shares and held that they were not liable to pay interest. The Court of Appeal allowed D2's appeal. P's appeal to the House of Lords was allowed.
HELD that whether D1 had invited P and D2 to take part in a fixed bid or an auction sale (where the price could be adjusted by reference to the other bid) depended upon their presumed intention, which was deduced from the terms of the invitation read as a whole. Their undertaking to accept the highest offer, the fact that the same invitation had been given to both, and their insistence on confidentiality showed that they wished to obtain the best price on a fixed bidding scale. The use of the word "offer" did not displace that presumed intention. D2 had not been entitled to submit or D1 to accept a referential bid ( South Hetton Coal Co v Haswell Shotton and Easington Coal and Coke Co [1898] 1 Ch. 465 approved; SSI Investors Ltd v Korea Tungsten Mining Co Ltd 449 N.Y.S.2d 173 applied). Although D1's conduct in declining to complete with P was not blameworthy, since they thought mistakenly that they were under an obligation to accept D2's referential bid, the failure to complete had been due to delay on their part within the meaning of the invitation and so they were not entitled to interest at the contractual penal rate imposed by the invitation. However P should not, in all the circumstances, have the benefit of the interest attributable to the purchase money as well as the profits attributable to the shares since October 15, 1981, and accordingly, as a condition of being granted specific performance, they should be required to pay interest to D1 on the purchase price of GBP 2,175,000 from that date until actual payment at the short term interest rate.

SUMMARY Bailment for reward; duty of bailee to safeguard property
SUMMARY The plaintiffs, carriers, transported by road a lorry load of whisky and delivered it to the defendants' warehouse for safe keeping overnight. In the warehouse the whisky (worth some GBP 9,000) was unloaded and placed on a trailer hitched to a tractor unit ready to be further transported the next morning. It stood in full view of passers-by. At night the warehouse was guarded by a mobile security officer who normally visited the warehouse four times nightly and for whose services the defendants contracted with the third parties. On the night in question, however, the security officer visited the warehouse three times only, his last visit finishing at 2.18 a.m. His fourth visit, if he had made it, would have been at about 5 a.m. At a time probably not long after the security officer's third visit thieves broke into the warehouse and stole the whisky. The plaintiffs compensated the owners of the whisky in full and then sued the defendants for damages for negligence, the security officer's employer company being joined as third parties.
HELD (1) that the defendant's system of protection was not adequate in the circumstances and the defendants had failed to prove that the loss was not due to their negligence; (2) that the defendants, therefore, were liable in damages to the plaintiffs; (3) that the defendant's liability was limited to GBP 800 per ton, the defendants' conditions of carriage being incorporated in the contract; and (4) that the judge's finding that the third parties had been negligent, but that this negligence had not caused loss, would not be disturbed. Per curiam: apart from their original liability under (1) above, the defendants were liable for any negligence of the third parties. (Decision of Cairns J.

SUMMARY Offer and acceptance; order to be accepted on sellers' terms; acknowledgment of order on buyers' terms
SUMMARY Where parties to a contract have made offer and counter-offer, the documents passing between the parties must be construed as a whole, but the rules set out in Hyde v Wrench 49 E.R. 132 still apply. The plaintiff sellers offered to deliver a machine tool on condition that orders were only to be accepted on the terms set out in the quotation. The sellers' terms included a price variation clause. The defendant buyers replied with an order containing different terms and no price variation clause. The order had a tear-off slip of acknowledgment on those terms, which acknowledgment was duly signed by the sellers. Due to the buyers' delay in accepting delivery the sellers invoked the price variation clause. The sellers were successful at first instance but on appeal, held, allowing the appeal, that the buyers' reply was a counter offer which the sellers had accepted by their acknowledgment (Hyde v Wrench 49 E.R. 132 applied and Trollope & Colls Ltd (t/a Nuclear Civil Constructions) v Atomic Power Constructions Ltd [1963] 1 W.L.R. 333 applied).

ABSTRACT The appellant seller (S) appealed against a decision that the parties' dealings were on the terms of the respondent buyer (B).
ABSTRACT The parties were part of a chain of suppliers to Rolls Royce as ultimate purchaser. Rolls Royce needed engine control systems for installation in its aero engines. It bought such systems from Goodrich which itself bought cable assembly items such as cable harnesses for internal wiring from B. In order to manufacture the harnesses B acquired connectors from S. The parties had been doing business for over 20 years. For most, if not all, of that time the supply of connectors had been controlled by Goodrich which required B to purchase the connectors from S to a specification required by Goodrich and at a price determined by Goodrich. S had also had a long term contract with Goodrich pursuant to which it agreed to supply connectors to B for the price determined by Goodrich. B sent purchase orders to S containing B's own terms and conditions. S acknowledged the purchase orders by sending an acknowledgment which stated that S's own terms and conditions applied. Although an offer to buy on the purchaser's terms which was followed by an acknowledgement of purchase on the seller's terms and then delivery would normally result in a contract on the seller's terms, the judge held that B's terms applied because it was never intended that S's terms should apply and the parties had always intended that B's terms were to apply.
ABSTRACT S submitted that the judge should not have analysed the overall relationship between the parties and come to the conclusion which he did, but should have applied the traditional offer and acceptance analysis resulting in a contract on S's terms.
SUMMARY A judge had erred in not applying a traditional offer and acceptance analysis to determine which of the parties' terms and conditions applied to the contracts between them.
HELD Appeal allowed.
HELD The traditional offer and acceptance analysis had to be adopted unless the documents passing between the parties and their conduct showed that their common intention was that some other terms were intended to prevail, Butler Machine Tool Co v Ex-cell-o Corp (England) [1979] 1 W.L.R. 401 considered. The traditional analysis would conclude that the terms on S's acknowledgment would be the terms on which the parties contracted. The judge gave weight to the fact that the connectors were items of considerable sophistication which were to be fitted into aero engine control systems so that delivery times and quality control were important; the pre-existing agreement between S and Goodrich which committed S to make supplies on terms which largely corresponded to those of B; and the fact that S did not mention its own terms before the service of the defence. The context of the parties' relationship was important but the factors on which the judge relied did not justify his conclusion. The fact that delivery times and quality control were essential was true in many commercial relationships and could be no more than a background factor. There was no precise matching between the terms of the agreement between S and Goodrich and B's terms. The parties had had an opportunity to agree a single set of terms but did not do so. The terms of the post-dispute correspondence were not as significant as the judge thought. It could not be inferred from the correspondence that S's never intended its terms and conditions to apply. Although the context of a long term relationship and the conduct of the parties might be strong enough to displace the result which a traditional offer and acceptance analysis would dictate, the circumstances were not strong enough to do so in the instant case. The judge should have held that S's terms and conditions applied.

He applied unsuccessfully to the Secretary of State for facilities to be arranged for him to marry a girl at a local registry office, claiming that the marriage had been arranged by the respective families and that the arrangement had only come to his knowledge after his arrest in April 1975. He claimed that Art.12 of the European Convention on Human Rights conferred on him an inalienable right to marry. The Divisional Court having refused an application for mandamus, he appealed.
HELD dismissing the appeal, that the right to marry given in Art.12(1) could be restricted by the circumstances and in particular by the circumstance of the appellant being lawfully detained under Art.5(1)(f); the Secretary of State was entitled to refuse to facilitate the marriage.

ABSTRACT The claimants, residents of the Broads, applied for judicial review of a resolution by the defendant to re-brand the area as "The Broads National Park" for the purposes of attracting tourists.
ABSTRACT The Broads was not designated as a National Park under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, nor was the defendant a National Park Authority. It was constituted under the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988, which imposed various duties upon it for the management of the Broads. However, the area had been treated for many years as forming part of the "family" of National Parks. It was common ground that the defendant had not sought to re-brand itself or describe itself as a National Park Authority. By its resolution it purported only to re-brand the area known as "the Broads" by describing it as "The Broads National Park". The claimants' main concern was to ensure that the biodiversity and environmental value of the Broads was conserved, either by it fully becoming a National Park or, at the very least confirming its application of the "Sandford Principle", encapsulated in s.11A(2) of the 1949 Act, which required National Parks to put the preservation and natural beauty of such areas before the promotion of public enjoyment where there was a conflict between the two.
ABSTRACT The issue was whether a public body which was not a National Park could represent itself as a National Park, and enjoy the benefits of such a status without being subject to the legal duties imposed upon National Parks.
ABSTRACT The claimants submitted that the defendant's resolution was:
ABSTRACT (1) irrational and invalid because it was outside the scope of the Local Government Act 1972 s.111, and because it attributed to the Broads a statutory term which could only be employed for areas statutorily designated as National Parks under the 1949 Act;
ABSTRACT (2) misleading as to the scope of the defendant's statutory functions because it led the public into thinking that the Sandford Principle was applicable within the Broads when it was not;
ABSTRACT (3) procedurally unfair because it involved a decision not to pursue the long term vision of the Broads Plan 2011 to become a National Park (and thereby adopt the Sandford Principle) without any consultation on that point.
ABSTRACT 
SUMMARY The Broads Authority had been entitled to re-brand "the Broads" as "the Broads National Park" without changing the legal status of the area and without becoming subject to the legal duties imposed upon National Parks by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949.
HELD Application refused.
HELD (1) The Broads shared many of the statutory characteristics of a National Park, as was evident from the 1949 and 1988 Acts, and from the fact that a circular issued to National Parks by the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was said to apply equally to the Broads on account of its similarities with National Parks. The defendant's resolution did not breach the legislation because it did not seek to treat the Broads as a National Park, only to adopt the name for marketing purposes. The code contained in the 1949 Act was not specifically directed to the use of a brand name for a National Park. By virtue of the Local Government Act 1972 s.144 and s.265A, the defendant was empowered to encourage persons to visit the Broads for recreation. By s.2(7) of the 1988 Act and s.111 of the 1972 Act it could do anything necessary or expedient for enabling it to carry out its functions. Such functions included "promotion"; which included marketing the Broads to the public. The defendant's objectives in adopting the brand name fell within the ambit of those provisions. Furthermore, it was legally possible to separate the use of "National Park" as a brand name from the legal status of a National Park. The phrase "National Park" had become established as an ordinary part of English language and National Park legislation had no legal monopoly over the use of the term. There was no basis on which to imply a Parliamentary intention to prohibit the use of the term "National Park" outside the code based upon the 1949 Act (see paras 26, 61, 67-69, 73, 75, 77 of judgment).
HELD (2) Whether a statement or decision by a public body had the effect of misleading the public was an objective question; the court's role was not limited to reviewing the decision on Wednesbury principles. The defendant's branding decision had not had a misleading effect with regard to the Sandford Principle, and was not irrational. Even within a National Park, conservation did not have to be the uppermost consideration. Section 11A(2) of the 1949 Act only required the relevant authority to "have regard" to the twin purposes. It did not deal with all relevant considerations such as the need for development. The claimants' reliance upon the Sandford Principle as the key difference between the Broads and National Parks was unsustainable. Introducing the Sandford Principle into the Broads would involve amending legislation, and such amendments could not be contemplated without Parliament considering a number of matters. As the defendant was only adopting a brand name, and the legal regime within the Broads remained unaltered, the resolution was only concerned with how the Broads should be marketed. In order to make a lawful name choice, it had not been necessary for the defendant to decide about the introduction of the Sandford Principle (paras 6, 81-82, 85, 87, 91-92, 95, 97).
HELD (3) The 2011 Plan did not seek to promote the adoption of the Sandford Principle. For that reason and others, the claimants' submissions regarding defective consultation failed (paras 104-112).

ABSTRACT The claimant shipowner claimed under guarantees given by the defendant guarantor in respect of three charterparties.
ABSTRACT The shipowner owned three vessels which it had let on long-term NYPE 1993 charterparties to the charterer, a subsidiary of the guarantor. After a year, the charterer fell into arrears in payment of hire. The shipowner withdrew the vessels, terminated the charterparties and began arbitration proceedings against the charterer. Those proceedings were stayed when the charterer went into liquidation. The shipowner began the instant proceedings against the guarantor, claiming the balance due under the charters, damages for loss of bargain in respect of the unexpired terms, and the costs of the arbitration proceedings. The guarantor asserted that it was not bound by the guarantees because they had been signed, without authority, by its executive board chairman (J), and because they had not been registered by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). Alternatively, it claimed that it was not liable in respect of the unexpired periods because the right of withdrawal was a contractual option and there had been no repudiatory breach or renunciation. The central issues were (i) whether the guarantor was bound by the guarantees; (ii) whether payment of hire was a condition of the charterparties; (iii) if not, whether the charterer had repudiated or renounced the charterparties; (iv) the correct method of assessing damages where there was no market for a replacement time charter for the duration of the unexpired term; (v) whether the arbitration costs fell within the scope of the guarantees.
SUMMARY Payment of hire by the charterers was not a condition of NYPE 1993 charterparties. In so deciding, the Commercial Court declined to follow the decision in Kuwait Rocks Co v AMN Bulkcarriers Inc [2013] EWHC 865 (Comm), [2013] 2 All E.R. (Comm) 689 (The Astra).
HELD Judgment for claimant.
HELD (1) J had had actual authority to bind the guarantor. Actual authority was governed by Chinese law and was established if the guarantor had expressly authorised J to sign the guarantees, had known that he was signing but had done nothing to repudiate his assertion of authority, or if J had been performing a duty-related activity in signing. The evidence showed that all those conditions were established. In any event, J had had ostensible authority, or the guarantor had ratified the guarantees by adopting them. The SAFE provisions were not applicable, Emeraldian Ltd Partnership v Wellmix Shipping Ltd (The Vine) [2010] EWHC 1411 (Comm), [2011] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 301 applied (see paras 67-70, 78-91 of judgment). (2) The authorities were divided as to whether the payment of hire was a condition. Faced with the conflicting decisions of Tenax Steamship Co v Owners of the Motor Vessel Brimnes (The Brimnes) [1973] 1 W.L.R. 386 and Kuwait Rocks Co v AMN Bulkcarriers Inc [2013] EWHC 865 (Comm), [2013] 2 All E.R. (Comm) 689 (The Astra), the instant court followed the former, The Brimnes applied, The Astra not applied. In the absence of clear language, a contractual termination clause was to be treated as an option to cancel which did not confer greater rights to damages at common law than would otherwise exist, Financings Ltd v Baldock [1963] 2 Q.B. 104 followed. There was no such clear language in the instant charterparties, and so the withdrawal clause did not make payment of hire a condition. Nor would payment of hire be treated as a condition without the withdrawal clause. First, providing for an express right of withdrawal for non-payment suggested that, without such provision, there would be no such right. Second, there was a presumption in mercantile contracts that stipulations as to the time of payment were not conditions unless indicated in the contract. Third, breaches might range from the trivial to the serious, which pointed towards the withdrawal term being innominate, Bunge Corp v Tradax Export SA [1981] 1 W.L.R. 711 considered and Federal Commerce & Navigation Co Ltd v Molena Alpha Inc (The Nanfri) [1979] A.C. 757 followed. Fourth, it could not have been intended that, without express agreement, fractionally late payment would entitle the owners to terminate the charter. Considerations of commercial certainty did not point to a different conclusion. Until The Astra , shipowners and charterers had operated on the footing that the payment of hire was not a condition, and the standard forms of time charter had not been altered to indicate that it was. Insofar as the dicta in A/S Tankexpress v Compagnie Financiere Belge des Petroles SA [1949] A.C. 76, Bunge , and Afovos Shipping Co SA v R Pagnan & Fratelli (The Afovos) [1983] 1 W.L.R. 195 stated that payment of hire was a condition, they had not been made after argument and were counterbalanced by The Brimnes ; The Petrofina, Bunge and The Afovos considered (paras 92-95, 188-207). (3) The charterer had renounced the charterparties. Conduct falling short of repudiation might amount to renunciation if a reasonable observer would conclude that the charterer intended not to perform so as to deprive the shipowner of substantially its whole benefit (paras 208-212). (4) Where a charterer repudiated a time charter and, at the date of termination, there was an available market in which to let the vessel on for the full length of the unexpired term on materially equivalent terms save as to hire, damages were assessed by reference to the difference between the charterparty rate and the rate for the substitute charter. Where there was no such available market, the owner had to mitigate his loss by employing the vessel in a different way, and his loss was the difference between his actual earnings and what he would have earned under the original charterparty, Zodiac Maritime Agencies Ltd v Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (The Kildare) [2010] EWHC 903 (Comm), [2011] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 360 and Glory Wealth Shipping Pte Ltd v Korea Line Corp (The Wren) [2011] EWHC 1819 (Comm), [2012] 1 All E.R. (Comm) 402 applied. The availability of shorter charters did not constitute an available market (paras 216-227). (5) The arbitration costs fell within the scope of the guarantees. They were losses incurred "as a result or arising out of" the charterer's default within the meaning of the guarantees (paras 241-246).

SUMMARY Licence; lease or; tenancy at will
SUMMARY "It is of the essence of a tenancy at will that it should be determinable by either party on demand." "The difference between a tenancy and a licence is, therefore, that in a tenancy an interest passes in the land, whereas in a licence it does not. . . . Although a person who is let into exclusive possession is, prima facie, to be considered to be a tenant, nevertheless he will not be held to be so if the circumstances negative any intention to create a tenancy. Words alone may not suffice. Parties cannot turn a tenancy into a licence merely by calling it one. But if the circumstances and the conduct of the parties show that all that was intended was that the occupier should be granted a personal privilege with no interest in the land, he will be held only to be a licensee": per Denning, L.J. In 1936 a father bought a house for his son and daughter-in-law to live in. The father put down GBP 250 in cash and borrowed GBP 500 from a building society on the security of the house, repayable with interest by instalments of 15s. a week. He took the house in his own name and made himself responsible for the instalments. The father told the daughter-in-law that the GBP 250 was a present for them, but he left them to pay the building society instalments of 15s. a week themselves. He handed the building society book to the daughter-in-law and said to her: "Don't part with this book. The house will be your property when the mortgage is paid." He said that when he retired he would transfer it into their names. The daughter-in-law paid the instalments regularly from that date onwards with the result that much of the mortgage had been repaid. The father, on being informed that the couple could not pay the rates, paid those also. In 1945 the father died leaving the house to his widow. Soon after, the son left his wife. The widow sued her daughter-in-law for possession of the house. Held, (1) there was no tenancy at will as the father could not revoke his promise once the couple entered on performance of the act: his promise would only cease to bind him if they left it incomplete and unperformed, which they had not done; (2) the 15s. which the couple paid was not rent as they were not bound to pay it: the father could not sue for it or distrain for it; he could only refuse to transfer the house to them; (3) the couple were licensees, having a permissive occupation short of a tenancy, but with a contractual right or, at any rate, an equitable right to remain so long as they paid the instalments, which would grow into a good equitable title to the house itself as soon as the mortgage was paid.

SUMMARY Sale of land; whether contract existed; requirement of writing; enforceability
SUMMARY A contract to do something which has the effect of disposing of an interest in land is a contract to dispose of an interest in land within s.40 of the Act. D Ltd negotiated with F Ltd for the sale of certain properties. D Ltd alleged that there was an oral agreement that F Ltd would exchange contracts for the sale of the properties if D Ltd attended at their offices with a draft contract in terms already agreed and a banker's draft for the deposit. D Ltd complied with those conditions, but F Ltd refused to exchange contracts. D Ltd claimed damages for breach of the oral agreements. The judge struck out the statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action in that there was no note or memorandum of the agreement sufficient to satisfy s.40(1) of the Act. D Ltd appealed.
HELD dismissing the appeal, that (1) D Ltd, having satisfied the conditions specified, there was a valid unilateral contract of which F Ltd were in breach; although the unilateral contract was not for the sale of land or an interest in land, s.40 of the Act applied to it and, in the absence of a memorandum in writing, there had to be an act of part performance before it could be enforced; (2) D Ltd's acts did not point to there being some contract so there was no act of part performance to exclude the provisions of s.40(1) of the Act.

ABSTRACT The appellant company (B) appealed against a decision that it was liable for a claim for damages brought by the respondent (C).
ABSTRACT B was the manufacturer of a medical preparation called the carbolic smoke ball, which was designed to prevent the user from contracting flu. B placed an advertisement in newspapers which stated that a reward of £100 would be paid to anyone who contracted flu or a cold after using the smoke ball three times per day for two weeks according to the directions supplied with each ball. The advertisement further stated that B had deposited £1,000 with a named bank to show the sincerity of its offer. C purchased a ball in reliance on B's advert and used it as directed but contracted flu whilst using it.
ABSTRACT B argued that its advertisement did not amount to a contractually binding promise as it was addressed to the world in general, it was too vague, and was not limited by time. B further argued that if the advert was an offer, C had not communicated her intention to accept it.
SUMMARY An advertisement amounted to an offer to the world which could be accepted by anyone who performed the conditions set out in it. The claimant did not have to notify the advertiser of her intention to accept the offer prior to her performance of the conditions.
HELD Appeal dismissed.
HELD (1) The advertisement stated that £1,000 was lodged at a bank. Therefore it could not be said that the statement that £100 would be paid was intended to be mere puff. It was an offer made to all the world, but there was no reason why an offer should not be made to all the world which was to ripen into a contract when anyone came forward and performed the condition required, Spencer v Harding (1869-70) L.R. 5 C.P. 561 considered. (2) Generally, when an offer was made, in order to make a binding contract it was necessary not only that it was accepted but that the acceptance was notified. However, the instant case was an exception to that rule; the notification of acceptance did not have to precede the performance. The person who made the offer could dispense with notice if he thought it desirable to do so. B had shown by its language and from the nature of the transaction that it did not expect and did not require notice of acceptance, apart from notice of the performance. Anyone who performed the conditions set out in the advertisement had accepted the offer, Williams v Carwardine 110 E.R. 590 and Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Co (1877) 2 App. Cas. 666 applied. The advertisement therefore contained all of the necessary elements to form a binding contract enforceable in law, save for two potential problems: firstly, it was not limited by time, and secondly the question of consideration. (3) A reasonable person would not understand B's advertisement to mean that if a person used a smoke ball three times daily for two weeks they were guaranteed against contracting flu for the rest of their life. There were a number of reasonable constructions to be put on the advertisement but the preferred construction was that the reward was offered to any person who contracted flu in the current epidemic within a reasonable time after having used the smoke ball, or whilst using the ball. (4) A use by the public of the smoke ball as a result of the advertisement was directly beneficial to B. Therefore, B received an advantage which was enough to constitute a consideration. In addition, inconvenience sustained by one party at the request of the other was enough to create a consideration, Gerhard v Bates 118 E.R. 845 considered. The person who acted upon the advertisement put himself to some inconvenience at B's request. That was ample consideration for B's promise.

CATEGORY Construction Law Other Related Subjects: Dispute Resolution; Adjudication; Adjudication; Adjudicators' Powers and Duties; Construction Contracts; Enforcement; Jurisdiction
ABSTRACT A claimant applied for summary judgment on its claim to enforce an adjudicator's award.
ABSTRACT The claimant had carried out groundworks for the defendant under a construction contract. There was a dispute between the parties as to how the contract was formed. The claimant's case was that it was formed by the defendant's acceptance of its price breakdown. The defendant had emailed the claimant on 5 December 2014, stating that it would "place the order for the agreed value as attached [in the claimant's breakdown]" and would "raise the letter of intent for this value on Monday". It was the defendant's case that the contract was formed either by the letter of intent, or by the letter of intent plus emails and the placing of a sub-contract order which incorporated a standard form of JCT wording. The defendant had sent the letter of intent on 8 December, but the claimant denied receiving it. Some months later, the defendant sent the sub-contract order to the claimant, specifying various contract terms. The claimant did not sign or return it. However, the claimant later raised a number of issues by email concerning payment, and the defendant asserted that the sub-contract order had been accepted by conduct. Following a payment dispute, an adjudicator found that a pay less notice was invalid as it had not been made in time, and that the full amount claimed was due.
ABSTRACT 
ABSTRACT The claimant submitted that the adjudicator would have acquired jurisdiction by the same procedural route whichever contractual interpretation was preferred, and even if he had misinterpreted the substantive contractual provisions that was no bar to enforcement of his decision.
SUMMARY A claimant's application for summary judgment on a claim to enforce an adjudicator's award was granted, even though there was a dispute concerning the correct terms of the construction contract. The possible difference in substantive outcome that might arise from identifying the contract correctly did not affect the adjudicator's jurisdiction.
HELD Application granted.
HELD (1) It was reasonably arguable that the parties had proceeded on the basis of the promised letter of intent and subsequently on the basis of the letter of intent plus the emails. Under either of those routes, the Scheme for Construction Contracts (England and Wales) Regulations 1998 would have applied, with no specified adjudicator nominating body, so that the procedural route to adjudication would have been the same as if the 5 December 2014 email had formed the basis of the contract. However, there were a number of problems with the letter of intent. It referred to a form of JCT contract which did not exist. While it was clear that something had gone wrong with the language, it was not clear what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant, Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009] UKHL 38, [2009] 1 A.C. 1101 followed. The JCT terms were not incorporated. In addition, no valuation schedule had been attached to the letter of intent, so there was no way of identifying the dates for payment. The mechanism provided by the letter was inoperable and inadequate. The defendant relied on emails to plug the gap left by the failure to provide a valuation schedule. However, even if the letter plus the emails was the proper basis for the parties' contractual obligations, they made payment conditional upon the performance of obligations under the main contract, which was an inadequate mechanism pursuant to the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 s.110. Therefore, the Scheme applied to establish the requisite date for payment and pay less notices. That meant there would have been no substantive difference in the adjudicator's decision on the absence of a valid pay less notice (see paras 12-17, 20, 37 of judgment).
HELD (2) It was also reasonably arguable that the claimant had accepted the sub-contract order by conduct. The Scheme would have applied with no specified nominating body so that the procedural route to adjudication would have been the same as if the December email formed the basis of the contract. It was reasonably arguable that, if operative, the sub-contract order made provision for payment, which meant that the adjudicator's substantive decision was wrong (para.37).
HELD (3) The court therefore had to consider what the position would be if the adjudicator had concluded that he had jurisdiction, but the proper contractual basis of jurisdiction could make a difference to the substantive outcome. The legal policy was that reasonably arguable challenges to an adjudicator's jurisdiction might be a reason for not enforcing a decision, but the mere assertion that he had misunderstood the factual or legal basis for his substantive decision was not, Purton (t/a Richwood Interiors) v Kilker Projects Ltd [2015] EWHC 2624 (TCC), [2015] B.L.R. 754 applied. In the instant case, the adjudicator had jurisdiction because, however the contractual arrangements were correctly to be described, they mandated the use of the Scheme and he was properly appointed by the Scheme's procedure. The possible difference in substantive outcome that could arise from identifying the contract correctly did not go to jurisdiction, but to substantive outcome only. If the adjudicator had made an error of law in referring to the wrong contractual provisions when deciding the substantive question referred to him, that fell within the category of errors of procedure, fact or law, which the Court of Appeal had repeatedly emphasised should not prevent enforcement, Carillion Construction Ltd v Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd [2005] EWHC 778 (TCC), [2005] B.L.R. 310 applied and C&B Scene Concept Design Ltd v Isobars Ltd [2002] EWCA Civ 46, [2002] C.L.C. 652 followed. The claimant was therefore entitled to enforce the award and summary judgment was entered in the claimant's favour (paras 44-45, 52-54).

SUMMARY Quantum meruit; work done in anticipation of contract; no contract concluded
SUMMARY Where one party does work at the request of another in anticipation of a contract, but where on the facts no contract is created, then that party is entitled to payment on a quantum meruit basis. D successfully tendered for the fabrication of steel work in the construction of a building. The parties entered into complicated negotiations and D eventually sent a letter of intent requiring P to commence work on the construction of various items pending contract. P began construction of the items. Further negotiations took place for some time during which P continued to manufacture steel nodes. Eventually negotiations broke down and D refused to make any payment for the nodes. P sued on a quantum meruit basis, D counterclaimed for breach of contract.
HELD that no contract had in fact been made by the letter of intent, nor had an executory contract been created by P acceeding to the request to begin work on the nodes; in the circumstances D were liable to pay a reasonable sum for work done at their request (Hick v Raymond & Reid [1893] A.C. 22 applied).

SUMMARY Consideration; agency; winding up; petition debt disputed; company alleged agreement with Revenue to pay tax arrears in instalments; whether agreement supported by consideration; whether substantial grounds to dispute winding up
SUMMARY The Inland Revenue petitioned for the winding-up of the company, S, on the basis of arrears of tax under the PAYE system. The winding-up order was made and S appealed on the ground that, in October 1991 at a meeting with the Revenue, it was agreed that due to S's cash flow problems the tax due would be paid in arrears. S therefore contended that the petition debt was disputed and the order should be set aside. The issues were whether the tax collector was entitled to accept the instalment proposal, whether there was consideration for the agreement and whether, if there was no agreement, estoppel prevented the Revenue from claiming the debt.
HELD dismissing S's appeal, that (1) the collector of taxes who met with S did not have actual authority to make such an agreement or otherwise bind the Revenue. Further, there was no representation by the Revenue that the tax collector had the Revenue's authority to accept the offered instalment proposal ( Armagas Ltd v Mundogas SA (The Ocean Frost) [1986] A.C. 717 applied); (2) an agreement to pay the arrears of tax in instalments would not have been enforceable because there was no consideration on the part of the Revenue ( Foakes v Beer (1884) 9 App. Cas. 605 applied); (3) as the tax collector had no authority to make the agreement, neither could he make the promise on which the estoppel argument was based; and (4) as S had failed to pay the instalments it was entirely fair of the Revenue to seek to enforce the debt.

ABSTRACT The appellants (D and C) appealed against a decision ([2012] EWHC 1189 (QB), [2012] I.R.L.R. 553) that D had wrongfully denied the respondents, its employees and former employees, their contractual entitlement to certain discretionary bonuses.
ABSTRACT D was an investment bank in Dresdner Bank group (DB). On August 18, 2008, shortly before a takeover by C, D announced to its employees in a "town hall" meeting broadcast over the company intranet that DB's board had approved a "guaranteed" minimum bonus pool, which would be allocated to individuals on a discretionary basis according to individual performance "in the usual way". The aim was to retain employees at a time of speculation about DB's future. In December 2008, a letter to each employee confirmed that a discretionary bonus for 2008 had been provisionally awarded at a specified sum, subject to a "material adverse change clause" (MAC clause). On the same day, employees were reassured at a further town hall meeting that the MAC clause was unlikely to be invoked. In January 2009, after the acquisition of DB by C, the MAC clause was invoked and D's employees were told that their bonus awards would be cut by 90 per cent. The issues were (i) whether the August 18 announcement created an obligation to pay the bonus sums claimed; (ii) whether the introduction of the MAC clause was a breach of the implied duty of mutual trust and confidence. The first question involved consideration of three sub-issues: first, whether the announcement was an exercise of D's power to unilaterally vary its employees' terms and conditions under cl.1.4 of the employee handbook, which allowed such variation if the changes were made by a member of the human resources department and notified in writing, and also provided that a change affecting a group of people could be notified by "display" on the company intranet; second, whether the announcement was intended to be legally binding so as to be capable of having contractual effect; third, whether the employees had been obliged to communicate acceptance of the bonus offer. The judge found that D's communications amounted to a variation under cl.1.4 and were intended to be legally binding, and that the introduction of the MAC clause was a breach of the implied duty of mutual trust and confidence.
SUMMARY The court determined that an employer who had made an oral promise in a "town hall" meeting to pay relevant employees a guaranteed performance-based bonus had done so in accordance with powers of unilateral variation set out in the employee handbook and with the intention that the promise would be legally binding.
HELD Appeal dismissed.
HELD (1) (a) The variation had been effected in accordance with cl.1.4. D's communications had been made with the approval of the board of the remuneration committee. Since the HR director was a member of that board, no further endorsement by HR was necessary. Moreover, there was no reason why compliance could not be achieved by two documents. A change affecting a group of people did not need to be in writing, but needed only to be displayed on the company intranet. The August 18 announcement could be said to have been "displayed" on D's intranet by reason of its having been broadcast, even if the broadcast could not be viewed after the event (see paras 52-54 of judgment); (b) there was overwhelming evidence that D had intended its promise to be legally binding. Where a term was being introduced into a pre-existing contractual relationship, there was a very strong presumption that it was intended to be legally binding, and the onus was on the party asserting that there was no intention to create legal relations to establish that fact. The natural inference was that any promises made to staff relating to the terms of their employment would take effect in the same way as other contractual terms. That was supported by a number of matters: D's chief executive officer had made the promise, which implied that it must have been approved at the highest level; it was part of a vitally important staff retention strategy to prevent the potential collapse of the investment banking division; the nature of the promise assured staff that the fund was guaranteed come what may; and it was related to pay, the most fundamental obligation under the employment contract (paras 80-81, 89, 96); (c) D's employees were under no obligation to communicate acceptance of the bonus offer. D had plainly dispensed with the need for any response: it had made a promise without any disadvantage to its employees, and nobody hearing the announcement would expect that an employee could only benefit if he positively accepted the offer. That would have had the bizarre result that even if only a minority of the relevant employees accepted the offer, D would have had to pay them the whole of the bonus pool. Even if there was no unilateral change pursuant to cl.1.4, there was a binding contractual obligation to pay bonus payments in the usual way, at least to the limits of the guaranteed fund (paras 97-100). (2) The introduction of the MAC clause was a breach of the implied duty of mutual trust and confidence. The judge had been entitled to find that the MAC clause had been introduced as a result of pressure from C, which had been concerned about the public's negative perception of large bonus payments. He had objectively analysed the question of whether trust and confidence had been undermined and there was ample evidence to support his conclusion that it had (paras 130-140).

SUMMARY cargo; damage to cargo in violent storm; bad weather foreseen; availability of immunity under "perils of the sea" in Hague Rules
SUMMARY G's cargo of aluminium coils was damaged while being carried by sea by M, shipowners, in heavy weather across the Great Australian Bight. M's central planner had been responsible for the organisation of stowage of the freight on board ship. Only coils stowed in a particular part of the vessel, close to the hull of the ship had been damaged. The security and safety of the vessel itself had been the responsibility of the ship's master. The contract of carriage incorporated the Hague Rules and M sought to rely on the Hague Rules Art.IV r.2c which precluded liability resulting from the perils of the sea. G contended that M had been negligent in ignoring the master's advice as to stowage. G's appeal against the dismissal of its claim was dismissed and it appealed.
HELD dismissing the appeal, that the evidence demonstrated no negligence on the part of M in effecting stability calculations. All such calculations had been within the parameters set by the master, who had operated the vessel adequately in the conditions. In considering whether or not events resulted from perils of the sea, it was necessary to have regard to the condition of the vessel, whether the events asserted as "perils" were unexpected or a "freak occurrence", and the intensity of the conditions which had caused the damage. On the facts there was no evidence that M had been negligent in preparing the vessel for the voyage. Foreseeability of adverse weather did not preclude the operation of the immunity contained in Art.IV r.2(c).

SUMMARY Acceptance; place where contract made; telex communications
SUMMARY The rule about instantaneous communications between the parties is different from the rule about the post. The contract is only complete when the acceptance is received by the offeror; and the contract is made at the place where the acceptance is received. Thus, in the case of telex communications, the place where the contract is made is the place where the offeror receives the notification of the acceptance by the offeree. An English company and a Dutch company in Amsterdam concluded a contract by means of the telex system of communication whereby a message can be typed on a teleprinter in one country and be instantly recorded in another. An offer was sent by telex from England offering to pay GBP 239 a ton for 100 tons of Japanese cathodes and accepted by telex from Holland. On the question whether leave should be given to serve notice of the writ out of the jurisdiction, held, the contract was made in England and leave should be given for service out of the jurisdiction.

SUMMARY Carriage by sea; charterparty; repudiation; late payment
SUMMARY Failure to pay punctually on a charterparty will not amount to a repudiation in the absence of evidence of such an intention by the charterers. Payment is made when money is received by the creditor. The charterers hired a vessel "hire to be paid on the first day of each month." Payments were always late and the charterers were asked to ensure that payments were punctual. In April 1970 the charterers made payments on April 2. The shipowners withdrew the vessel from service as soon as they heard that payment had not been made on April 1.
HELD that (1) the charterers' failure to pay on the due date did not amount to a repudiation since no such intention had been evinced; but (2) the shipowners had validly exercised their right of withdrawal as they had not received payment on the due date and they had probably withdrawn before payment had been made.

CATEGORY Company Law Other Related Subjects: Contracts; Acceptance; Letters of Allotment; Non-Delivery; Postal Services
ABSTRACT The appellant (G) appealed against a decision finding him to be a shareholder in the respondent company (H).
ABSTRACT G had applied for shares in H and a letter was posted to him containing the notice of allotment. G never received the letter. H went into liquidation and the liquidator brought proceedings seeking payment from G for the shares. G denied being a shareholder.
ABSTRACT G argued that for him to be a shareholder the allotment of shares had to have been communicated to him and a letter posted but not received did not amount to 'communication'.
ABSTRACT (Bramwell L.J. dissenting) G was a shareholder. He had made an application for shares in H in circumstances which had to imply that he authorised H to send the allotment notice by post. The contract was made from the time the acceptance was posted by H and there was no distinction between a delay in delivery by the Post Office and its failure to deliver at all, Dunlop v Higgins 9 E.R. 805 followed, British & American Telegraph Co Ltd v Colson (1870-71) L.R. 6 Ex. 108 disapproved. Although on occasions inconvenience and hardship may follow from having a binding contract being formed when an offer was posted, it was impossible to adjust conflicting rights of the parties such that the consequences following a mistake on the part of a mutual agent, being the Post Office in the instant case, were borne equally by all parties. Further, there would not necessarily be great inconvenience or hardship because the offeror could always choose to make the formation of the contract dependent upon actual communication of the acceptance. (Per Bramwell L.J) posting a letter did not differ from other forms of communication in that for a person to be affected by a communication, it must have reached him.
SUMMARY Where it was expressly or impliedly authorised by the contractual parties that acceptance of an offer could be posted, the contract was completed on posting the acceptance, irrespective of whether delivery was delayed or failed to take place at all.

SUMMARY Arbitrators; Appointments; Misdirected acceptance of offer to agree to appoint arbitrator; Acceptance within reasonable time; Extension of time requiring circumstances outside reasonable contemplation of parties
SUMMARY The applicant ship owners (O) applied for a determination that an arbitrator had been validly appointed under a charterparty, alternatively for an extension of time to commence arbitral proceedings. O had chartered a vessel to the respondent charterers (C) on an amended Centricon form for the carriage of a cargo of maize from Argentina to Algeria. A dispute had arisen about demurrage. C had failed to pay O's claim for demurrage in full, and O decided to refer the dispute to arbitration under the charterparty arbitration clause and proposed the name of an arbitrator. C had put forward three other names. Within the 12 months permitted for appointment of an arbitrator under the charterparty arbitration clause, O had composed a reply by fax agreeing to the appointment of one of the arbitrators put forward by C. That fax and another fax chasing the matter some four months later had been sent to a wrong number and were never received by C. After another four months O had made contact with C and the proposed arbitrator (R) who had accepted the appointment. C disputed R's jurisdiction on the basis that he had not been appointed within the 12 month period from final discharge prescribed by the charterparty arbitration clause. O submitted that (1) C's offer to agree to the appointment of R as sole arbitrator had been accepted at the moment when the fax was sent to the wrong number; (2) alternatively, the offer to agree to the appointment of R as sole arbitrator had remained open for acceptance until O had purported to accept it; (3) there should if necessary be an extension of time under the Arbitration Act 1996 s.12(3)(a) .
HELD refusing the applications, that (1) rules about offer and acceptance should be clear so that parties knew where they stood. A situation in which it was unclear whether a contract had been formed until a court decided the issue in the exercise of some form of general discretion would be unsatisfactory. Acceptance by post was complete as soon as the letter, properly addressed, was put into the post-box, Adams v Lindsell 106 E.R. 250 and Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corp [1955] 2 Q.B. 327 considered. If the letter was wrongly addressed different considerations applied. It was unfair to the intended recipient that he should be bound by something which he was unlikely to receive because of the fault of the sender. Any such rule had the potential of givng a careless would-be acceptor an unfair advantage. The postal rule should not apply to misdirected letters of acceptance. A misdirected acceptance should take effect, if at all, at the time which was least favourable to the party responsible for the misdirection. (2) The letter of offer was implicitly open for acceptance only within a reasonable period. The fax to R, which was copied to C, was sent approximately eight months after C's offer to agree to the appointment of R. In the circumstances eight months was far in excess of a reasonable period for acceptance of C's offer. It followed that there had been no agreement to the appointment of R, and that he had no jurisdiction under the charterparty. (3) An extension of time for commencement of the arbitral proceedings under s.12 was refused. The clerical error in failing to send the fax to the right number and an omission to chase matters up with any promptitude were not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time when the contract was made as the kind of circumstance that might trigger an extension of time, Harbour & General Works Ltd v Environment Agency [2000] 1 W.L.R. 950 considered. It would not be just to extend the time for commencing arbitration proceedings in circumstances where C had the benefit of a contractual time bar.

SUMMARY Contract for sale; "subject to contract"
SUMMARY Where a document which is signed by the vendor and by the purchaser and which contains all the material terms of the contract concludes with the phrase: "This is a provisional agreement until a fully legalised agreement drawn up by a solicitor and embodying all the conditions herewith stated is signed", the effect of such a provision is not that the drawing up and signature of a formal document was to be a condition of there coming into existence a binding contract. On the contrary, it is something which, when it happens, will bring to an end a document which the parties clearly treat as being an operative document. The word "until" is not the right word to import a condition or a stipulation as to the event referred to, and the word "provisional" in this context does not mean "tentative" but means something which is going to operate until something else happens.

SUMMARY Formation; "subject to contract"; whether binding contract; motion to vacate cautions
SUMMARY An order vacating a caution or an estate contract can be made on motion if there is no fair arguable case in support of registration which ought to go to trial. Where letters constituted a detailed document cancelling and replacing a binding agreement this provided a very strong and exceptional context in which the words "subject to contract" should not be given their prima facie meaning. The plaintiffs acquired certain land and agreed to appoint the defendants as development consultants in connection with a planning permission and undertook that if on the grant of the planning permission they wished to dispose of their interest in whole or part they would either grant them the right to purchase or pay them GBP 500,000. By an exchange of letters, that agreement was cancelled and a fresh agreement entered into whereby the plaintiffs undertook, if they wished, following grant of planning permission, to dispose of any interest in the land, to serve on the defendants a notice of their willingness to sell a 51 per cent. interest in the freehold or to pay them GBP 500,000 and the defendants agreed to accept the notice in 28 days "subject to contract." The letters provided a detailed timetable for submission, approval, exchange of contracts and completion. The defendants registered cautions against the plaintiffs' titles on the register in respect of the agreement. Planning permission was granted and the plaintiffs served a notice of willingness to sell a 51 per cent. stake. The defendants duly accepted the notice subject to contract and asked for a draft contract to be submitted to them. The plaintiffs then contended that the letters amounted only to an agreement to agree and not a binding contract to convey a legal or beneficial interest in land. The defendants lodged a further caution to protect their "crystallised" interest. The plaintiffs issued an originating summons and by notice of motion sought to have the cautions vacated from the register.
HELD that an order vacating a caution or an estate contract could and ought to be made on motion if there was no fair arguable case in support of registration which ought to go to trial. If the issues were defined and their resolution depended only on ascertained documents and affidavit evidence, they could and ought to be decided, even though they involved a difficult question of construction or law. Accordingly, although the construction of the letters was difficult, they should be decided on the motion (Heywood v BDC Properties Ltd (No.1) [1963] 1 W.L.R. 975, Rawlplug Co Ltd v Kamvale Properties Ltd (1969) 20 P. & C.R. 32, Clearbrook Property Holdings Ltd v Verrier [1974] 1 W.L.R. 243 and Tiverton Estates Ltd v Wearwell Ltd [1975] Ch. 146 applied). The motion was dismissed since on their true construction the letters which constituted a detailed document replacing a previous binding agreement provided a very strong and exceptional context in which the words "subject to contract" should not be given their prima facie meaning whereby either party could withdraw before contracts were exchanged. Accordingly when the defendants accepted the plaintiffs' notice of willingness to sell, there was an agreement for the sale of the plaintiffs' interest in the land under which the defendants took an equitable interest (Chillingworth v Esche [1924] 1 Ch. 97 considered).

SUMMARY Enforceability; contract to negotiate with named party and no other; no specific time limit on agreement; whether enforceable
SUMMARY An agreement whereby one party for consideration agrees for a specified period of time not to negotiate with anyone else in relation to a sale of property can be enforceable but an agreement that is open-ended in terms of time is not enforceable. M owned a company and premises which he decided to sell. He received an offer of GBP 1.9 million from a third party and GBP 2 million from W. It was agreed in principle to sell to W and M warranted that the profits in the first year would be GBP 300,000. It was also agreed that if W provided a letter of comfort from their bank confirming the loan facilities to raise the GBP 2 million, then M would "terminate negotiations with any third party". W provided the letter but M, concerned that staff would not co-operate with W and hence not make GBP 300,000 profit, withdrew from negotiations. W brought an action for breach of the "lock-out" agreement which gave W exclusive opportunity to come to terms with M. The agreement was collateral to the main agreement and the consideration was the letter of comfort and W's continuation with true negotiations. M argued that the agreement was unenforceable. The judge upheld W's claim but the Court of Appeal found in favour of M.
HELD dismissing W's appeal, that a "lock-out" agreement could be enforceable but this agreement was not as it amounted to an agreement to negotiate for an unspecified period and so a vendor was not obliged to conclude the contract and would not know when he was entitled to withdraw from negotiations. The courts could not be expected to decide subjectively whether a proper reason for ending negotiations existed (Courtney & Fairbairn Ltd v Tolaini Brothers (Hotels) Ltd [1975] 1 W.L.R. 297 approved).

SUMMARY Implied term; payment of commission
SUMMARY The principle to be deducted from the cases as to whether or not there is an enforceable contract is that, if there is an essential term which has yet to be agreed and there is no express or implied provision for its solution, the result in point of law is that there is no binding contract. In seeing whether there is an implied provision for its solution, however, there is a difference between an arrangement which is wholly executory on both sides, and one which has been executed on one side or the other. In the ordinary way, if there is an arrangement to supply goods at a price "to be agreed", or to perform services on terms "to be agreed", then, although while the matter is still executory there may be no binding contract, nevertheless, if it is executed on one side, that is, if the one does his part without having come to an agreement as to the price or the terms, then the law will say that there is necessarily implied from the conduct of the parties a contract that, in default of agreement, a reasonable sum is to be paid. The defendants had agreed to buy 20,000 oilskins from the plaintiffs' friends at 5s. 6d. each. By letter to the plaintiffs they wrote: "We confirm that we have agreed to cover you on this transaction with a commission of 4d. per oilskin suit. We also undertake to cover you with an agreed commission on any other business transacted with your friends". In return for this you are to put us in direct touch with your friends". The plaintiffs thereupon put the defendants in direct touch with their friends and the defendants purchased first 1,000 oilskins and later 20,000 oilskins from one of these friends. When the plaintiffs claimed their commission on these transactions, the defendants repudiated liability on the ground that there was no legally enforceable bargain arising out of the letter, it being an agreement to pay a commission to be agreed and no further agreement having been reached, and that, even if the arrangement constituted an enforceable bargain, it was only a contract to pay commission on business arising directly from the introduction by the plaintiffs and the second transaction arose from an advertisement in a newspaper. Held, (1) there was nothing in the agreement limiting the commission to commission on orders directly attributable to the introduction, and, therefore, it included a transaction arising from an advertisement in a newspaper; (2) the commission was payable in respect of every subsequent transaction with friends who had originally been introduced by the plaintiffs; (3) the agreement was not confined to oilskins but also applied to entirely different commodities; and (4) "to cover you with an agreed commission" meant in the circumstances of the case to cover you with a reasonable commission and such a condition was not too vague to be enforceable, because a jury properly directed would be able to arrive at a proper conclusion as to what in the circumstances of this case was a reasonable commission.

SUMMARY Option to purchase; refusal to appoint valuer
SUMMARY Where a lessee exercises an option to purchase but the lessor refuses to appoint a valuer, the court may intervene to ascertain a fair and reasonable price and order specific performance of the contract. Various industrial premises were demised by four separate leases all due to expire in 1997, and all with clauses granting the lessees an option to purchase the reversion in fee simple at a price to be agreed by valuers appointed by both parties. The lessees exercised their options to purchase, but the lessors refused to appoint a valuer.
HELD allowing the lessee's appeal, that since the price was capable of being ascertained, a complete contract was constituted; the court could and would, if the machinery of ascertaining a price broke down, substitute its own to ascertain a fair and reasonable price (Vickers v Vickers (1867) L.R. 4 Eq. 529 and Agar v Macklew 57 E.R. 405 overruled).

SUMMARY Intention to create legal relations; consensus ad idem; uncertainty of term
SUMMARY A distinction must be drawn between a clause which is meaningless and a clause which is yet to be agreed. A clause which is meaningless can often be ignored while still leaving the contract good, whereas a clause which has yet to be agreed may mean that there is no contract at all because the parties have not agreed on all the essential terms. If one of the parties to a contract inserts into it an exempting condition in his own favour with which the other side agrees, and it afterwards appears that that condition is meaningless or is so ambiguous that no ascertainable meaning can be given to it, that does not render the whole contract a nullity. The only result is that the exempting condition is a nullity and must be rejected. On August 10, 1951, the plaintiff company sent the defendant a letter asking for written confirmation of an order for 3,000 tons of reinforcing bars of West German origin. The enclosed order specified the price and quality of the goods, the mode of payment and shipment, and certain other stipulations. By a letter dated August 16, the defendant acknowledged receipt of the order and stated: "As you have made the order direct to me, I am unable to confirm on my usual printed form which would have the usual force majeure and war clauses, but I assume that we are in agreement that the usual conditions of acceptance apply." The letter then gave particulars of the proposed shipment of the goods. By a letter dated August 29, the plaintiff company replied giving particulars of arrangements for the provision of shipping space and the opening of credit in respect of the goods. In answer to an allegation that the defendant had broken the contract by his failure to make the necessary deliveries, the defendant denied that there was a concluded contract between the parties.
HELD the letter of August 16 was an acceptance of the contract, both parties assuming that the usual conditions of acceptance applied; the words: "I assume we are in agreement that the usual conditions of acceptance apply" were meaningless, and ought to be ignored; consequently, there was a contract between the parties which was broken by the defendant, British Electrical and Associated Industries (Cardiff) Ltd v Patley Pressings Ltd [1953] 1 W.L.R. 280 distinguished and G Scammell and Nephew Ltd v HC&JG Ouston [1941] A.C. 251 distinguished.

SUMMARY N.

The plaintiffs sought an injunction restraining the two companies from manufacturing and selling the records on the ground that the transactions involved breaches of copyright.
HELD there was no "ordinary retail selling price" within the Copyright Act 1956 s.8 because the 1s. 6d. was not the whole consideration for the sale of the records; accordingly, neither N. Co. nor the record manufacturers were protected by the provisions of Copyright Act 1956 s.8.

SUMMARY Maintenance; agreement; consideration
SUMMARY The principle stated by Denning, J., in Central London Property Trust v. High Trees House [1947-51] C.L.Y. 5601 , does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties. In none of the decided cases was the defendant sued on a promise, assurance or assertion as a cause of action in itself. He was sued for some other cause, for example, a pension or a breach of contract, or possession, and the promise, assurance or assertion only played a supplementary role, though, no doubt, an important one. That is its true function. It may be part of a cause of action, but it is not a cause of action in itself. The principle is that where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the one who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to their previous legal relations as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced, even though the promise or assurance is not supported in point of law by any consideration. A divorced husband agreed in writing in 1943 to allow his former wife GBP 100 a year free of tax by way of permanent maintenance. Being aware that he was not then in good financial circumstances, she made no claim to permanent maintenance then. But in 1950 she brought an action on the agreement claiming arrears under it. Held, the wife could only enforce the agreement in writing for the payment of maintenance if there was consideration for it; there was no evidence of any intention by the husband that the wife should forbear from applying to the Court for maintenance, or, in other words, any request by the husband, express or implied, that the wife should so forbear; her forbearance was not intended by him, nor was it done at his request; therefore, it did not amount to consideration for the husband's promise.

SUMMARY Schedule D; Case VI; introduction of sale
SUMMARY The taxpayer received several approaches from persons interested in buying farmland for the purpose of extracting gravel therefrom. He himself had no interest in the land which was vested in a bank as trustee of the will of his wife's grandfather. His wife had no interest under the will but he was a practical farmer and he dealt with matters concerning the life tenant's occupation of the farm. He passed on to the bank the enquiries as to sale. One company was prepared to offer GBP 100,000 for the land, and in answer to the taxpayer's question "What's in it for me?" a director of the company said that the taxpayer would be paid GBP 10,000 if the company purchased the land for GBP 100,000 or less. The reference to the GBP 10,000 was not passed on to the bank. When the bank asked the taxpayer for his comments on the offer of GBP 100,000 for the sale, he replied that he personally would accept it, but he made no further recommendations. The sale for GBP 100,000 was completed and the taxpayer received the promised GBP 10,000 from the company. He was assessed to income tax on this sum. The general commissioners found (a) that on the facts there was no contractual basis for the GBP 10,000 at all, (b) that this sum was not therefore a payment for services and (c) that the assessment ought therefore to be discharged. On appeal by the Revenue, held that the appeal be dismissed.

SUMMARY Consideration; subsidiary agreements; commercial pressure
SUMMARY An agreement made in consideration of an act done before the making of the agreement may be enforceable where, inter alia, such act was done at the provisor's request. Per curiam: Economic duress is capable of vitiating an agreement where it is such as to negative consent. The plaintiffs agreed to sell their shares in a private company to a company of which the defendants were majority shareholders in consideration of the issue to them of shares in the purchasing company. So as not to depress the market value of such shares the plaintiffs further agreed with the defendants that they would not sell 60 per cent of the newly issued shares until April 1974, the defendants agreeing, so that the plaintiffs might be protected against a fall in the value of the shares during such period, to purchase them at the end of that period at USD 2.50 each. Shortly afterwards the plaintiffs realised that the effect of such subsidiary agreement would be to deprive them of any increase in the value thereof. They therefore refused to complete the main agreement unless the defendants in substitution for the subsidiary agreement agreed to indemnify them against any reduction in value of the shares below the price of USD 2.50 each during the deferment period. The defendants, fearing the consequences of delay in completion of the main agreement, so agreed, the agreement being expressed to be in consideration of the plaintiffs having agreed to sell their shares in the private company. The main agreement was performed, and thereafter the value of the shares fell below USD 2.50 each. The plaintiffs claimed an indemnity, which was refused by the defendants on the grounds, inter alia, that the consideration for the indemnity agreement was past consideration and/or that any such agreement was voidable by reason of the economic duress applied by the plaintiffs.
HELD that (1) an antecedent act could be valid consideration where it was done at the promisor's request, where the parties understood that such act was to be remunerated by the conferment of a benefit and where such benefit would have been enforceable if promised in advance; and such criteria were here satisfied; (2) a promise to perform a contractual obligation for the benefit of a third party was good consideration; and (3) the commercial pressure to which the defendants had been subjected had not been such as to negative their consent to the indemnity agreement.

ABSTRACT The plaintiff lessor (C) sought to recover rent from the defendant lessee (H).
ABSTRACT By a lease made in 1937, C had granted H a tenancy of a block of flats in London for a term of 99 years at a ground rent of £2,500 a year. The block of flats was a new one and was not fully occupied at the start of the Second World War owing to the absence of people from London. With war conditions prevailing, it was apparent to those responsible that the rent under the lease could not be paid out of the profits of the flats, and discussions took place between the directors of C and H which resulted in an written arrangement whereby the ground rent would be reduced as from the commencement of the lease to £1,250 per annum. H paid the reduced rent from 1941 to the beginning of 1945, by which time all the flats in the block were fully let, and continued to pay it thereafter. C sought to recover £625, being the difference between rent at the rate of £2,500 per annum and rent at the rate of £1,250 per annum for the last two quarters of 1945. By its defence H pleaded that there had been an agreement that the rent should be £1,250 only and that such agreement related to the whole term of the lease. In the alternative, H asserted that C was estopped from alleging that the rent exceeded £1,250 per annum.
SUMMARY A promise which was intended to create legal relations and which was acted on was binding in law, despite the absence of consideration.
HELD Judgment for plaintiff.
HELD There had been a series of decisions over the last 50 years which, although they were said to be cases of estoppel, were not really such. They were cases in which a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact acted on. In such cases, the courts had said that the promise had to be honoured. In each case, the court held the promise to be binding on the party making it, even though under the old common law it might be difficult to find any consideration for it. The courts had not gone so far as to give a cause of action in damages for the breach of such a promise, but they had refused to allow the party making it to act inconsistently with it. It was in that sense, and that sense only, that such a promise gave rise to an estoppel. The time had now come for the validity of such a promise to be recognised. The logical consequence, no doubt, was that a promise to accept a smaller sum in discharge of a larger sum, if acted on, was binding notwithstanding the absence of consideration; and if the fusion of law and equity led to that result, so much the better. A binding promise had been made in the instant case. As to the scope of that promise, the evidence showed that C had agreed that the ground rent would be reduced to £1,250 a year as a temporary expedient while the block of flats was not fully, or substantially fully, let owing to the conditions prevailing. When the flats became fully let, early in 1945, the reduction ceased to apply. Rent was therefore payable at the full rate for the last two quarters of 1945.

SUMMARY Equitable estoppel; change of position
SUMMARY There is an equitable principle of promissory estoppel that, when one party to a contract agrees in the absence of fresh consideration not to enforce his rights, an equity will be raised in favour of the other party. This equity is, however, subject to the qualifications: (1) that the other party has altered his position; (2) that the promisor can resile from his promise on giving reasonable notice, which need not be formal notice, giving the promisee a reasonable opportunity of resuming his position, and (3) the promise only becomes final and irrevocable if the promise cannot resume his position. P claimed hire-purchase instalments for motor lorries. D's defence was the above equity, based on a letter from P written when D had reported trouble with the lorries . . . "we are agreeable to you withholding instalments due on the Seddon Tippers as long as they are withdrawn from active service." D failed to establish any changes of position in reliance on this letter, but simply left the lorries out of service when they had been repaired and continued not to pay the instalments.
HELD that P's action succeeded. (Birmingham & District Land Co v London & North Western Railway Co (No.2) (1888) 40 Ch.

SUMMARY Costs; powers of court; absence of legal representation; assessment; guidelines
SUMMARY If a court in criminal proceedings awards an excessive amount of costs it acts outside the discretion conferred on it under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1973 s.2, and the award can be quashed by the Divisional Court. The same is true if the court takes account of irrelevant factors in the award of costs. D owned a take-away food store which was visited twice by an environmental health inspector. He served 37 summonses on D and 35 on his son alleging breaches of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1970. They pleaded guilty by post, and were not represented. The prosecuting authority were not legally represented. The justices ordered D to pay costs of GBP 15 in respect of 35 summonses, and GBP 25 in respect of the other two, making a total of GBP 575, as well as fining him GBP 975. D's son was also fined, and ordered to pay GBP 525 in costs. The justices gave reasons for their award of costs. D applied to quash the orders on the grounds that they were harsh and oppressive or so far outside the normal sums imposed as to involve an error of law and that the justices approached the case with rigid criteria in mind without regard to the merits of the case.
HELD granting the application, that although the local authority was entitled to be reimbursed for costs properly incurred, the amount of costs was so great that the inference to be drawn was that the justices had erred in law in exercising their discretion (R. v St Albans Crown Court Ex p. Cinnamond [1981] Q.B. 480 applied). The justices' reasons disclosed that they took into account the irrelevant matters of the source of the local authority's revenue and its duty to prosecute such cases. It was inappropriate to use a scale of costs awarded in legal aid cases to a situation where a legally unqualified officer of the authority conducted the prosecution and there was no legal representation, or to multiply the costs by the number of summonses issued as a result of the inspection of the premises. In the circumstances the order for costs, which should have been GBP 74, would be quashed.

Per Lord Denning, M.R.: If there is a genuine accord, acted on by the debtor to his detriment, equity prevents the creditor from suing for the rest of the debt. P was in desperate straits for money and accepted from D a GBP 300 cheque for a GBP 482 13s. 1d. debt "in completion of the account."

ABSTRACT The appellant (C) appealed against a decision not to set aside a statutory demand served on him by the respondent (W).
ABSTRACT W had obtained a judgment by consent against three partners of whom C was one. The partners' liability was joint. The consent order provided for the three partners to pay the judgment debt by monthly instalments. C had paid a third of the debt by instalments. His partners had become bankrupt. W served a statutory demand on C for the balance of the judgment debt. C applied to set aside the demand relying on an alleged agreement by W that if C continued to pay his share of the judgment W would not look to him but only to his partners for the balance.
ABSTRACT C submitted that (1) his alleged agreement with W was binding because by agreeing to accept sole responsibility for his one-third share he gave consideration for W's promise to accept him as a debtor for only a one-third share of the judgment debt; (2) a promissory estoppel prevented W from proceeding against him for more than a one-third share of the debt.
SUMMARY A statutory demand was set aside where the debtor had an arguable case of promissory estoppel.
HELD Appeal allowed.
HELD (1) The mere fact that a creditor agreed with a joint debtor to accept payment from him alone of his proportionate share did not result in a binding agreement. The alleged agreement made between C and W was merely to accept a lesser sum from C than that which was due and that was not a binding agreement in law since it had no consideration to support it, Foakes v Beer (1884) 9 App. Cas. 605 applied. (2) There was a real prospect of success on the promissory estoppel issue. It was arguable that there was an agreement or representation by W not to sue C for the full judgment sum. It could be sufficient reliance for the purpose of promissory estoppel if a lesser payment was made as agreed, provided there was an accord, D&C Builders Ltd v Rees [1966] 2 Q.B. 617 considered. It was arguable that it would be inequitable for W to resile from its promise, D&C Builders Ltd v Rees considered.

SUMMARY Variation; resumption of legal rights after suspension
SUMMARY There are some cases where a period of suspension of legal rights terminates on the happening of a certain event, or the cessation of a previously existing state of affairs, or on the lapse of a reasonable period thereafter. In such cases, no notice of any kind may be necessary. But in other cases, where there is nothing to fix the end of the period which may be dependent on the will of the person who has made the concession, equity will, no doubt, require some notice together with a reasonable period for re-adjustment before the grantor is allowed to enforce his strict rights. In such cases the notice need not take any particular form, nor need it specify a date for the termination of the period. The principle should be applied with great caution to purely creditor-and-debtor relationships which involve no question of forfeiture or cancellation. In 1938 the plaintiffs, who were the registered proprietors of letters patent relating to hard metal alloys, granted the defendants a licence under the patents to sell and use the contract material on payment of a royalty of 10 per cent on the net value of all contract material sold or used. The agreement further provided that if the aggregate quantity of the contract material sold or used by the defendants other than contract materials supplied to them by the plaintiffs or their licensees under the patents should exceed a quota of fifty kilograms in any month, they should pay to the plaintiffs compensation equal to 30 per cent of the sum which represented the excess net value. The compensation or penalty rates presented the defendants with an ever-increasing burden by reason of the growth in production resulting from war-time requirements. As a result the plaintiffs decided that they would not continue to demand payment of the compensation under the agreement and in fact did not enforce such payment throughout the war. The defendants thereupon based their production policy on the footing that only the 10 per cent royalty would be payable whilst the arrangement continued in force. In July, 1945, the defendants commenced proceedings against the plaintiffs, claiming damages for fraud. By their counterclaim (which was delivered with the defence on March 26, 1946), the plaintiffs alleged that since March 31, 1942, the defendants had sold and used contract material, some of which was made in accordance with the revelant patents, but, in breach of their obligations under the deed, had not since that date rendered any accounts or paid the sums due for royalties and compensation. They waived their claim to enforce payment of compensation in respect of deliveries made before the end of hostilities with Germany. Devlin, J. dismissed the action, the defendants having failed to establish the charges of fraudulent misrepresentation, but he gave judgment for the plaintiffs on the counterclaim holding that the arrangement for suspension of payment of compensation had been terminated by the presentation of a new agreement to the defendants. The Court of Appeal held that the presentation of the new agreement did not operate to determine the arrangement for suspension and held that up to the date of the counterclaim no notice requiring the payment of compensation had been given. In the present proceedings the plaintiffs alleged that the delivery of the counterclaim in the first action was a sufficient notice of their intention to enforce payment of compensation and that the time between the delivery of the counterclaim and January 1, 1947, was a reasonable time. Pearson, J. held that the delivery of the counterclaim in the first action terminated the arrangement for suspension. The Court of Appeal held that the arrangement for suspension was not terminated by the delivery of the counterclaim in the first action; that the defendants were entitled to express notice if the old terms were to be enforced again; and that such notice should specify either some future date, or at least a reasonable period, from which, or on the expiration of which, the payments were to be resumed.
HELD on appeal, the delivery of the counterclaim was sufficient notice of termination of the arrangement for suspension of payment of compensation; the compensation clause did not impose a penalty, nor was it in restraint of trade, nor did it offend against the Patents and Designs Act 1907 s.38(1)(a) , which invalidates a clause in a licence restricting the licensee from using material supplied by a person other than the licensor; consequently, the appeal must be allowed.

SUMMARY An employee who regularly carries fellow-employees to work in his car with the understood expectation of some compensation is carrying them "for hire or reward." Q regularly gave lifts to some of his fellow-employees. The judge found that Q expected to receive and his passengers expected to pay something for each lift, although the amount varied. The judge also found that no contractual relationship was intended by either party. A, a passenger, was killed through Q's negligence and A's widow obtained judgment against Q which remained unsatisfied because Q's insurance company failed. A's widow sued the Motor Insurers' Bureau which denied liability on the ground that the carriage concerned was not for "hire or reward."
HELD that a contract for payment was unnecessary and that the systematic carrying of passengers in the expectation of payment constituted the vehicle one used for carrying passengers for hire or reward.

SUMMARY Matrimonial home; husband's work on wife's house
SUMMARY The Married Women's Property Act 1882 s.17 is purely procedural; it does not confer on the court an unfettered discretion to override existing rights in property, or to apply any notion of family assets not to be found in English law in determining disputes as to title or possession after a marriage has broken down. Such issues involve questions of social policy which should be dealt with by Parliament. The legal title to H and W's former matrimonial home was in W alone. H had not paid any money towards its purchase but he had redecorated and improved the home, thus enhancing its value. Following a divorce H issued proceedings under s.17 claiming an interest in the proceeds of sale of the home.
HELD allowing W's appeal, (1) that s.17 was merely procedural, and (2) that in the absence of any agreement or estoppel to the contrary W was absolutely entitled to the home or the proceeds of its sale. ( Appleton v Appleton [1965] 1 W.L.R. 25 overruled).

SUMMARY Statute of Frauds; contract to leave property on death
SUMMARY For a contract to be made it must be the intention of both parties to create an arrangement binding in law; a written offer may be a sufficient memorandum within the Law of Property Act 1925 s.40(1), although there is no contract until after it has been accepted. C. wrote to P. offering to share his house with P. and Mrs. P. on terms as to sharing expenses, also offering that he and his wife would on their death leave their house to Mrs. P., her sister and her daughter, and suggesting that P. and Mrs. P. should sell their cottage. P. accepted the offer and the two couples shared the C.s' house until the P.s left as an alternative to being evicted.
HELD both sides having intended to create a legally binding arrangement, there was a good contract of which C.'s letter was a sufficient memorandum; accordingly the P.s were entitled to damages for breach of their right to live in the C.s' house until the death of the survivor of the C.s, and Mrs. P. was entitled to damages for loss of the value of her prospects of taking a share of the C.s' house at their death.

SUMMARY Intention to create legal relations; promise of ex gratia payment
SUMMARY 1. Where an agreement is reached in the course of business relations and there was an intention to agree, there is a heavy onus on the party who asserts that no legal effect was intended. 2. The words "ex gratia" in a promise to pay do not carry a necessary, or even a probable, implication that the agreement is to be without legal effect. The words merely indicate that there was no pre-existing obligation to pay. An airline company agreed with the British Airline Pilots Association to make to redundant pilots "an ex gratia payment" of a specified size. There was consideration for this promise. In an action by a redundant pilot for his payment, held that there was an enforceable right to it, and the action succeeded. (Rose & Frank Co v JR Crompton & Bros Ltd [1923] 2 K.B. 261 considered).

SUMMARY L, the head of a barristers' chambers, appealed against a declaration that E's acceptance of an unpaid pupillage was a binding apprenticeship and that E was therefore a worker entitled to the national minimum wage. L, challenging the existence of an apprenticeship, contended that the arrangement was educational in nature, not commercial, and that it was not enforceable due to a lack of consideration. The court, while finding that a binding contract did exist, held that E was not an apprentice nor a "worker" within the meaning of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, because there had been no expectation upon her to do any work for L or do anything other than further her own training.
SUMMARY E accepted an unpaid 12 month pupillage with a barristers' chambers. In friendly litigation brought at the Bar Council's instigation, E sought and was granted declarations ([2000] I.R.L.R. 18) that her acceptance of the pupillage created an apprenticeship contract, that she was a "worker" within the meaning of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 s.54(3)(a) and that, being over 26 years old, she was entitled by virtue of the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 Reg.12 to be paid the national minimum wage during her pupillage. L, a barrister belonging to the chambers, appealed, contending that the offer to provide E with education and training was not enforceable as a contract since there had been no intention to create legal relations and E had provided no consideration. Furthermore, L argued, the relationship between the parties was regulated by Bar Council guidelines relating to pupillage which rendered a further contract unnecessary.
HELD allowing the appeal, that (1) there was a binding contract for the provision of education and training which impliedly incorporated regulatory materials governing pupillage; (2) a broad view had to be taken of the relationship between E and the barristers' chambers. It was in the chambers' long term interests to attract talented pupils and, regardless of whether E was a prospective candidate for tenancy or not, her agreement to that potentially productive relationship had been consideration for the offer, and (3) the construction of "apprenticeship" in s.54(2) of the 1998 Act was intended to be unlegalistic and covered learned professions. However, a cardinal ingredient of an apprenticeship was a mutual covenant whereby the master undertook to educate and train the apprentice, who, in return, was bound to serve and work for the master. In the instant case, there had been no expectation on E to provide valuable service and she was not obliged to do anything which was not conducive to her own training, hence she did not work under a contract of apprenticeship or an equivalent contract.

SUMMARY "Comfort letters" in which one company assumes a moral but not a legal obligation to help another have no contractual effect. The plaintiff bank agreed with the defendants to make a loan facility of up to GBP 10m available to the defendants' wholly owned subsidiary M which traded in tin on the London metal exchange. As part of the arrangement the defendants furnished to the plaintiff two letters of comfort each of which stated that "it is our policy to ensure that the business of M is at all times in a position to meet its liabilities to you under the loan facility arrangements." In 1985, the tin market collapsed and M went into liquidation owing the plaintiff bank the whole loan. The plaintiff sought payment from the defendants who refused to pay. The plaintiff brought an action against them, and the judge held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover.
HELD allowing the appeal, that a letter of comfort from a parent company to a lender did not have contractual effect if it was merely a statement of present fact regarding the parent company's intentions and was not a contractual promise as to the parent company's future conduct. On the facts, the letter of comfort was in terms a statement of present fact and not a promise as to future conduct and in the context in which the letters were written was not intended to be anything other than a representation of fact giving rise to no more than a moral responsibility on the part of the defendants to meet M's debt ( Edwards v Skyways [1964] 1 W.L.R. 349 distinguished; and Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon [1976] Q.B. 801 considered).

SUMMARY Buidling and engineering contracts; whether time sheet could vary contract
SUMMARY TCE, a civil engineering contractor, appealed against a decision that it should indemnify RM against liability for personal injuries. TCE hired a plant driver from RM who presented a time sheet for the signature of TCE's agent at the end of each week which contained the words "All hire undertaken under CPA conditions". TCE argued that this did not vary the contract to incorporate the CPA conditions and therefore they were not bound to indemnify RM against third party liability.
HELD allowing the appeal, that a time sheet for work done under an existing contract was a record of a party's performance of contractual obligations. It was not a document with contractual effect. Contractual effect could only be established by variation of the original contract. The CPA conditions were therefore not incorporated and TCE were not bound to indemnify RM.

SUMMARY Exemption clause; misrepresentation
SUMMARY If a person wishes to exempt himself from a liability which the common law imposes on him, he can only do it by an express stipulation brought home to the party affected and assented to by him as part of the contract. If the party affected signs a written document, knowing it to be a contract which governs the relations between both parties, his signature is irrefragable evidence of his assent to the whole contract, including the exempting clauses, unless the signature is shown to be obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. Any behaviour by words or conduct is sufficient to be a misrepresentation if it is such as to mislead the other party about the existence or extent of the exemption. An innocent as well as a fraudulent misrepresentation is sufficient to disentitle the creator of it to the benefit of the exemption. The plaintiff had deposited her wedding dress with the defendants for cleaning. She was asked to sign a document which contained in it a condition excluding all liability on the part of the defendants for any damage to any article in their keeping. Before she signed the document, she asked why she was to do so and the assistant told her that the defendants would not accept any responsibility for damage to the beads or sequins on the dress. She did not read all the document. When the dress was returned there was a stain on the front of it, which had not been there before. The county court judge found that the defendants had not discharged the onus of showing that they had not been negligent, because there was a time while the dress was in their possession in transit during which the stain might have been caused, and he held that the oral statement by the assistant amounted to a misrepresentation so as to preclude the defendants from relying on the document limiting their liability for damage.
HELD on appeal, that there plainly had been a misrepresentation, and owing to that misrepresentation the exception never became part of the contract between the parties, Low v Bouverie [1891] 3 Ch. 82 , R. v Lord Kylsant [1932] 1 K.B. 442 , L'Estrange v F Graucob Ltd [1934] 2 K.B. 394 and Olley v Marlborough Court Ltd [1948] 1 All E.R. 955 applied. Per Denning, L.J.: "I do not wish it to be supposed that the cleaners would have been better off if the assistant had simply handed over the document to the customer without asking her to sign it; or if a customer was not so inquiring as the plaintiff, but was an unsuspecting person who signed whatever she was asked without question":

ABSTRACT The appellant hotel owner (M) appealed against a decision ( [1948] 1 All E.R. 955 ) that it had negligently allowed the theft of the possessions of the respondent guest (O) from its hotel.
ABSTRACT M ran a residential hotel where O had stayed for several months. In O's bedroom was a notice stating that M would not be liable for articles lost or stolen unless handed to M for safe custody. O went out of the hotel, leaving her room key on a key rack in reception. While M's staff were not watching, a man took the key and stole items from O's room. The judge found that M had been negligent, that the negligence had caused O's loss, that the hotel was a private hotel rather than a common inn, and that although O had seen the notice, its terms were ambiguous and had not absolved M from liability.
ABSTRACT M argued that (1) on the facts, it had not been negligent; (2) the notice formed part of the contract between it and O and operated to exempt it from liability for negligence; (3) its liability was limited to that of a residential hotel.
SUMMARY A hotel could not rely on a notice displayed in its bedroom to exempt it from liability for negligence. Guests would not see the notice until after they had been accepted as guests, meaning that it could not form part of the contract between hotel and guest.
HELD Appeal dismissed.
HELD (1) M had been negligent and was liable at common law for O's loss. O had left the key in M's charge, and it was M's duty to take reasonable care to see that it was not taken by an unauthorised person. It had been taken, and reasonably foreseeable consequences had followed: a thief had used it to steal from the room. (2) M could not rely on the notice in the bedroom. It could not form part of the contract. Those relying on a contract to exempt themselves from common law liability had to strictly prove its terms and the intention to create legal relations. The best way of proving intention was by a written document signed by the party to be bound. Another way was handing him before or at the time of the contract a written notice specifying its terms and making it clear that the contract was on those terms. The same effect could be achieved by a prominent public notice made plain for the party to see when he made the contract, or by an express oral stipulation. Nothing short of one of those ways would suffice. Notices put up in bedrooms did not make a contract: as a rule, guests did not see them until after they had been accepted as guests. (3) The question of whether, had O agreed to be bound by it, the notice would have exempted M from liability for its negligence should not depend on whether the hotel was a common inn with the liability of an insurer, or a private hotel with liability only for negligence. It should depend on the words of the contract. In order to exempt a person from liability for negligence, the exemption should be clear on the face of the contract; it should not depend on what view the courts might take of the nature of the hotel. Whether it was a common inn or a private hotel, a notice in the terms of that in the instant case would not exempt the hotel from liability for negligence but only from any liability as insurer. The notice could be construed as a warning that the hotel was not liable in the absence of negligence. As such it served a useful purpose of warning the guest to take care of his things; it was unnecessary to go further and construe it as a contractual exemption.

SUMMARY Hire; plant hire; implied terms
SUMMARY An owner's contractual conditions may be incorporated into a contract of hire on the basis of a common understanding between the parties that such conditions applied. P and D were both engaged in the business of hiring out earth-moving equipment. D were also involved in drainage work on marshy ground and urgently requiring a crane, agreed to hire such a crane from P, terms of payment being agreed but no mention being made of P's conditions of hire. P sent D a copy of such conditions which provided, inter alia, that the hirer would be responsible for all expenses arising out of the crane's use. Before D signed the form containing the conditions, the crane sank into the marsh through no fault of D and P claimed from D the cost of recovering the crane.
HELD allowing P's claim, that P's conditions of hire applied since both parties were in the trade and of equal bargaining power and on the evidence D and P both understood that P's conditions of hire would apply.

SUMMARY Conditions; printed on delivery note; onerous and unusual conditions; whether brought sufficiently to attention; whether term of contract
SUMMARY Clear and reasonable efforts must be made to bring any particularly onerous and unusual conditions to the attention of the other party if they are to form part of a contract. The defendants, an advertising agency, required photographs for a 1950's presentation. The plaintiffs despatched 47 transparencies with a delivery note which stated that the transparencies were to be returned in 14 days, and that a holding fee of GBP 5 per day for each transparency would be charged if they were not. The defendants did not use the transparencies, put them to one side and forgot about them for a further two weeks. To their no doubt considerable consternation an invoice arrived for GBP 3,783 holding fee. They refused to pay. The plaintiffs obtained judgment.
HELD allowing the appeal, that where a condition was particularly onerous or unusual, the party seeking to enforce it had to show that it had been fairly and reasonably brought to the other's attention. The condition was unreasonable and extortionate and had not been sufficiently brought to the defendant's attention. It did not form part of the contract (Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking [1971] 2 Q.B. 163 applied).

SUMMARY Conditions and warranties; notice
SUMMARY In the absence of any contractual document, a consignor of goods cannot, by a course of previous dealing, be bound by conditions of which he is generally aware but the specific terms of which he has no knowledge.Per Lord Devlin: Previous dealings are relevant only if they prove knowledge of the terms, actual and not constructive, and assent to them. A required his motor car to be shipped by R, and A's agent received a receipt for the freight paid. The ship sank and the car was a total loss. R contended that he was absolved from liability for negligence in accordance with the terms of the conditions of carriage displayed at his office. The normal practice in accepting goods for shipment was to give the consignor a "risk note," stating the conditions of carriage, which was to be signed by the consignor. No such note was given on this occasion, but on previous occasions A or his agent had sometimes signed a "risk note." Both A and his agent knew that certain conditions were imposed but neither knew specifically what they were.
HELD allowing A's appeal, that this was an oral contract and the conditions relied on were not imported into it so as to exempt R from liability in negligence.

SUMMARY Conditions and warranties; representation not a warranty
SUMMARY The following principles apply in considering the question whether a representation is a condition, a warranty or an innocent misrepresentation: 1. Where an assumption is fundamental to a contract that does not prove that it is a term of the contract. If the assumption turns out to have been wrong the result will be that there was a mistake of fundamental importance by both parties to the contract. That mistake does not make the contract a nullity from the beginning, but it does in some circumstances enable the contract to be set aside in equity. 2. A "warranty" denotes a binding promise. The word is also used in order to denote a subsidiary term in a contract as distinct from a vital term which is called a "condition." 3. A warranty as a statement which is a term of the contract must be distinguished from an innocent misrepresentation. The distinction is best expressed by the ruling of Holt C.J. in Pasley v. Freeman , "was it intended as a warranty or not?" 4. The question whether a warranty was intended depends upon the conduct of the parties, on their words and behavior, rather than on their thoughts. If an intelligent bystander would reasonable infer that a warranty was intended, that will suffice. And this, when the facts are not in dispute, is a question of law. 5. When the seller states a fact which is or should be within his own knowledge and of which the buyer is ignorant, intending that the buyer should act on it and he does so, it is easy to infer a warranty. So also if the seller makes a promise about something which is or should be within his own control. If, however, the seller, when he states a fact, makes it clear that he has no knowledge of his own but has got his information elsewhere, and is merely passing it on, it is not so easy to imply a warranty. 6. If an oral representation is afterwards recorded in writing, it is good evidence that it was intended as a warranty. If it is not put into writing, it is evidence against a warranty being intended; but it is by no means decisive. The defendant sold to the plaintiffs, who were motor traders, a Morris car, which according to the registration book was first registered in 1948, for GBP 290. Eight months later the plaintiffs discovered that the car was made in 1939. If they had known this they would have given only GBP 175 for it. The defendant honestly believed that it was a 1948 model. The plaintiffs claimed damages for breach of contract.
HELD on the facts, the defendant, in offering a 1948 Morris and producing the registration book, did not intend to bind himself so as to warrant that it was a 1948 model; accordingly the plaintiffs' claim failed.

SUMMARY Conditions and warranties; mileage of car
SUMMARY If a representation is made in the course of dealings for a contract for the very purpose of inducing the other party to act upon it by entering into the contract, that is prima facie ground for inferring that it was intended as a warranty. The maker of the representation can rebut this by showing that he was entirely innocent of fault in making it and that it would not be reasonable in the circumstances for him to be bound by it. During negotiations for the purchase of a second-hand Bentley the seller said it had done only 20,000 miles since fitted with a replacement engine and gearbox. This was wrong, the true figure being nearer 100,000, as the seller could have discovered by asking the manufacturer. On a claim for damages for breach of warranty as to this mileage, held that it was a warranty, not a mere innocent misrepresentation, and the action succeeded.

CATEGORY Damages Other Related Subjects: Contracts; Aviation; Aircraft Components; Breach of Contract; Measure of Damages; Mitigation
ABSTRACT The claimant airline (T) claimed damages for the breach of three contracts made with the defendant (K), a Japanese company which manufactured aircraft seats.
ABSTRACT Under the contracts, K had agreed to supply economy-class seats for three groups of aircraft. Some of the seats were delivered late and others were not delivered at all. Among other consequences of those defaults, T was prevented from using five new aircraft for around 18 months until seats were obtained from another supplier. K had admitted liability. The issues which remained in dispute concerned the measure of damages. The largest item of damages claimed (just under $162 million) was the cost of leasing aircraft from a third party for a three-year period. In addition, damages of $21 million were sought in respect of the cost of buying and installing replacement seats for some of the aircraft. A central plank of the defence was that, even where costs were incurred by T as a result of K's breaches of contract, T had also gained certain benefits from the mitigating actions taken which had to be brought into account in calculating damages. Thus, K claimed that T could not recover the cost of the leases, as the benefits gained from leasing the aircraft and other mitigating steps taken by T not only eliminated the losses which would otherwise have resulted from the loss of aircraft capacity caused by K's breaches of contract but covered the cost of the leases as well. K also asserted that the replacement seats bought by T were lighter than the seats ordered and that the installation of lighter seats had generated and would continue to generate savings in the cost of fuel for which T should give credit. K also maintained that certain credits granted to T when it bought further aircraft were attributable to the delays in the delivery of aircraft caused by K's breaches and had therefore to be brought into account.
SUMMARY The court assessed damages in a case where a manufacturer of aircraft seats had admitted the late delivery and, in certain instances, the non-delivery of seats to the claimant airline.
HELD Damages assessed.
HELD (1) When T entered into the leases, it could reasonably have expected to obtain replacement seats for the relevant aircraft and bring them into service well within two years of the lease terms. Accordingly, while the main reason for leasing the aircraft was to mitigate the consequences of K's breaches of contract, that reason did not justify leasing the aircraft for three years rather than two. The choice of a three-year rather than a two-year lease term was driven by other commercial considerations. The decision to lease the aircraft for a third year was not a step which was taken nor which it would have been reasonable for T to take in mitigation of loss and was therefore not attributable to K's breaches of contract. K had failed to prove that the net benefits which T had obtained from having the three leased aircraft in its fleet during the first two years of the leases were sufficient to offset all the losses resulting from the delayed entry into service, or the restricted use, of the aircraft caused by K's breaches of contract. T was entitled to recover lease costs of $107 million (see paras 56, 62, 138-139 of judgment). (2) If as a result of buying lighter replacement seats in mitigation of its loss T had saved or would save money, the amount saved would have to be brought into account in the assessment of damages. However, the burden of proof was on K to establish the fact and amount of any such saving. It had not discharged that burden in relation to what were known as the Recaro seats. However, in relation to what were known as the ZIM seats, the expert evidence did justify a finding that T had incurred a saving which should be brought into account (paras 144, 152, 158). (3) T had obtained a price reduction from the supplier of the aircraft in which K's seats were to be installed. There were two effective causes of that reduction: K's breach of contract and the bargaining power which T was able to exploit through being a good customer of the supplier. When the defendant's breach of contract combined with another effective cause to result in loss to the claimant, the loss was recoverable; the same principle had to apply to gains. Credit had therefore to be given in the calculation of damages for the benefit to T of the price reduction. Further, T had been granted various credits on the purchase of new aircraft after the relevant events. Three credits remained in dispute. One was a credit to offset the amount of an invoice which the supplier had issued to T claiming "disruption costs" resulting from the delayed delivery caused by K's breaches. T had failed to prove that it was liable to pay the sum offset and was therefore not entitled to recover that sum from K. The receipt by T of the other two credits had not been caused by K's breaches of contract. It was reasonable to infer that the supplier would have been willing to make similar credits available to T as an incentive to buy new aircraft irrespective of the problems caused by K's breaches of contract. Those credits were therefore not to be brought into account in the assessment of damages (paras 172, 176-179, 187-188, 191).

SUMMARY IPC applied for an injunction to restrain EC from breaking a beer tie contained in its lease and for an account of damages for breach of the clause. EC counterclaimed that, notwithstanding an "entire agreement" clause in the lease, IPC had given a collateral warranty that the tie would be released. The court held that the clause in the lease confirming that it constituted the entire agreement deprived the alleged warranty of all legal effect, rendered it inadmissible, and was not in breach of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s.3.
SUMMARY I applied for an injunction to restrain E from breaking a beer tie contained in its lease and for an account of damages for breach of the clause. E counterclaimed that, notwithstanding an "entire agreement" clause in the lease, I had given a collateral warranty that the tie would be released. E had relied upon the undertaking given by I to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry that the number of pubs owned by I, which were subject to a tie in agreement, would be restricted by 1992 and, that all pubs still under I's ownership would be released from the tie by 1998.
HELD giving judgment for I and dismissing the counterclaim, that the "entire agreement" clause contained in the lease not only had the effect of rendering evidence of the alleged collateral warranty inadmissible, but also deprived the warranty of all legal effect, Deepak Fertilisers & Petrochemicals Corp Ltd v Davy McKee (London) Ltd [1998] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 139 applied. Further, the agreement clause was not in breach of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s.3 which was inapplicable to a contractual provision which defined where the terms of the contract were to be found, McGrath v Shah (1989) 57 P. & C.R. 452 applied. In any event, the reference to a release from the tie in 1991 was insufficient to support the giving of the alleged collateral warranty to E which, owing to the passage of time, would have been invalid at the time of the execution of the agreement.

SUMMARY Conditions and warranties; verbal condition overriding written condition
SUMMARY A printed condition in a catalogue protecting the vendor from personal liability in the case of any error of description can be overridden by a condition or warranty orally expressed on the basis of which the contract is made. The plaintiff purchased two heifers at an auction sale which were described in the catalogue as "unserved". The catalogue contained the following condition: "The lots are sold with all faults, imperfections, and errors of description". Another condition stated that the accuracy of the information was not guaranteed and that no compensation would be paid for any errors of description. Before the sale the plaintiff asked the defendant as well as his auctioneer: "Can you confirm heifers unserved." and received from both the answer: "Yes". Two months later a six months' old foetus was removed from one of the heifers which died as a result of carrying a calf at too young an age. Held, the catalogue expressly protected the vendor in the event of an error of description and the plaintiff could not succeed so far as his action was based on the catalogue. However, the question and answer amounted to an oral offer of warranty which overrode the stultifying condition in the printed terms and that offer was accepted by the plaintiff when he bid and the contract was made on that basis when the lot was knocked down to him.

SUMMARY Covenant; breach of covenant; forfeiture; waiver
SUMMARY By a lease dated April 5, 1944, the landlords let premises to the tenant, the tenant covenanting not to use the premises except as a shop. To the knowledge of the landlords, the tenant slept on the premises from time to time. In 1947 the draft of a new lease containing a covenant by the tenant "to use the demised premises as and for showrooms, workrooms and offices only," and not to permit the premises to be used for sleeping, was sent to the tenant. The tenant objected to the last part of the clause, and the landlords told the tenant orally that if he signed the lease the landlords would not object to his continuing to reside on the premises, and the completed lease omitted any reference to sleeping on the premises. The landlords subsequently brought an action for forfeiture of the lease on the ground of breach of covenant and the tenant counterclaimed for rectification.
HELD (1) having regard to the nature of the property and to the covenant to use it for showrooms, etc., only, the tenant by using it for residential purposes was in breach of covenant and the counterclaim for rectification failed; (2) although the landlords' knowledge waived past breaches, that knowledge did not amount to a release by them of the covenant; (3) the claim for forfeiture failed because the tenant had executed the lease in reliance on a promise made to him by the landlords at the time not to enforce against him personally the covenant to use the premises for business purposes only, and thus an enforceable contract had been constituted from which the landlords could not resile.

SUMMARY Exemption clause; printed conditions; oral promise
SUMMARY Where printed conditions in a contract are repugnant to a binding oral promise they do not provide exemption from liability for breach of that promise. A Co. had acted as forwarding agents for E Co., who were importers of machines from Italy, since 1959. Until 1967 the machines were packed in crates and always shipped under deck. In that year it was proposed to use containers in the future. A gave E an oral assurance that if containers were used they would be shipped under deck. On the faith of that promise E agreed a new contract with A, incorporating the standard conditions of the forwarding trade for the carriage of an injection-moulding machine in a container. As a result of an oversight the container was shipped on deck. The ship met a swell and the container was lost overboard. E claimed damages for the loss alleging breach of the contract with A. A contended that there was no contractual promise that the goods would be carried under deck or, alternatively, that the printed terms and conditions exempted them from liability thereunder. The judge dismissed the action. E appealed.
HELD allowing the appeal, that (1) the oral assurance amounted to an enforceable contractual promise; (2) the oral promise overrode the printed conditions. (Dictum of Lord Denning M.R. in Mendelssohn v Normand [1970] 1 Q.B. 177 applied).

SUMMARY Negligence; negligent mis-statement; duty of care; special relationship in pre-contract negotiations
SUMMARY Where a special relationship exists, a negligent mis-statement may be not only a breach of contractual warranty, but also an actionable tort as a breach of the duty of care which exists throughout pre-contractual negotiations and which survives the making of the ultimate contract. Esso granted a tenancy of a new filling station to D. During negotiations they told him that they estimated an annual "throughput" of petrol at 200,000 gallons a year by the third year. Due to the physical characteristics and layout of the site, the figure after three years was still under 100,000. D lost all his money. He entered into a new tenancy with Esso at a reduced rent plus a surcharge on petrol sold. The losses continued and D was unable to pay cash for the petrol. Esso cut off his supplies and eventually he had to surrender possession. He counterclaimed for breach of warranty, and for negligent misrepresentation.
HELD (1) the statement as to potential throughput was a contractual warranty, and the plaintiffs were liable for damages for its breach; (2) the statement was a negligent representation made by a party holding himself out as having special expertise in circumstances where a duty of care existed to take care that it was correct; (3) the measure of damage in both cases was the same, i.e. what D had lost by being induced to enter into the contract, which should be assessed on the same lines as damages for personal injuries to include estimated loss of earnings.

SUMMARY Sale of ship; description of future goods
SUMMARY Even if a strict and technical view must be taken as regards the description of unascertained future goods, such as commodities, other contracts for the sale of goods should be treated like other contracts generally and a particular item in a description will only be treated as a condition if it constitutes a substantial ingredient of the "identity" of the thing sold. A Japanese tanker was chartered in order to finance building before work started. The charterparty referred to the vessel as one to be built at Osaka, hull number 354. Because of its size it was eventually built at Oshima, hull number 004. Its physical attributes conformed with those required under the charter. Then due to the oil crisis the market collapsed. The charterers rejected the vessel on the ground that, by analogy with contracts for the sale of goods, the vessel did not comply with its contractual description.
HELD some of the cases on description in sale of goods were excessively technical; they should not be extended and were due for fresh examination. The hull and yard number had no special significance and could not be treated as a condition. In any event, the words were never part of the description, they were there merely to identify the vessel, which was the one contracted for.

SUMMARY Investors Compensation Scheme; home income plans; investors had validly assigned right to sue building society in damages but retained right to seek rescission of mortgage
SUMMARY On the advice of financial advisers, a number of home owners entered into home income plans involving the mortgaging of their homes with W, which caused the investors severe loss when economic conditions deteriorated. The investors claimed compensation from ICS by completing a claim form and ICS brought proceedings against W and numerous law firms involved in the mortgages, whilst some of the investors commenced separate actions against W for rescission of the mortgages and damages. The claim form stated that the investors had assigned absolutely to ICS all third party claims except "any claim (whether sounding in rescission for undue influence or otherwise) that you have against the...society in which you claim an abatement of sums which you would otherwise have to repay to the society...". ICS appealed against a Court of Appeal decision that the investors had not validly assigned their right to sue W in damages to ICS.
HELD allowing the appeal, that on the proper construction of the claim form, particularly in the light of the accompanying explanatory note, it was clear that all claims for damages and compensation by the investors had been validly assigned to ICS, such that the investors were not entitled to maintain their claims against W, but ICS could validly maintain them. The investors retained the right to seek rescission of their mortgages on whatever terms the court saw fit, as the right to seek rescission was not assignable as a chose in action, but was a right which attached to the mortgaged property and could only be enforced by the owner of the property. Similarly, the possibility of an abatement of the debt as part of the process of rescission was not an assignable chose in action, and so did not reduce the scope of the chose in action which had been assigned to ICS. The fact that the quantum of damages recovered by ICS might be affected by whether or not the investors managed to secure rescission of their mortgages did not mean that the investors had tried to assign different remedies in respect of the same chose in action.

SUMMARY Exclusion clause; whether fair and reasonable; approach of appellate court
SUMMARY Although conditions of a contract for sale of goods may strictly limit liability, the question is whether it would be "fair or reasonable" to rely on them within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. P ordered late cabbage seed from D who were seed merchants. The conditions of sale limited D's liability to the replacement or refund of the value of the seed. The seed proved utterly wrong for the purposes it was required, was not late cabbage and was unmerchantable. The value of the seed was GBP 207.60; the loss to P was approximately GBP 61,000.
HELD dismissing D's appeal, that although the conditions did limit their liability under contract, reliance on the conditions would not be fair and reasonable within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s.55 .

SUMMARY BC appealed against a ruling that although the general language used in an ACAS COT3 settlement agreement signed by N, a former employee of BC, was sufficient to include potential claims not at that time known or identified, it would be unconscionable for BC to rely upon it. After the agreement had been signed, N had sought to pursue a "stigma" claim against BC based on the breach of implied duty not to carry on a corrupt business. Finding that the clause could not be read literally, the court held that neither party could realistically have anticipated N's claim and that on an equitable construction of their agreement, it was impossible to conclude, in the absence of an express indication, that they intended the agreement to extend to the release of rights which they could never have contemplated or foreseen.
SUMMARY BCCI appealed against a decision ([2000] 3 All E.R. 51) that although the general language used in an ACAS COT3 settlement agreement signed by N, a former employee of BCCI, was sufficient to include potential claims not at that time known or identified, it would be unconscionable for BCCI to rely upon it. The agreements had been entered into by the redundant employees of BCCI in full and final settlement of all or any claims that existed or might exist against BCCI. After the agreement had been signed, N had sought to pursue a "stigma" claim against BCCI based on the breach of implied duty not to carry on a corrupt business, which he contended had handicapped him in his applications for other employment.

ABSTRACT The appellant developer (P) appealed against a decision ( [2008] EWCA Civ 183, [2008] 2 All E.R. (Comm) 387 ) in favour of the respondent (C) concerning the interpretation of an agreement to develop C's land.
ABSTRACT Under the agreement P was to obtain planning permission, construct a development on the site and then sell the properties. The price payable by P under the agreement included an "Additional Residential Payment" (ARP) defined as "23.4% of the price achieved for each Residential Unit in excess of the Minimum Guaranteed Residential Unit Value less the Costs and Incentives". The judge at first instance and the Court of Appeal agreed with C's interpretation of the definition of the ARP.
ABSTRACT P's argument, if it failed on the construction issue, was that the House should take into account the pre-contractual negotiations. P submitted that the rule in Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 W.L.R. 1381 that pre-contractual negotiations were inadmissible in construing a contract was illogical and prevented a court from putting itself in the position of the parties and ascertaining their true intent. P also submitted that the judge and the Court of Appeal had misunderstood the principles on which rectification could be decreed.
SUMMARY Their Lordships indicated, in obiter dicta, that there was no clearly established case for revisiting the rule in Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 W.L.R. 1381 that pre-contractual negotiations were inadmissible in construing a contract; furthermore, Partenreederei MS Karen Oltmann v Scarsdale Shipping Co (The Karen Oltmann) [1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 708 was an illegitimate extension of the "private dictionary" principle which, taken to its logical conclusion, would destroy the exclusionary rule and any advantages which it might have.
HELD Appeal allowed.
HELD (1) Lawrence Collins L.J. below had rightly concluded that P had demonstrated that something had gone wrong with the language in the contract. To interpret the definition of the ARP in accordance with ordinary rules of syntax made no commercial sense. The ARP had to mean the amount by which 23.4 per cent of the achieved price exceeded the minimum guaranteed residential unit value. There was no limit to the amount of "red ink" or verbal rearrangement or correction which the court was allowed when determining whether there was a clear mistake. All that was required was that it should be clear that something had gone wrong with the language and that it should be clear what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant, Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society (No.1) [1998] 1 W.L.R. 896 , East v Pantiles (Plant Hire) [1982] 2 E.G.L.R. 111 and KPMG v Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 363, [2007] Bus. L.R. 1336 applied. Both of those requirements were satisfied in the instant case. (2) (Obiter) (a) It would not be inconsistent with the English objective theory of contractual interpretation to admit evidence of previous communications between the parties as part of the background which might cast light on what they meant by the language they used. Prima facie, pre-contractual negotiations were potentially relevant background, Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (In Liquidation) v Ali (No.1) [2001] UKHL 8, [2002] 1 A.C. 251 considered. However, such material would usually be inadmissible because it was irrelevant to the question before the court, namely what the parties would reasonably be taken to have meant by the language eventually used in the agreement. There was no clearly established case for departing from the exclusionary rule, even though it might mean that in some cases parties would be bound by a contract in terms which, upon a full investigation of the course of negotiations, a reasonable observer would not have taken them to have intended, Prenn considered. There was a power to depart from the rule, but that power was only intended to be applied in a small number of cases in which previous decisions of the House were thought to be impeding the proper development of the law or to have led to results which were unjust or contrary to public policy, Jones v Secretary of State for Social Services [1972] A.C. 944 considered; (b) Evidence could be adduced that the parties to a contract habitually used words in an unconventional sense in order to support an argument that words in the contract should bear a similar unconventional meaning (the "private dictionary" principle). However, the decision in Partenreederei MS Karen Oltmann v Scarsdale Shipping Co (The Karen Oltmann) [1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 708 , which involved a choice between two perfectly conventional meanings of the word "after", was an illegitimate extension of the "private dictionary" principle which, taken to its logical conclusion, would destroy the exclusionary rule and any advantages which it might have, The Karen Oltmann considered. (3) (Obiter) Joscelyne v Nissen [1970] 2 Q.B. 86 extended the availability of rectification to cases where there had not been any enforceable prior agreement, Joscelyne considered. In considering rectification, the question was what an objective observer would have thought the parties' intentions were, Frederick E Rose (London) Ltd v William H Pim Junior & Co Ltd [1953] 2 Q.B. 450 and Etablissements Levy (Georges et Paul) v Adderley Navigation Co Panama SA (The Olympic Pride) [1980] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 67 considered. Evidence as to what terms a party understood to have been agreed could be significant in a case where the prior consensus was based on oral exchanges or conduct, but where the prior consensus was expressed entirely in writing such evidence was likely to carry very little weight, Carmichael v National Power Plc [1999] 1 W.L.R. 2042 and George Cohen Sons & Co Ltd v Docks and Inland Waterways Executive (1950) 84 Ll. L. Rep. 97 considered. However, it would not be inadmissible. In the instant case, on the assumption that the judge was right in his construction of the ARP definition, both parties were mistaken in thinking that it reflected their prior consensus, so P was entitled to rectification.

CATEGORY Contracts Other Related Subjects: Company Law; Articles of Association; Belize; Directors; Implied Terms; Interpretation; Vacation of Office
FLAGS Criticised
ABSTRACT The appellants (X) appealed against a decision of the Court of Appeal of Belize on the construction of an article in the articles of association of a company (B) which had been formed to take over the undertaking of the Belize Telecommunications Authority.
ABSTRACT The article provided as follows: "The holder of the Special Share shall so long as it is the holder of C Ordinary shares amounting to 37.5% or more of the issued share capital of the Company be entitled at any time by written notice served upon the Company to appoint two of the Directors designated C Directors and by like notice to remove any Director so appointed and appoint another in his or her place". The first respondent (R) acquired from the Belize Government the special share referred to in the article and a majority of the issued share capital. It appointed eight directors, including two special C directors. R pledged the ordinary shares to the Government to secure borrowings which had financed the purchase. Within less than a year, however, it defaulted on its obligations. Pursuant to the pledge agreement, the Government took back a substantial number of the ordinary shares. The result was that R was left with the special share and C shares amounting to less than 37.5 per cent of the issued share capital. The question which then arose was whether the two special C directors appointed by R remained members of the board. Under the articles, the only person who had the power to remove them was the person who would have had the power to appoint them, namely a special shareholder holding C shares amounting to 37.5 per cent of the issued share capital. But the result of R's default was that no such person existed, nor was there any express provision in the articles that in such circumstances a special C director vacated office. The Court of Appeal rejected X's contention that the articles should be construed as providing by implication that a director appointed by virtue of a specified shareholding would vacate his office if there was no longer any holder of such a shareholding.
SUMMARY In every case in which it was said that some provision ought to be implied in a contract, the question for the court would be whether such a provision would spell out in express words what the contract, read against the relevant background, would reasonably be understood to mean.
HELD Appeal allowed.
HELD (1) It was appropriate to make some general observations about the process of implying terms into a contract. The proposition that the implication of a term was an exercise in the construction of the relevant instrument as a whole was not only a matter of logic (as a court had no power to alter what the instrument meant) but also well supported by authority. In every case in which it was said that some provision ought to be implied in an instrument, the question for the court would be whether such a provision would spell out in express words what the instrument, read against the relevant background, would reasonably be understood to mean. It would be noticed from Lord Pearson's speech in Trollope & Colls Ltd v North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board [1973] 1 W.L.R. 601 that that question could be reformulated in various ways which a court might find helpful in providing an answer - the implied term had to "go without saying", it had to be "necessary to give business efficacy to the contract" and so on - but those were not to be treated as different or additional tests. There was only one question, namely what the instrument, read as a whole against the relevant background, would reasonably be understood to mean. In BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings 180 C.L.R. 266, Lord Simon of Glaisdale had said that the following conditions had to be met before a term could be implied: it had to be reasonable and equitable; it had to be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term would be implied if the contract was effective without it; it had to be so obvious that "it [went] without saying"; it had to be capable of clear expression; further, it had not to contradict any express term of the contract. That list was best regarded, not as series of independent tests which had each to be surmounted, but rather as a collection of different ways in which judges had tried to express the central idea that the proposed implied term had to spell out what the contract actually meant, or in which they had explained why they did not think that it did so, Trollope, BP Refinery, Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman [2002] 1 A.C. 408 and Moorcock, The (1889) 14 P.D. 64 considered. (2) The Court of Appeal had been wrong not to imply the term argued for by X into the article. The implication was required to avoid defeating what appeared to have been the overriding purpose of the machinery of appointment and removal of directors, namely to ensure that the board reflected the appropriate shareholder interests in accordance with the scheme laid out in the articles.

SUMMARY Implied obligations; liability in tower-blocks; maintenance of common parts
SUMMARY Where the landlords of multi-storey dwellings retain control of the common parts of the buildings, there is by necessary implication an obligation on them to take reasonable care to maintain the common stairs and their lighting, the lifts and communal rubbish chutes in reasonable repair, and that obligation can only be avoided by express exclusion in the contract of letting. In an action brought by the council for possession of a maisonette on the ninth floor of a 15- storey tower block, the tenants, who had withheld rent in protest against the appalling state of repair of, in particular, the lifts and staircases in the building, counterclaimed for damages for breach of a duty to repair and maintain the common parts of the building. The council had made repeated efforts at considerable expense to keep the lifts in working order and to provide safe access to the maisonettes but their efforts had been frustrated by incessant vandalism. The county court judge awarded nominal damages for breach of an implied duty to keep the common parts in repair. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held, Lord Denning M.R. dissenting, that there was no such duty. On appeal to the House of Lords, held, allowing the appeal, that where an essential means of access to units in a building was retained in the landlord's occupation, then unless the obligation to maintain them was clearly placed on the tenants, the nature of the contract and circumstances required that it should be placed on the landlord. The obligation, however, was to take reasonable care to keep the means of access in reasonable repair and usability with the recognition that the tenants had the responsibilities of a reasonable set of tenants, and there had not been shown to be any breach of such obligation by the council.

SUMMARY Contract of employment; incorporating statutory superannuation scheme; failure to inform employees of rights; whether implied term requiring notification of such rights; whether claims time barred
SUMMARY Where the terms of an employee's contract had not been negotiated with the individual employee but resulted from negotiations with a representative body or were otherwise incorporated by reference, and a particular term of the contract made available to the employee a valuable right contingent upon his taking action to avail himself of its benefit and the employee could not reasonably be expected to be aware of the term, it was an implied term of the contract that the employer was under an obligation to take reasonable steps to bring the term in question to the employee's attention. Ps were medical practitioners employed by Ds in Northern Ireland under contracts of employment which incorporated the regulations from time to time in force governing superannuation rights and liabilities of persons employed in the Health Service. Under the 1962 Regulations an employee had to complete 40 years' contributory service to qualify for a full pension. The 1974 Regulations gave employees the right to purchase "added years" on certain terms, to qualify for a full pension. The right was exercisable within 12 months of February 10, 1975, by persons already employed and within 12 months by persons taking up employment thereafter. There was a discretion to extend the 12-month time limit and to vary the terms of purchase when the time limit was extended. The 1983 Regulations removed this discretion and substituted a new less favourable right to purchase. Ps were not given notice of their right to purchase "added years" and accordingly failed to take up their rights before the 1983 Regulations came into force. Ps brought claims against Ds claiming an implied breach of contract and breach of statutory duty under s.4(1) of the 1965 Act. At trial the claims based on breach of statutory duty were abandoned. The judge dismissed the other claims. The Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland permitted Ps to revive the claims based on breach of statutory duty and allowed the appeal.
HELD dismissing Ds' appeal, that (1) where the terms of an employee's contract of employment had not been negotiated with the individual employee but resulted from negotiations with a representative body or were otherwise incorporated by reference, and a particular term of the contract made available to the employee a valuable right contingent upon his taking action to avail himself of its benefit and the employee could not, in all the circumstances, reasonably be expected to be aware of the term unless it was drawn to his attention, it was an implied term of the contract that the employer was under an obligation to take reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the employee. Accordingly, there was such an implied term in Ps' contract of which Ds were in breach; (2) the actions were not time-barred because Ds had been in breach of a continuing obligation to bring the right to purchase "added years" to Ps' attention under the 1974 Regulations until they were superseded by the 1983 Regulations. Per curiam: a breach by an employer of the duty imposed by s.4(1) of the 1965 Act to give an employee written particulars of the terms of his employment is remediable only by recourse to an industrial tribunal as provided by s.5 and confers no civil right of action in the employee founding in damages.

SUMMARY It was not an implied term of every contract of employment that an employer ought to take reasonable care of an employee's economic well being.
SUMMARY C appealed against a decision dismissing his claim for damages for breach of an implied term of his contract of employment with F. C was a senior employee and director of F. Under his contract of employment he was entitled, if absent from work due to illness, to be paid his full salary for up to six months' absence and thereafter such remuneration as the board of F might in its discretion allow. He was a member of F's long term disability insurance scheme, under which he was entitled, so long as he remained an employee of F, to the payment of benefits in the event that he was "totally unable by reason of sickness....to follow his occupation", and thereafter to payment of such benefits as the scheme's insurer might think fit. C suffered a nervous breakdown which rendered him unfit for further work and he consequently submitted a claim under the scheme. Terms were discussed between C and F in relation to C's retirement, as a result of which C wrote a letter, in terms suggested by F, in which he tendered his resignation with effect from June 1997. As a consequence of that letter C ceased to be entitled under the scheme to payments of benefit as of right after June 1997, and the scheme insurer only continued to make discretionary payments until June 1998. C sought damages representing past and future loss of benefit on the basis that F had acted in breach of an implied term of his contract of employment to take reasonable care of C's economic well being by (i) asking him to submit a resignation letter knowing the effect that that would have on C's right to benefits under the scheme, or (ii) failing to warn him of the effect that the letter would have on his entitlement to those benefits.
HELD dismissing the appeal, that the judge had been right to reject the proposition that it was an implied term of every contract of employment that an employer ought to take reasonable care of an employee's economic well being. In deciding whether such a term was to be implied, it was better to focus on questions of reasonableness, fairness and the balancing of competing policy considerations rather than on the elusive concept of "necessity". The implication of such a term would introduce a major extension of the relevant law, when in the recent decisions of Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board [1992] 1 A.C. 294 and Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc [1995] 2 A.C. 296 the House of Lords had refused to do so. Secondly, such an implied term would impose an unfair and unreasonable burden upon employers, Scally , Spring , University of Nottingham v Eyett (No.1) [1999] 2 All E.R. 437 and Hagen v ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd [2002] I.R.L.R. 31 applied, Outram v Academy Plastics Ltd [2001] I.C.R. 367 considered, Reid v Rush & Tompkins Group [1990] 1 W.L.R. 212 doubted. On the evidence, it was clear that C had decided to retire on his own initiative. F had not caused or contributed to that decision. It was equally clear that F was reasonably entitled to conclude that C knew, or reasonably had open to him the means of finding out, the terms of the scheme, including those as to cessation of the right to benefit on termination of employment.

SUMMARY Carriage by sea; charterparty; warranty of seaworthiness
SUMMARY By a time charterparty, charterers hired a ship ". . . she being in every way fitted for ordinary cargo service." The owners were to "maintain her in a thoroughly efficient state in hull and machinery during service." The ship was delivered to the charterers in February 1957 in reasonably good condition, but chiefly owing to an inadequate engine room staff, there were serious breakdowns on the first voyage, resulting in lengthy delays and considerable expense on repairs. In June 1957, the charterers, who had no reasonable grounds for thinking that the vessel could be made seaworthy before September 1957, repudiated the contract. The ship was in fact made thoroughly seaworthy by the middle of September, and the owners sued the charterers for wrongful repudiation of the charterparty. Salmon, J. held that the owners were entitled to damages. The charterers appealed.
HELD although the owners were admittedly in breach of their obligation to deliver a seaworthy ship, seaworthiness was not a condition of the charterparty the breach of which entitled the charterers at once to repudiate; since, therefore, the delays caused by the breakdowns and repairs were not sufficient for the contract to be frustrated, the charterers' claim failed and the appeal must be dismissed. Havelock v Geddes (1809) 10 Ea. 555 applied; Davidson v Gwynne 104 E.R. 149 applied; Tarrabochia v Hickie 156 E.R. 1168 applied; J&E Kish v Charles Taylor & Sons & Co [1912] A.C. 604 applied; Jackson v Union Marine Insurance Co Ltd (1874-75) L.R. 10 C.P. 125 considered; Universal Cargo Carriers Corp v Citati (No.1) [1957] 1 W.L.R. 979 approved and applied. Per Diplock, L.J.: The shipowner's undertaking to deliver a seaworthy ship is neither a "condition" nor a "warranty" but one of that large class of contractual undertakings one breach of which may have the same effect as that ascribed to a breach of "condition" under the Sale of Goods Act 1893 and a different breach of which may have only the same effect as that ascribed to a breach of "warranty" under that Act.

SUMMARY Terms; notice of readiness to load; whether notice given in time
SUMMARY In general, time is of the essence in a mercantile contract, and a term as to time of performance of an obligation by one party as a condition precedent to the performance of an obligation by the other party will generally be treated as a condition. By a contract dated January 30, 1974, buyers agreed to purchase 15,000 tons of soya bean meal, shipment to take place in consignments of 5,000 tons in May, June and July 1975. By cl.7 of the Grain and Feed Trade Association Ltd.'s standard form contract 119, which was incorporated, it was provided that "Period of delivery during May 1975 at buyers' call. Buyers shall give at least 15 days' notice of probable readiness of vessel." The buyers gave notice under cl.8 extending the period for delivery to one calendar month. The last day upon which the sellers could ship the goods therefore became June 30, 1975, and the last day for the buyers to give notice was June 12. The buyers did not give notice until June 17. The judge held that the term as to the time for giving notice was not a condition and that in any event there had been no breach. The Court of Appeal allowed the sellers' appeal. On appeal to the House of Lords, held, that, in general, time was of the essence in a mercantile contract; in such a contract, where a term had to be performed by one party as a condition precedent to the ability of the other party to perform another term, especially an essential term such as the nomination of a single loading port, the term as to time for performance of the former obligation would in general fall to be treated as a condition. cl.7 was a condition since until notice was given the sellers could not know which loading port to nominate ( Hongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd (The Hongkong Fir) [1962] 2 Q.B. 26 and United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC [1978] A.C. 904 considered; Toprak Mahsulleri Ofisi v Finagrain Compagnie Commerciale Agricole et Financiere SA [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 98 approved).

SUMMARY Breach of condition
SUMMARY In a hire-purchase agreement, when the hirer has himself previously seen and examined the goods and made application for hire-purchase on the basis of his inspection of them, there is an obligation on the lender to deliver the goods in substantially the same condition as when they were seen, and it makes no difference that the lender is a finance company which has bought the goods in the interval without seeing them. The lender must know, from the ordinary course of business, that the hirer applies on the faith of his inspection and on the understanding that the goods will be delivered in substantially the same condition, and it is an implied term of the agreement that pending delivery the goods will be kept in suitable order and repair for the purposes of the bailment. Nor can the lender rely on an exempting clause if he delivers something "different in kind" from that contracted for, or if he breaks a "fundamental term" or a "fundamental contractual obligation": in other words, a breach which goes to the root of the contract disentitles the party in breach from relying on an exempting clause. S. showed the defendant a second-hand Buick car. The defendant found it to be in excellent condition and decided to buy it, but as he had not the money to pay the price asked he arranged to buy it through M F, Ltd, a hire-purchase finance company, whose forms the defendant duly completed. In due course the forms were submitted to M F, Ltd, through the plaintiff company. M F, Ltd accepted the application, and the transaction was concluded by the plaintiff company buying the car from S and reselling it to M F, Ltd, and by M F, Ltd then letting it out an hire-purchase terms to the defendant. These terms provided, inter alia: "No condition or warranty that the vehicle is roadworthy, or as to its age, condition or fitness for any purpose is given by the owner or implied herein." When S delivered the car to the defendant it was in a deplorable condition and would not go, and he refused to accept it. It was then towed away to S's premises. M F, Ltd assigned their rights under the agreement to the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs brought proceedings against the defendant to recover unpaid hiring charges, interest and damages. The defendant by his defence admitted the agreement between himself and M F, Ltd, but claimed that it was a term and condition, express or implied, thereof that the car to be hired thereunder should correspond with the car submitted by S.
HELD the lender was in breach of the implied obligation to deliver the car in substantially the same condition as when the defendant saw it first, and, that breach going to the root of the contract, the lender was not entitled to rely on the exemption clause in the agreement, so that he was not entitled to succeed; in any case, when goods are let on hire-purchase and there is a refusal by the hirer to take them, the proper remedy is damages for failure to accept delivery, and, since the assignment by M F, Ltd to the plaintiff did not cover a claim for damages, the plaintiff company was on that ground debarred from succeeding.

SUMMARY Exclusion clause; fundamental breach
SUMMARY The so-called doctrine of fundamental breach does not operate so as to prevent reliance upon an exclusion of liability clause upon the contract being brought to an end. The defendants contracted with the plaintiffs to provide a night- patrol service at the latter's factory premises. The contract excluded liability on the defendants' part for "any injurious act or default of any employee of the (defendants) unless such act or default could have been foreseen and avoided by the exercise of due diligence on the part of the employer; nor in any event shall the company be held responsible for any loss suffered through fire or any other cause except in so far as is solely attributable to the negligence of the company's employees acting within the cause of their employment." One of the defendants' employees who had been satisfactorily employed by them for some three months deliberately started a small fire in the factory, the fire getting out of control and burning down the factory. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge's ruling that the defendants could rely upon the contract as excluding their liability.
HELD allowing the defendants' appeal, that whether an exclusion clause was apt to exclude or limit liability was a matter of construction of the contract; that the fact that a breach may be such as to justify the innocent party in terminating or treating as repudiated the contract did not mean that the terms of the contract in so far as they governed liability were not to be enforced; that, generally, parties to a contract, when they bargained on equal terms, should be at liberty to apportion liability in the contract as they saw fit; and that the wording of the exclusion clause in the instant case was adequate to exclude liability for what occurred.

SUMMARY Exemption clause
SUMMARY The duty of a court in approaching the consideration of clauses which purport to exempt one party to a contract from liability may be summarised as follows: 1. If the clause contains language which expressly exempts A, the person in whose favour it is made, from the consequence of the negligence of his own servants, effect must be given to that provision. 2. If there is no express reference to negligence, the court must consider whether the words used are wide enough, in their ordinary meaning, to cover negligence on the part of the servants of A. If a doubt arises at this point, it must be resolved against A. 3. If the words used are wide enough for the above purpose, the court must then consider whether the head of damage may be based on some ground other than that of negligence. The other ground must not be so fanciful or remote that A cannot be supposed to have desired protection against it; but, subject to this qualification, the existence of a possible head of damage other than that of negligence is fatal to A even if the words used are, prima facie, wide enough to cover negligence on the part of his servants. The appellants, a Quebec company, presented a petition of right against the Crown, alleging that a fire in a freight shed occupied by the appellants under a lease from the Crown was caused by the negligence of the Crown's servants and that goods to the value of half a million dollars, of which 40,000 dollars-worth of goods belonged to the appellant and the remainder to others, were destroyed. The fire occurred when servants of the Crown were doing repairs in the shed at the request of the appellants. Part of the work consisted of drilling a hole in a steel beam and for this purpose an oxy-acetylene cutting torch was used instead of a hand drill. Sparks from the torch fell on some bales of cotton waste in the shed and started a fire which destroyed the shed and all its contents. In answer to the petition the Crown denied negligence but alleged that, if they were guilty of negligence, cl. 7 of the lease exempted them from any liability to the appellants. Cl. 7 provided: "That the lessee shall not have any claim or demand against the lessor for . . . damage . . . to the said shed.. . or to any . . . goods . . . at any time . . . being . . . in the said shed." The Crown also brought in the appellants as third parties to the petition of six other petitioners who had suffered loss in the fire, alleging that if the Crown were guilty of negligence the appellants were liable to indemnify the Crown against the consequences of its negligence under cl. 17 which provided: "That the lessee shall at all times indemnify . . . the lessor from and against all claims and demands loss costs damages actions suits or other proceedings. . . in any manner based upon occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these presents or any action. . . done. . . by virtue hereof . . ." It was shown that by the law of Quebec the lessor would be liable for damage to the shed without any negligence on his part if such damage were caused by an inherent defect in the shed, by the operations of a third party on adjacent land, or by the act of a trespasser. Held, (1) under cl. 7 the Crown had failed to limit its liability in respect of negligence in clear terms; (2) even if the words in cl. 17 "any action done by virtue hereof" could be applied to a negligent act done in the course of carrying out an obligation, the head of damage might be based on some ground other than that of negligence, and, for this reason and also because the Crown had failed to impose on the appellants in clear terms the burdensome obligation of an indemnity for the whole of the damage by the Crown however negligent its servants might be, the Crown's claim for an indemnity under cl. 17 also failed.

SUMMARY Conditions and warranties; exemption clause; course of dealing
SUMMARY Three or four transactions in five years are probably not enough to establish a course of dealing. P telephoned D's garage and asked if they would repair his car. D's manager said that they would if P had it towed to the garage. While in the garage the car was damaged by a fire which started as a result of the garage's negligence. On three or four occasions in the previous five years P had had repairs carried out at the garage and on each of those occasions had signed a form which, under the place for signature, stated "The Company is not responsible for damage caused by fire to customer's cars on the premises." In an action by P claiming damages for negligence, D contended that, although P had not signed the form on this occasion, the exemption clause thereon had been incorporated in the oral contract between them by a course of dealing, and that its effect was to exclude liability for negligently causing a fire while P's car was in their care.
HELD that D were liable to P for their negligence because (1) they had not established a course of dealing and so the clause was not incorporated into the oral contract; and (2) even if it had been, the wording of the clause was not sufficiently plain to exclude liability for negligence. Per Salmon, L.J. In order to establish that a term has been implied into a contract by a course of dealing, it is not essential to show that the party charged had actual and not merely constructive knowledge of the term and with such actual knowledge had in fact assented to it. (Dictum of Denning, L.J. in Olley v Marlborough Court Ltd [1948] 1 All E.R. 955 applied, dicta of Scrutton, L.J. in Rutter v Palmer [1922] 2 K.B. 87 explained; and of Lord Greene M.R. in Alderslade v Hendon Laundry Ltd [1945] K.B. 189 explained; Turner v Civil Service Supply Association Ltd [1926] 1 K.B. 50 overruled and Fagan v Green & Edwards Ltd [1926] 1 K.B. 102 overruled; dictum of Lord Devlin in McCutcheon v David MacBrayne Ltd [1964] 1 W.L.R. 125 disapproved).

SUMMARY A misrepresentation of law was actionable in the light of the House of Lords decision in Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council [1999] 2 A.C. 349, as a judge at first instance was bound to refuse to apply previous decisions that otherwise would be binding if they were inconsistent, although not expressly overruled, with a subsequent decision of the House of Lords.
SUMMARY P sought to recover damages for misrepresentation from H following the sale of commercial property used as a car park by NCP. The land in question had been licensed to NCP pursuant to an agreement in 1988. The terms upon which the property was occupied satisfied all the requirements prescribed by Street v Mountford [1985] A.C. 809, namely exclusive possession for a term at a rent with the effect that a business tenancy agreement was created pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. Although aware of the likelihood that a tenancy existed, the sales documentation drawn up for an auction sale of the premises was careful to refer to the land in terms that suggested that only a licence agreement existed. H maintained that any misrepresentation was a misrepresentation as to law which was not actionable.
HELD giving judgment for the claimant in part, that on a proper construction of the representations made in the catalogue, H, by its agents, had represented that the arrangement between H and NCP had the legal character of a licence and was terminable on three months notice. In view of the fact that the true legal character of NCP's interest was a business tenancy protected under the 1954 Act there was a clear misrepresentation. The "misrepresentation of law" rule no longer existed following the decision of the House of Lords in Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council [1999] 2 A.C. 349 and accordingly the misrepresentation was actionable, Kleinwort considered. The terminology used had been deliberate with the aim of concealing the existence of a protected tenancy. P had been induced to purchase in reliance upon the representation and it had been reasonable for him so to rely.

ABSTRACT The appellant company (H) appealed against the Court of Appeal's decision that it could not recover damages arising from moneys lost in reliance on the credit reference given by the respondent bank (X) in respect of one of X's customers (E).
ABSTRACT H was an advertising agent who had placed substantial orders for advertising space for E, for which H was personally liable. H had then enquired of X as to the creditworthiness of E, and in reliance on the representations H refrained from cancelling the orders to relieve its personal liability. H became doubtful about the financial position of E, and it sought a further reference "without responsibility" from X. X's response to H, stated to be "for your private use and without responsibility on the part of the bank", was that E was considered good for its ordinary business engagements. After that communication, H lost money when E went into liquidation. H sought to recover the money lost by a claim in negligence against X. By authority binding upon them, both the judge at first instance and the Court of Appeal considered themselves driven to the conclusion that no such action could lie in the absence of a contract or fiduciary relationship, and that no special relationship involving a duty of care could be inferred.
SUMMARY In making a statement at the request of another, a duty of care would be owed by the representor to the inquirer if it was plain that in seeking information or advice from the representor the inquirer was reasonably trusting him to exercise such a degree of care as the circumstances required and the representor knew or ought to have known that the inquirer was doing so. If in those circumstances the representor gave information or advice which was negligent he would be liable for any pecuniary or personal damage caused to the inquirer, but where the representor had expressly excluded responsibility for reliance on his statement no liability arose.
HELD Appeal dismissed.
HELD (1) (Per Lord Reid) The principle in Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562 had no direct bearing on the instant case. Donoghue set out to reflect the standards of the reasonable man but reasonable people often stated opinions without taking care, so the law had to treat words and acts differently . It was clear that liability for negligent misstatement could not be founded on the Donoghue principle alone; something more was required, namely that the representor had expressly or impliedly undertaken responsibility for their statement, Donoghue considered. The decision in Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App. Cas. 337 had not established any universal rule that, in the absence of any contract, an innocent (not fraudulent) but negligent misrepresentation could not give rise to an action, Nocton v Lord Ashburton [1914] A.C. 932 applied, Derry considered. In the light of the decision in Robinson v National Bank of Scotland Ltd 1916 S.C. (H.L.) 154, concerning a duty of care arising from other "special relationships",there was no logical stopping place short of all those relationships where the party seeking the advice was reasonably trusting the other to exercise such a degree of care as the circumstances required, and where the representor knew or should reasonably have known that the inquirer would rely on him, Robinson applied, Candler v Crane Christmas & Co [1951] 2 K.B. 164 overruled, Le Lievre v Gould [1893] 1 Q.B. 491 not followed and Cann v Willson (1888) 39 Ch. D. 39 approved. The relevant question in the instant case was whether an undertaking to assume a duty to take care could be inferred. Since H's inquiry had been requested "without responsibility" from X, it was clear that no such duty could be inferred. (2) (Per Lord Morris) It should be regarded as settled that if someone possessed of a special skill undertook, irrespective of contract, to apply that skill for the assistance of another person who relied upon such skill, a duty of care should arise. That the service was given by words made no difference. Where a person was so placed that others could reasonably rely on his skill, and that person allowed his advice to be passed on to another whom he knew or should have known would rely on it, a duty of care also arose. (3) (Per Lord Hodson) A banker giving references as to credit-worthiness was not under a legal obligation to do more than to give honest answers to the best of his actual knowledge. However, in accordance with Lord Morris, where a person gave advice in the knowledge that it would reasonably be relied upon, a duty of care arose. (4) (Per Lord Devlin) The problem in issue was a by-product of the doctrine of consideration in English law. The special relationship required to establish a duty of care arose in relationships "equivalent to contract" where there was an assumption of responsibility which, but for the absence of consideration, would constitute a contract. The responsibility was not one implied by law, but one which was voluntarily accepted either generally where a general relationship was created or specifically in relation to a particular transaction. Where there was a general relationship (such as that of solicitor/client, banker/customer, although there were others yet to be established) it was unnecessary to prove any more than its existence, and the duty followed. Where a particular relationship was created ad hoc (as in the instant case) the facts had to be examined to see if there was an express or implied undertaking of responsibility. (5) (Per Lord Pearce) To import a duty of care, the relationship between the parties had normally to concern a business or professional transaction whose nature made clear the gravity of the inquiry.

SUMMARY Professional negligence; Auditors' report to shareholders; No duty of care owed to shareholders or investors
SUMMARY TR, a firm of accountants, appealed against a decision of the Court of Appeal (Times, August 5, 1988) that they owed a duty of care to shareholders when preparing an auditor's report as required by statute. C had brought an action against D and another, directors of F, a public company in respect of which the report had been prepared, alleging negligent misstatement. C had purchased shares in F as part of a take over bid and, placing reliance on TR's report, had bought further shares. The report was subsequently proved to have to given a false picture of F's profits and C suffered a loss. The Court of Appeal had drawn a distinction between existing shareholders, to whom TR owed a duty and potential investors in respect of whom no duty was owed. TR submitted that it did not owe a duty to either group, since the necessary degree of proximity between the parties was missing.
HELD allowing the appeal, that no duty was owed either to existing shareholders, or to potential investors, since for a duty to arise, three factors had to exist, namely: (1) a sufficient degree of proximity in the relationship between the parties; (2) the knowledge that the report would be communicated to the shareholder or investor in connection with a particular transaction in the contemplation of the parties, Smith v Eric S Bush (A Firm) [1990] 1 A.C. 831 applied, and (3) the shareholder or investor would place reliance on the report when deciding whether to enter into the relevant transaction. Auditors of a public company routinely preparing accounts, in contrast to the preparation of a report for a specific purpose for an identified party, owed no duty to the public at large who might place reliance on company accounts when making investment decisions. To impose such a liability would open the floodgates to an indeterminately wide class of people, JEB Fasteners Ltd v Marks Bloom & Co [1981] 3 All E.R. 289 distinguished. Furthermore, it was necessary to impose some limit on liability for economic loss arising in the absence of a contractual relationship between the parties.

SUMMARY Lloyd's underwriting agent; reliance by names on services; implied contractual terms of care and skill; whether tortious liability thereby excluded
SUMMARY Where a person undertakes to perform professional or quasi- professional services for another, this commitment, where relied upon by the person on whose behalf these services are performed, may be sufficient to give rise to a duty of care in tort, regardless of the contractual relationship between the parties. Members of certain Lloyd's syndicates brought an action against D, the underwriting agents who managed these syndicates, alleging that D had been negligent in the management of the syndicates. The relationships between the parties were governed by agency agreements, which contained implied terms as to the due care and skill to be exercised by D. The issues before the court were whether a duty of care in tort was owed, despite the contractual relationship between the parties, whether managing agents, who had been appointed as sub-agents by D owed such a duty of care and whether D were responsible for any lack of skill or care shown by the managing agents whom they had appointed. At first instance and appeal the issues were all decided in favour of P and D appealed to the House of Lords.
HELD dismissing D's appeal, that (1) the duty of exercising reasonable skill and care exists where a person undertakes to perform professional or quasi-professional services for another; (2) the undertaking of such duties, together with a reliance on them is sufficient to give rise to a duty of care in tort, unless this is precluded by contractual agreement between the parties; (3) D undertook to act as the underwriting agents of P and so were liable for any lack of skill or care on the part of the managing agents to whom they delegated their underwriting duties Hedley Byrne & Co v Heller & Partners [1964] A.C. 265, [1963] C.L.Y. 2416 applied; Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett Stubbs & Kemp [1979] Ch. 384 approved.

SUMMARY Fraudulent misrepresentation; damages; purchase of business
SUMMARY Damages for fraudulent misrepresentation are completely at large and extend to the limit of the loss actually suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the misrepresentation. Per curiam: wherever it can do so without injustice to the other party, the Court of Appeal will not allow a party to be prejudiced by errors on the part of his counsel at the trial. The plaintiff purchased an ironmongers' business from X. He did so on the strength of X's representations (a) as to the size of the weekly wages bill and (b) that all the trade was conducted from the shop. In fact both representations were false to the knowledge of X inasmuch as a part-time traveller was employed whose wages were not disclosed to the plaintiff and by whom half the trade of the business was conducted (ie, outside the shop). The plaintiff sued for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and for conspiracy. He succeeded, and on his counsel's submission the judge awarded GBP 1,500 damages, this sum being based on the cost of the services of a part-time traveller. On appeal by the plaintiff, held, allowing the appeal, (1) that the damages awarded had been calculated, erroneously, on the basis that they were damages for breach of contract; (2) that the damages ought to extend to the whole of the plaintiff's loss; and (3) that, on the facts, the sum of GBP 5,500 would be awarded.

SUMMARY Damages for deceit should compensate the plaintiff for all losses suffered, including loss of profits that could reasonably have been anticipated. D ran two hairdressing salons in neighbouring areas. P purchased one of the salons. During negotiations, D had falsely represented that he personally would not be working at his other salon. P failed to make a profit, and discovered that D was working full time at his salon. P was unable to sell the salon for three years. At trial P was awarded damages of GBP 33,328, including GBP 15,000 for loss of profits during the period in which P owned the business. D appealed against the award for loss of profits.
HELD allowing the appeal in part, that (1) damages for deceit were assessed on the basis that P should be compensated for all losses suffered, and that where the losses were made in the course of running a business, the assessment of damages would include both actual losses incurrred and loss of profits that could reasonably have been anticipated; (2) P had failed to earn expected profits from the business and was entitled to the loss of expected profits, but the judge had erred in assessing damages on the basis that D's statement amounted to a warranty that the business would have remained at the same level, and appropriate damages for loss of expected profits were GBP 10,000 (Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd [1969] 2 Q.B. 158 applied).

SUMMARY Negligent misrepresentation; pre-contractual statement; absolute obligation
SUMMARY The liability of the representor under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 (c.7) s.2(1) does not depend upon his being under a duty of care. In negotiations leading to a contract, the statute imposes an absolute obligation not to state facts which the representor cannot prove he had reasonable grounds to believe. A Ltd, civil engineering contractors, entered negotiations with H Ltd for the hire of two sea-going barges, owned by H Ltd, for carrying vast quantities of clay out to sea. At a meeting on July 11, 1974, the owners' marine manager orally represented to A Ltd that the capacity of the barges was 1,600 tonnes deadweight. He based that figure on his recollection of an entry in Lloyd's Register which gave the capacities as 1,800 tonnes. The Register was erroneous, and the correct deadweight capacity was 1,055 tonnes, which could have been ascertained from the ship's document in possession of H Ltd A Ltd continued negotiations without obtaining any other figure for the vital matter of deadweight capacity, and took the barges into use under a charterparty. The charterparty included an exception clause that the charterers' acceptance at handing over the barges should be conclusive that they had examined them and found them fit for their purpose. After about six months' use, A Ltd discovered the correct capacity and paid GBP 20,000 for the hire, refusing to pay any more. H Ltd withdrew the barges and issued proceedings claiming outstanding hire charges. A Ltd denied liability, and counterclaimed for damages alleging, inter alia, (1) breaches of collateral warranties in the representations before contract; (2) negligence arising from a special relationship between the parties and (3) liability under s.2(1) of the Act. Bristow, J. gave judgment for H Ltd On appeal by A Ltd, and cross-notice by H Ltd, held, allowing the appeal in part, that (1) there was nothing in the pre-contract negotiations which could amount to a collateral warranty; (2) per Bridge and Shaw L.JJ., the misrepresentation at the meeting of July 11, 1974, as to the deadweight capacity, was a most material matter and H Ltd had not proven that their marine manager had reasonable grounds for believing, and did believe, that the facts represented were true; (3) per Shaw and Bridge, L.J.J., H Ltd could not escape liability by reliance on the exception clause, since it was a provision which came within s.3 of the Act and was therefore of no effect unless the court allowed reliance upon it as being "fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the case" and since it was not "fair and reasonable" to allow reliance upon it, the cross-appeal should be dismissed. Per Shaw L.J., A Ltd also had a cause of action in negligence at common law.

SUMMARY Innocent misrepresentation; appropriate measure of damages; whether equivalent to those for fraudulent misrepresentation; whether sale novus actus interveniens
SUMMARY The measure for damages for innocent misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s.2(1) is the measure for fraudulent misrepresentation. D, a car dealer, agreed to sell a car on hire-purchase to a customer, C, for GBP 7,600, of which GBP 1,200 was paid as a deposit. D, in its proposal to the finance company P, mis-stated these figures as GBP 8,000 and GBP 1,600 respectively. On the basis of these figures P (who required a minimum deposit of 20 per cent of the purchase price) purchased the car from the dealer for GBP 6,400 and entered into a hire-purchase agreement with C. In August 1987, C dishonestly sold the car and paid no further instalments. GBP 3,625.24 remained to be paid by C to P. Judgment in default was entered for P for GBP 1,600 on the basis of the sale of a car at GBP 6,000. D appealed and P cross-appealed.
HELD dismissing the appeal and allowing the cross-appeal, that (1) the measure of damages recoverable for innocent misrepresentation under s.2(1) of the 1967 Act was the measure for fraudulent misrepresentation rather than for negligence; (2) P was entitled to recover damages for all losses suffered by it, flowing from the dealer's misrepresentation, provided that they were not too remote; (3) since it was reasonably foreseeable by D that C might wrongfully sell the car and P thereby would suffer loss, the sale by C was not a novus actus interveniens; accordingly the judge's order was varied ( Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd [1969] 2 Q.B. 158 applied).

SUMMARY Conveyancing; duty of care; misrepresentation by vendor; whether vendor's solicitor owed duty of care to purchaser
SUMMARY A vendor's solicitor does not owe a duty of care to a purchaser in ordinary conveyancing transactions. A plea of contributory negligence is available in answer to a claim for misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s.2. R granted an underlease to G at a premium of GBP 30,000. The headlease granted to R contained a clause giving the head lessor the right to terminate the headleases for redevelopment. In negotiations for the underlease, G's solicitors enquired whether there were any rights affecting the superior, leasehold title which would inhibit G's enjoyment of the property. R's solicitors answered "not to the lessor's knowledge". Subsequently the head lessor exercised the break- clause option and G sought damages against R and against R's solicitors alleging negligent misrepresentation.
HELD dismissing the claim against the solicitors and giving judgment for G against R, that in normal conveyancing transactions a purchaser had a remedy against the seller for any misrepresentations and so a seller's solicitor owed the buyer no duty of care. If a solicitor stepped outside the role of solicitor for his client and accepted a direct responsibility to the buyer then a duty of care might arise, but that had not happened here. The answer given to the enquiry was a misrepresentation by R upon which G had relied and G was entitled to damages. A defence that G had been contributorily negligent (by failing to call for the head lease) was open to R but, on the facts, did not succeed.

SUMMARY Rescission; election; communication
SUMMARY Where a fraudulent rogue absconds, a seller of goods sufficiently exercises his election to rescind if he at once, on discovering the fraud, takes all possible steps to regain the goods, even though he cannot find the rogue nor communicate with him. C sold a motor-car to N and accepted a cheque in part payment. The cheque was dishonoured the following morning, whereupon C asked both the police and the Automobile Association to trace the motor-car. N sold the car to M company, a firm of motor dealers, who had notice from which they could have inferred that N had acquired the car fraudulently. Immediately after acquiring the car, M filled up hire-purchase forms, selling the car to G and C, a finance company, in which M expressly warranted that the car belonged absolutely to themselves. Seventeen days after the transaction between C and N, C demanded the return of the car from M company, who claimed to have a good title to it. Eventually, C and U, another finance company, bought the car in good faith without notice of any defect in title. On the trial of the issue whether the car belonged to C and U or to C, held that (1) the title to the car was vested in C as he had rescinded the contract of sale when he asked the police to recover the car; but (2) M, the dealers, were not the agents of G and C, the first finance company, so as to fix G and C with notice of the defective title.

SUMMARY Contract for sale; rescission; mutual mistake; misrepresentation; contract for purchase of land pursuant to the National Conditions of Sale; undisclosed foul sewer discovered after completion; whether purchaser entitled to rescind; whether damages to be awarded; appropriate measure of damages
SUMMARY In a contract for the sale of land incorporating the National Conditions of Sale, there is no action in mistake or misrepresentation when an encumbrance that was not within the knowledge of the vendor at the time of the contract is subsequently discovered to have existed at the time of the contract. A contract was concluded for the sale and purchase of development land. The contract incorporated the National Conditions of Sale (20th ed.). The property was sold subject to, inter alia, any easements, liabilities and public rights affecting it. This was subject to V's duty to disclose all latent liabilities and easements known to it. P was deemed to have full notice of all easements, rights and privileges affecting it, with no obligation on V to define them. V replied to enquiries before contract stating that so far as it was aware there were no rights of easement or public rights affecting the property other than as disclosed in the contract. After completion a private foul sewer was discovered running under the property. P purported to rescind on the grounds of misrepresentation and common fundamental mistake. P applied for a declaration that the contract had been rescinded and for repayment of the purchase price, the value of the site having halved in value since completion. The declaration was granted and V appealed.
HELD allowing the appeal, that (1) V was required to disclose easements and encumbrances of which it had knowledge or means of knowledge. The National Conditions of Sale left no room for rescission on the grounds of mistake and cast the risk on to P as to the existence of encumbrances; (2) there was no evidence of misrepresentation by V, either negligent or otherwise; (3) the presence of the sewer did not seriously interfere with the use of the land so it would be inequitable for the contract to be rescinded. Damages would have been awarded in lieu of rescission under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s.2(2), had there been misrepresentation (Associated Japanese Bank (International) Ltd v Credit du Nord SA [1989] 1 W.L.R. 255 applied; Grist v Bailey [1967] Ch. 532, Laurence v Lexcourt Holdings [1978] 1 W.L.R. 1128 doubted). [Per curiam: The appropriate measure of damages awarded in lieu of rescission under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, s.2(2), is different from that under s.2(1), being the difference in value between what P was misled into thinking he was buying and the value of what he in fact received, and damages should therefore never exceed the sum which would have been payable had the representation been a warranty.]

CATEGORY Insolvency Other Related Subjects: Trusts; Insurance; Administration; Administrators' Powers and Duties; Apportionment; Client Accounts; Distribution; Equitable Jurisdiction; Insurance Intermediaries; Insurance Premiums; Remuneration; Statutory Trusts
ABSTRACT The administrators of two insolvent insurance intermediaries applied, under the Insolvency Act 1986 Sch.B1 para.63 or alternatively pursuant to the court's inherent equitable jurisdiction, for directions for the distribution of moneys held in client accounts.
ABSTRACT Before they went into administration, the companies operated in common ownership. Although insolvent, they had significant funds in client accounts representing insurance premiums that had been received from customers and not yet paid on to insurers. Those accounts were subject to the statutory trust regime in Chapter 5 of the Client Assets Sourcebook (CASS 5) in the Financial Conduct Authority Handbook. CASS 5.6.7R provided that, in the event of insolvency, client money had to be treated as pooled and then distributed so that each client received a sum calculated in accordance with a specific method set out in CASS 5.5.67R. The administrators took the view that, since neither company had kept proper records of the entitlement to client account funds, it would be impracticable to attempt to ascertain that entitlement with certainty. Accordingly, they proposed a scheme of distribution and identified a schedule of issues in respect of which they sought particular guidance.
ABSTRACT The issues concerned (1) the question whether the funds in the client accounts were subject to the statutory trusts or belonged to the companies; (2) the ascertainment of entitlement to moneys subject to the statutory trusts and their apportionment among various claimants; (3) a possible claim on behalf of the first company against the statutory trust pool of the second; (4) the administrators' entitlement to remuneration out of the funds in the statutory trusts.
SUMMARY On an application under the Insolvency Act 1986 Sch.B1 para.63 by the administrators of two insolvent insurance intermediaries, the court gave directions for the distribution of funds held in the companies' client accounts which were subject to the statutory trust regime in Chapter 5 of the Client Assets Sourcebook in the Financial Conduct Authority Handbook.
HELD Directions given.
HELD (1) The trusts' purpose was to protect the customers of the business and their continuing administration was within the scope of the companies' affairs for the purposes of Sch.B1 para.59 of the Act. Thus, the court had power under Sch.B1 para.63 to give directions to the administrators in respect of those funds even though they did not form part of the company's assets, Denny v Yeldon [1995] 3 All E.R. 624 applied. Although para.63 did not specify the scope of the directions that might properly be given, the court was entitled to exercise its inherent equitable jurisdiction when seised of an application under that provision, MF Global UK Ltd (In Special Administration), Re [2013] EWHC 1655 (Ch), [2013] 1 W.L.R. 3874 applied (see paras 49-55 of judgment).
HELD (2) Client money was received and held on the statutory trusts unless the firm was acting in accordance with CASS 5.4, the conditions for which were not fulfilled in the instant case. Moreover, there was nothing to suggest that deductions for commission, interest or any other matters should be made (paras 60, 64, 67). All clients with a client money entitlement were to be regarded as entitled to participate in the relevant pool, not merely those whose contributions were identifiable. Claims against the pool were not affected where the cover had been provided gratuitously, and any claims by intermediaries for fees or commission would be considered (paras 71, 73, 78).
HELD (3) There was no reason why one statutory trust should not in principle be able to trace into the assets of another statutory trust where there had been a breach of trust. Although CASS statutory trusts had to be understood in terms of their own regulatory scheme and were not confined by the general law of trusts, that did not mean that victims of wrongs against the trust were deprived of an equitable remedy. Where the breach of trust had applied prior to pooling, the effect of successful tracing in support of a claim would be to augment the pool to the benefit of those who were beneficiaries of a statutory trust before pooling occurred (paras 118-119).
HELD (4) If it became clear that poor record-keeping created a need for significant work to be done by the administrators to identify claimants, an application ought to be made to the court for directions and for prior sanction of remuneration. The words "costs properly attributable to the distribution of the client money" in CASS 5.3.2R meant the costs incurred for the purpose of enabling such distribution to be made and the costs of making such a distribution. Any work that might properly be done to enable the administrators to distribute the trust moneys was capable of being remunerated under that rule; therefore, there was no reason to have recourse to a general equitable jurisdiction. However, if it had been held that the rule related only to the costs of making the distribution, the jurisdiction under Berkeley Applegate (Investment Consultants) Ltd (No.1), Re [1989] Ch. 32 would have been available in respect of costs relating to preliminary work not covered by the rule. According to that jurisdiction, where the court was considering the enforcement of a claim to an equitable interest in property, it had a discretion to require that an allowance be made for costs incurred and for skill and labour expended in connection with the administration of that property, Berkeley Applegate considered (paras 139, 144-147).

FLAGS Criticised
ABSTRACT In three conjoined appeals in which one or other party had sought relief from sanctions arising pursuant to CPR r.3.9, the court was required to determine the correct approach to the rule and to the guidance given in Mitchell v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2013] EWCA Civ 1537, [2014] 1 W.L.R. 795.
ABSTRACT The respective judges had purported to apply the Mitchell guidance, but in each case, the parties had been treated inconsistently. M itchell had received criticism for having a "triviality" test which effectively amounted to an "exceptionality" test, where the latter had been rejected by Sir Rupert Jackson's "Review of Civil Litigation costs: Final Report" in December 2009. It had also been criticised for describing factors (a) and (b) in r.3.9(1) as "paramount considerations" and downplaying the requirement for the court to consider all the circumstances of the case. It had been further criticised for causing disproportionate penalties to be imposed for breaches which had little practical effect on litigation. The instant court was required to examine those criticisms.
SUMMARY The court clarified and further explained the guidance given in Mitchell v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2013] EWCA Civ 1537, [2014] 1 W.L.R. 795 regarding the proper approach to be taken by the courts to the issue of relief from sanctions pursuant to CPR r.3.9. The court also emphasised the duty on parties to assist the court in furthering the overriding objective, outlining the expected standards of compliance and co-operation between litigants and warning that opportunism and unreasonably contested applications for relief from sanctions would be penalised.
HELD Appeals allowed.
HELD (Jackson LJ concurring in the result but dissenting in part in the reasoning) (1) The text of r.3.9(1) contained three elements: identification of the "failure to comply"; consideration of "all the circumstances of the case"; and consideration of factors (a) and (b). The guidance given in paras 40 and 41 of Mitchell as to how that approach was to be applied in practice remained substantially sound, but it needed to be clarified and further explained. Some first instance judges had ignored the fact that it was necessary to consider all the circumstances of a case; others had adopted a more traditional approach of giving pre-eminence to the need to decide claims on their merits when there was no room for such an approach in the post-Jackson era. Useful amplification of the Mitchell guidance had already been given in some of the authorities immediately following the Mitchell decision, but some judges were being unduly draconian in their approaches, and others unduly relaxed. The view that an application for relief was bound to fail unless a default could be characterised as trivial, or unless there was a good reason for it, was leading to manifestly unjust decisions and was an approach which was not mandated by what the court said in Mitchell . The following clarification was intended to create a reasonably consistent judicial approach to the application of r.3.9, making it unnecessary to refer to earlier authorities in future, and assisting in reducing the need for satellite litigation. In future, judges were to adopt a three-stage approach: (a) they had to identify and assess the seriousness or significance of the relevant failure. Triviality was not part of that stage. There were clearly degrees of seriousness and significance. The assessment ought not to involve consideration of past unrelated failures, only the seriousness and significance of the very breach in respect of which relief from sanctions was sought. If a breach was not serious or significant, relief would usually be granted and there would be no need to spend much time on the second and third stages; (b) the second stage did not derive from r.3.9 but was nevertheless important: the court had to consider why the failure or default occurred. It would be inappropriate to produce an encyclopedia of good and bad reasons; paragraph 41 of Mitchell gave some examples but they were nothing more than that; (c) the third stage required the court to consider all the circumstances of the case. A serious breach for no reason was not automatically prevented from attracting relief. Factors (a) and (b) in r.3.9 remained of particular importance and were to be given particular weight at the third stage. Therefore, if the effect of a breach was to prevent the efficient and proportionate conduct of litigation, that would weigh against relief being granted. Likewise, the old lax culture of non-compliance with rules, practice directions and orders was no longer tolerated, and compliance had to be considered in every case. However, other relevant factors would also be relevant and would vary on a case-by-case basis (see paras 22-38, 81-82 of judgment). (2) Litigation could not be conducted efficiently and proportionately without fostering a culture of compliance and co-operation. CPR r.1.3 required parties to help the court to further the overriding objective and those who opportunistically and unreasonably opposed applications for relief from sanctions breached that obligation. Where the failure was neither serious nor significant, where a good reason was demonstrated, and where it was otherwise obvious that relief from sanctions should be granted, parties ought to agree that relief should be granted. In any event, extensions of time of up to 28 days ought readily to be given, as envisaged by r.3.8(4). Contested applications for relief ought to arise only in exceptional cases (paras 39-44). (3) The judges in each of the three appeals had erred in their case management powers and their orders were set aside.

CATEGORY Personal Injury Other Related Subjects: Legal Advice and Funding; Torts; Civil Procedure; Insurance; Conditional Fee Agreements; Fees; Insurance Companies; Liens; Personal Injury Claims; Pre-Action Protocols; Settlement; Solicitors' Remuneration
ABSTRACT A firm of solicitors (G) appealed against the dismissal ([2014] EWHC 3062 (QB), [2015] R.T.R. 14) of its claim against the respondent insurer.
ABSTRACT G had entered into conditional fee agreements (CFAs) to represent six clients in personal injury claims against the insurer. The insurer had settled the claims directly with the clients on an inclusive basis, meaning that G had been deprived of their costs. G had therefore brought the instant claim in order to recover their fees, disbursements and success fees from the insurer. They sought equitable intervention by the court, claiming that the insurer had wrongfully prevented them from establishing a lien on the settlement sums for their costs. The CFAs incorporated a Law Society document which provided that a client who won the claim would pay G's charges, disbursements and a success fee, which it could claim from its opponent. However, each client also received a client care letter which indicated that if the client won, G would be able to recover their fees, disbursements and success fee from the opponent and had the right to take recovery action in the client's name. Each CFA was subject to the Cancellation of Contracts made in a Consumer's Home or Place of Work etc. Regulations 2008, meaning that each client had the right to cancel his retainer within a seven-day period. In the case of two of the clients, the insurer made the offer to compromise within that seven-day period.
ABSTRACT The issues were whether:
ABSTRACT (i) the principle of equitable intervention set out in Khans Solicitors v Chifuntwe [2013] EWCA Civ 481, [2014] 1 W.L.R. 1185 could operate only where a defendant had express notice of a lien;
ABSTRACT (ii) a lien could arise in circumstances where the clients were under no personal liability to pay G's fees;
ABSTRACT (iii) the insurer's liability was affected by the fact that an offer might have been made at a time when a retainer could still be cancelled.
SUMMARY An insurer which made settlement offers directly to a number of personal injury claimants had done so in order to avoid paying the costs of a firm of solicitors which had entered into conditional fee agreements with the claimants. Although the claimants had no personal liability to pay the solicitors' fees under the terms of the conditional fee agreement the solicitors had an interest which the insurer had notice of and the principle of equitable intervention operated to require the insurer to pay the solicitors' fees.
HELD Appeal allowed.
HELD (1) There was no reason in principle why implied, rather than express, notice of a lien should not be sufficient for the operation of the principle of equitable intervention. In any event, express notice had been given in the instant case. It was apparent from transcripts of telephone calls that the insurer had intended to avoid paying G's costs by entering into a settlement directly with the clients. The insurer's knowledge of and participation in the scheme established by the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents meant that it was well aware of G's interest in receiving its fixed costs and other sums due under the scheme, Khans applied (see paras 25-26, 28-29 of judgment).
HELD (2) There was a tension between the provisions in the CFAs. The provision in the client care letter had to prevail because it was expressed to be for the avoidance of doubt. That meant that G had no recourse against their clients for the fees and were limited to what they could recover from the losing side. In those circumstances, they would not have a lien over assets received in their clients' account because the clients had no underlying liability to them. However, under the normal course of events, G would have an entitlement to recover the fixed costs and other sums payable under the Protocol scheme. That was either an entitlement of the solicitors themselves or, alternatively, an entitlement to bring proceedings in the name of the clients to recover those sums. In either case, G had an interest which equity could protect and which was deserving of protection. The insurer was aware of that interest because of its knowledge of and participation in the Protocol scheme. That might involve an extension of the principle in Khans , but there was no reason why that principle should not apply in the circumstances of the case. The Protocol scheme was not mandatory and it was therefore open to the insurer to enter into compromise agreements with the claimants outside the Protocol. However, that was not what had happened. In each case, the client had authorised G to commence the Protocol process on his behalf and the insurer had voluntarily entered into the Protocol process. Neither the clients nor the insurer had formally exited the process before entering into the compromise agreements. The insurer had acted with the intention of defeating G's entitlement under the scheme, Khans applied (paras 18, 30-32).
HELD (3) The fact that an offer might have been made at a time when a retainer could still be cancelled could not relieve the insurer of liability. It would have been open to the insurer to make the offer conditional upon cancellation of G' retainer within the permitted period, but it did not do so. In each case, the insurer assumed the risk that its offer might be accepted after the expiry of the cancellation period. In any event, in none of the underlying cases was the retainer cancelled or otherwise terminated (paras 21, 34-37).
HELD (4) The insurer entered into each compromise agreement with notice of G's entitlement and the principle of equitable intervention required it to pay to G the sums payable on settlement under the Protocol scheme (para.38).

SUMMARY Mistake
SUMMARY Where A makes an offer to B, in the belief (known to B) that B is X, there is no offer capable of acceptance by B. B said he would buy A's motor-car for GBP 717, and produced a cheque book. A was not prepared to accept a cheque and refused to sell. B then stated that he was X and gave an address. A checked the telephone directory and discovered that there was a person named X living at the address given. A then agreed to let B have the car against a cheque for GBP 717, which was later dishonoured. B had meanwhile sold the car to the defendant, who purchased in good faith. In an action for damages for conversion Slade J. gave judgment for A, and the defendant appealed.
HELD dismissing the appeal, as A intended to deal only with the genuine X, B was incapable of accepting A's offer to sell the car, so that the property therein remained in A.

SUMMARY Mistake; identity of purchaser
SUMMARY Where A and B are present together, and A sells goods to B, there is a very strong presumption that A intended to contract with B, and not with C, whose identity B had falsely assumed. R called on L, who had a car for sale. R called himself "G," who was a well-known television actor, and produced a film studio pass in G's name bearing R's photograph. L accepted R's cheque and allowed R to take the car and logbook away. The cheque was worthless. Later R, pretending to be L, sold the car to A, who had no reason to suspect anything was wrong. When L discovered A had the car, he sued him for its return. On appeal, held, that L had been intending to, and did, contract with R, the person physically present, so that the title to the car had passed to L and thence, the contract not having been avoided in the meantime, to A.

SUMMARY A hire purchase agreement by which a fraudster obtained a car from a finance company by falsely pretending to be someone else was a nullity and a purchaser of the car from the fraudster could not obtain good title under the Hire Purchase Act 1964 s.27.
SUMMARY H, the purchaser of a motor car, appealed against a decision ([2001] EWCA Civ 1000, [2002] Q.B. 834, [2001] C.L.Y. 917) that he had not obtained a good title to a car under the Hire Purchase Act 1964 s.27 on the ground that R, the person he bought it from, was a fraudster who obtained it from S, a finance company, under a void agreement. R had entered into a hire purchase agreement with S at a car dealer's premises and obtained the car by falsely pretending to be another person, P. R then sold the car to H. H acted in good faith and would have obtained a good title by virtue of s.27 if R's possession was under the hire purchase agreement. The judge at first instance ([2000] C.L.Y. 2600) held that the agreement with R was a nullity and gave judgment for S. The Court of Appeal by a majority upheld that decision on the basis that the agreement, if made with anyone, was made with P and that R was not the hirer named in the agreement. In the instant appeal, H argued that in the circumstances S had contracted face to face with R.
HELD dismissing the appeal (Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Millett dissenting), that (1) the agreement had been concluded in writing and the identification of the parties to that agreement depended on its construction and on that basis, P was the hirer under the agreement with S; (2) in a consumer credit transaction, the identity of the customer was fundamental to the whole transaction because it was essential to the credit checking of the borrower, and as the agreement with P was concluded without his authority, it was a nullity; (3) there was no meeting of minds between S and R as R never had any face to face dealings with S. The car dealer was the agent of S in delivering the car to R but was acting without authority since its authority was to deliver to P. Further, there was no contract with R and no bailment of the car by S to R; (4) the purported signature on the hire purchase agreement was not P's and that agreement therefore lacked an essential ingredient and was never an offer eligible for acceptance, and (5) according to Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead and Lord Millett, in a case of mistaken identity, a person should be presumed to contract with the person with whom he was actually dealing.

ABSTRACT The court was required to determine preliminary issues in a claim for negligence and breach of statutory duty against the defendant Registrar of Companies.
ABSTRACT The claimant was the former managing director of a company called Taylor and Sons Limited. The company was a steel fabricator. It was a well-respected and substantial business. In 2009 a winding-up order was made against an unrelated company, Taylor and Son Limited, and sent to the registrar. The order did not contain a company number. The registrar inadvertently amended the registration details of the claimant's company, as its name was very similar, showing it to be in liquidation. The company's accountant noticed the mistake and contacted the registrar, who rectified public online records later the same day but was unable to correct subscription services for several weeks. The company's suppliers and creditors, including the company's bank, became aware of the false entry on the register and suspended the company's credit. The company subsequently went into administration. The court was required to determine whether (i) the registrar owed the company a duty of care under the Companies Act 2006 to exercise reasonable care and skill so as to ensure that incorrect information was not entered on to the register; (ii) the registrar owed the company a duty of care under common law; (iii) the registrar's breach of duty had caused the company to enter administration.
SUMMARY The Registrar of Companies had a common law duty of care, when entering a winding-up order on the companies register, to take reasonable care to ensure that the order was not registered against the wrong company.
HELD Preliminary issues determined in favour of claimant.
HELD (1) The court was not satisfied that there was a cause of action for damages for breach of statutory duty against the registrar in relation to his functions under the 2006 Act. The Act regulated the keeping of the register and imposed duties on the registrar for that purpose. The register published information which was available to the whole world, because it was available on the internet. The common law of negligence had control mechanisms designed to restrict the class of person who could claim damages for economic loss. However, the imposition of a statutory duty giving rise to a claim for damages at the suit of anyone who suffered economic loss by reason of any act or omission in breach of the statutory duty would create a very wide duty indeed. There was nothing in the Act to justify a finding that that was the intention of Parliament (see para.106 of judgment). (2) If a person did an act which was capable of causing harm to a particular person if done carelessly, he would have assumed responsibility to that person in respect of that task, White v Jones [1995] 2 A.C. 207 followed. In determining whether an assumption of responsibility and duty of care existed, the court took the following factors into account: (a) unless a remedy was provided by the common law of negligence, a company damaged by carelessness in these circumstances would have no remedy; (b) it was not difficult for the registrar's staff to avoid errors of the instant type; (c) there were no public policy reasons for denying a duty of care; (d) the statutory duty or contractual relationship between the company and the registrar did not limit the nature and extent of the responsibility; (e) balancing the harm done to the company against the potential adverse impact on the registrar, it was clear that the balance favoured the loss falling on the registrar rather than the company; (f) it was likely that the imposition of a duty would improve the accuracy of the register, which was plainly in the public interest. It was fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care upon the registrar. A special relationship between the registrar and the company arose because it was foreseeable that if a company was wrongly said to be in liquidation, it would suffer serious harm. The nature of the exercise also supported the existence of such a relationship. The company was not consulted before an entry was made and had no opportunity to protest that the entry, if made, would be a mistake. Foreseeability and proximity had been established, Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman [1990] 2 A.C. 605, Ministry of Housing and Local Government v Sharp [1970] 2 Q.B. 223 and Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank Plc [2006] UKHL 28, [2007] 1 A.C. 181 followed. Accordingly, the registrar owed a duty of care when entering a winding-up order on the register to take reasonable care to ensure that the order was not registered against the wrong company. The duty was owed to any company which was not in liquidation but which was wrongly recorded on the register as having been wound up by order of the court. The duty extended to take reasonable care to enter the order on the record of the company named in the order, and not any other company. It did not extend to checking information supplied by third parties, but only to entering that information accurately on the register (paras 108-118). (3) The registrar's error had been a disaster for the company. The rumour of insolvency spread and the suppliers' immediate reaction was to refuse further credit to the company. Prior to the error, the suppliers had been trading on ordinary 30-day credit terms, and actually affording longer periods of credit than that. The company's main customer terminated the company's contract because of its concerns about the company's future, which were fuelled by rumours resulting from the error. The bank refused to lend further money to the company. The claimant had proved that the reason the company went into administration was the error made by the registrar (paras 37, 39, 47-48).

SUMMARY War-damaged house; loss of identity
SUMMARY As a matter of general principle, where a house within the Landlord and tenant Acts is so structurally altered that it becomes a new dwelling-house by reason of change of identity, the new premises shed all the attributes of the old. Whether any particular alterations come within this principle is a question of fact, but the inclusion of a garage in the demise has no material effect on the identity of the dwelling-house. Where there is a mutual mistake as to the effect of the structural alteration on the identity of the house, the Court, acting on the principle laid down in Cooper v Phibbs (1867) L.R. 2 H.L. 149 , will set aside a lease entered into under such a common misapprehension. The demised premises, a flat, had been let in 1939 at a standard rent of GBP 140 a year, and in repairing war-damage the landlord had made substantial alterations to the flat. Had the necessary notices been served, the increase in respect of improvements permitted under s.2(1) of the Act of 1920 would have brought the rent up to approximately GBP 250 a year, but the landlord and the tenant, who was a surveyor and a partner with the landlord in a firm of estate agents, were satisfied that the reconstructed flat was not subject to the previous standard rent of GBP 140 a year, and no notices were served. On completion of the work, the landlord let the flat, together with a garage which had not been previously demised, on a seven years' lease at GBP 250 a year. Subsequently, the tenant sought a declaration that the standard rent was GBP 140 a year and claimed repayment of the amount overpaid. Held, (1) disregarding the garage, which was not material to the question, the alterations were not such as to change the identity of the flat, and, since it was clear from the decision in Welch v Nagy [1950] 1 K.B. 455 , that no rule of estoppel could oust the jurisdiction of the court under the Acts, the tenant was not estopped by conduct, and the standard rent of GBP 140 a year applied; (2) (Jenkins, L.J., dissenting) there was a mutual mistake which was fundamental and in no way due to any fault of the landlord, so that in equity the landlord was entitled to have the lease set aside. ( Cooper v. Phibbs and Welch v. Nagy applied; Garrard v Frankel 54 E.R. 961 applied; Paget v Marshall (1884) 28 Ch.

SUMMARY Defendant chartered vessel to give assistance on basis of wrong information about its location - Defendant cancelled contract and declined to pay - Contract not void at common law for mutual mistake - Vessels not so far apart as to make contractual services which could have been provided substantially different from contractual services envisaged by parties - No equitable discretion to rescind for mistake contract which was valid at law.
SUMMARY T appealed against an order that it was liable to pay to G a sum representing the cancellation fee under a binding contract between the parties. T had been engaged to provide salvage services to a ship which had suffered serious structural damage at sea. T had contracted with G to hire G's merchant vessel for a minimum of five days to help with crew evacuation. Both parties had believed that the two ships were in close proximity to each other but it had subsequently emerged that they were not and T had cancelled the arrangement and refused to pay anything in respect of hire charges. Upon the issue of proceedings for a sum representing the hire charges for the minimum period or alternatively damages for wrongful repudiation of the contract, judgment had been given for G. In its appeal, T, relying upon the test of mistake identified in Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd [1932] A.C. 161 reasserted that the contract had been concluded by reason of a fundamental mistake of fact which had deprived the contract of the consideration underlying it. T maintained that the contract was either void in law or it was voidable so that T was entitled to relief in equity by way of rescission following Solle v Butcher [1950] 1 K.B. 671.
HELD dismissing the appeal, that precedents covering the effect of mistake on contract had historically been difficult to reconcile and the instant case provided the first opportunity to clarify the relationship between Bell and Solle . It was important to analyse the rights and obligations created by the contract before considering the effect of an alleged mistake. Bell indicated that equitable intervention such as that demonstrated in Cooper v Phibbs (1867) L.R. 2 H.L. 149 was permissible where the common law would have ruled the contract void for mistake and it was thought to be unlikely that the court in Bell had overlooked an equitable right to rescind an agreement in different circumstances. Whereas Bell was concerned with the question whether the mistake had the effect of producing a situation where the parties were only able to provide something essentially different from that which they had contracted to provide, Solle and the cases which followed it were more concerned with circumstances where the effect of the mistake made the contract a bad bargain for one of the parties. The two cases were irreconcilable and the only way to restore coherence to that area of the law was to declare that there was no jurisdiction to grant rescission of a contract on the ground of common mistake where the contract was valid and enforceable as far as the ordinary principles of contract law were concerned, Solle doubted and Bell applied. In the instant case, the contract between the parties was binding and upon cancellation of it, there was no injustice in the cancellation fee provided for in the contract becoming payable. Cooper considered.

SUMMARY Building contract; delay
SUMMARY Per Lord Reid: "It appears to me that frustration depends, at least in most cases, not on adding any implied term but on the true construction of the terms which are in the contract, read in the light of the nature of the contract and of the relevant surrounding circumstances when the contract was made. . . . On this view, there is no need to consider what the parties thought, or how they or reasonable men in their shoes would have dealt with the new situation if they had foreseen it. The question is whether the contract which they did make is, on its true construction, wide enough to apply to the new situation: if it is not, then it is at an end." Per Lord Radcliffe: ". . . frustration occurs whenever the law recognises that, without default of either party, a contractual obligation has become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract. Non haec in foedera veni. It was not this that I promised to do." In 1946 the plaintiffs agreed to build 78 houses for the defendants. The contract price was GBP 85,836. The work was to be completed within eight months. Before the contract was signed the plaintiffs had written to the defendants: "Our tender is subject to adequate supplies of material and labour being available as and when required to carry out the work within the time specified." Owing to bad weather, but more particularly to an unforeseen shortage of available labour, due to an unexpected lag in the demobilisation of troops after the war, the work took 22 months to complete. The contractors received the contract price, but they claimed that by reason of the delay they were entitled to treat the contract as void and to be paid on a quantum meruit. Lord Goddard C.J. held that on the wording of the contract the contractors were entitled to throw over the contract and sue on a quantum meruit basis. The Court of Appeal had remitted the case to the arbitrator for further findings. The appeal was heard after the arbitrator had made a supplemental award, when it was allowed on the grounds that (1) the condition in the letter meant that, if adequate supplies of material and labour should not be available when wanted, the contractors would be excused from completing the work within eight months but would be given a reasonable time; that the condition affected the time, but not the price; and that, so interpreted, the condition had been fully honoured; and that (2) when an owner employed a builder to do work for a fixed sum, his whole object was to secure himself against the unexpected difficulties which so often arose; and that the court could seriously damage the sanctity of contracts if it allowed a builder to charge more simply because, without anyone's fault, the work took him much longer than he thought.
HELD on appeal to the House of Lords, (1) the letter merely formed part of the negotiations which led up to the contract and its terms were not incorporated into that contract; (2) in a contract of this kind the contractor undertook to do the work for a definite sum, and he took the risk of the cost being greater or less than he expected; if delay occurred through no one's fault, that might be in the contemplation of the contract and there might be provision for extra time being given; to that extent the other party took the risk of delay; but he did not take the risk of the cost being increased by such delay; it might be that delay could be of a character so different from anything contemplated that the contract would be at an end, but in this case the most that could be said was that the delay was greater in degree than was to be expected; it was not caused by any new and unforeseeable factor or event; the job proved to be more onerous but it never became a job of a different kind from that contemplated in the contract; therefore the appeal must be dismissed.

SUMMARY Lease; termination by frustration
SUMMARY The doctrine of frustration of contracts is in principle applicable to leases, although the occasions on which it may be applied are rare. A warehouse was demised to the defendants for a 10-year period. The only access to the warehouse was by a street which the local authority closed, after five years of the term had elapsed, for a 20-month period. In an action for unpaid rent the defendants claimed that the lease had been frustrated. The judge held that a lease could not be frustrated. On appeal direct to the House of Lords, held, dismissing the appeal, (1) frustration could be applied to leases in rare cases; (2) on the facts here the doctrine did not apply.

SUMMARY Carriage by sea; charterparty; "time" charter for single voyage
SUMMARY Pearson J. was wrong in The Massalia in holding that a reference in a charterparty to sending a telegraph "on passing Suez Canal" imported an obligation to pass through the canal leading to frustration of the contract on the canal's closure. Charterers took a vessel on a time charterparty for a "trip out to India via Black Sea" including a war clause forbidding the charterers to bring her within a dangerous zone without the owners' consent. The vessel was trapped in the Suez Canal, which was a dangerous zone when she entered it. On her release the charterers claimed that the contract was frustrated and the owners treated this as a repudiation and claimed damages.
HELD that this was a time charterparty, the voyage being the measure of time, and the vessel was under the charterers' orders in entering the canal; they were therefore in breach of the war clause and the closure of the canal did not, on the facts, frustrate the venture because the situation was not fundamentally different.

SUMMARY Carriage by sea; charterparty; war; frustration; date
SUMMARY It is the acts of war themselves which might prevent further performance of a contract, and not the formal declaration of war. Thus, there is no automatic frustration of a contract by a declaration of war. X became trapped in the Shatt al-Arab when hostilities commenced between Iran and Iraq. A dispute arose as to when the contract became frustrated: C contended that it was the date of the formal declaration of war and O contended that it was the date on which it became generally accepted in shipping circles that passage out of the Shatt al-Arab was likely to be impossible for some considerable while to come. The arbitrator found in favour of O.
HELD dismissing C's appeal, that the date found by the arbitrator as the date on which the contract became frustrated, was within the area of permissible dates and the court would not interfere with his findings. A declaration of war did not of itself prevent and thus discharge performance of a contract, unless it made the contract illegal, as, for example, involving trading with the enemy. It was the acts of war themselves that operated to prevent further performance of the contract, and thus the arbitrator had been entitled to conclude that it was only when the actual physical war itself was such as to prevent further performance of the contract, that it became discharged.

SUMMARY Exclusion clause; fundamental breach
SUMMARY The so-called doctrine of fundamental breach does not operate so as to prevent reliance upon an exclusion of liability clause upon the contract being brought to an end. The defendants contracted with the plaintiffs to provide a night- patrol service at the latter's factory premises. The contract excluded liability on the defendants' part for "any injurious act or default of any employee of the (defendants) unless such act or default could have been foreseen and avoided by the exercise of due diligence on the part of the employer; nor in any event shall the company be held responsible for any loss suffered through fire or any other cause except in so far as is solely attributable to the negligence of the company's employees acting within the cause of their employment." One of the defendants' employees who had been satisfactorily employed by them for some three months deliberately started a small fire in the factory, the fire getting out of control and burning down the factory. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge's ruling that the defendants could rely upon the contract as excluding their liability.
HELD allowing the defendants' appeal, that whether an exclusion clause was apt to exclude or limit liability was a matter of construction of the contract; that the fact that a breach may be such as to justify the innocent party in terminating or treating as repudiated the contract did not mean that the terms of the contract in so far as they governed liability were not to be enforced; that, generally, parties to a contract, when they bargained on equal terms, should be at liberty to apportion liability in the contract as they saw fit; and that the wording of the exclusion clause in the instant case was adequate to exclude liability for what occurred.

There were numerous defects in the work, which caused the system not to heat adequately and to give off fumes, and which would cost GBP 174 to repair. M refused to pay. The county court judge held that there had been substantial performance of the contract, and gave judgment for B, subject to an appropriate set-off in favour of M. On appeal by M, held, allowing the appeal, that having regard to the nature of the defects and the cost of remedying them, B could not be said substantially to have performed the contract, and he was therefore not entitled to recover anything.

He is not obliged to accept the repudiation and sue for damages. Per Lord Reid: It might be different if it is proved that the contractor had no interest at all in enforcing the contract.A Scottish garage proprietor, by his agent, agreed with a Scottish advertising contractor for the display of advertisements in Scotland for his garage for three years. The fee was payable weekly and the contract provided that if any payment was four weeks in arrear the whole three years' payments should immediately become payable. On the same day the proprietor wrote to the contractor to cancel the contract. The contractor refused to do so, displayed the advertisements in accordance with it, and when the first payment was four weeks overdue, sued for the whole three years' payments.

ABSTRACT In conjoined appeals, the Supreme Court considered the law relating to contractual penalty clauses.
ABSTRACT Cavendish's appeal related to clauses in a share sale agreement which restricted competition by the seller of the shares and stipulated a reduced price in the event of default on his part. Beavis's appeal related to a parking charge of £85 imposed for overstaying the permitted period of free parking.
SUMMARY In determining whether a contractual provision was penal, the true test was whether it was a secondary obligation which imposed a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion to the innocent party's legitimate interest in the enforcement of the primary obligation.
HELD Appeals allowed in part.
HELD (Lord Toulson dissenting in part) (1) The purpose of the law relating to penalty clauses was to prevent a claimant recovering a sum of money in respect of a breach of contract committed by the defendant which bore little or no relationship to the loss actually suffered by the claimant as a result of the breach, Export Credits Guarantee Department v Universal Oil Products Co [1983] 1 W.L.R. 399 applied. The penalty rule regulated only the remedies available for breach of a party's primary obligations, not the primary obligations themselves. That concept provided the whole basis of the classic distinction in law between a penalty and a genuine pre-estimate of loss, the former being essentially a way of punishing the contract-breaker rather than compensating the innocent party (see paras 11-13 of judgment). Clydebank Engineering & Shipbuilding Co Ltd v Don Jose Ramos Yzquierdo y Castaneda [1905] A.C. 6 held that a contractual provision would be penal if it was "unconscionable and extravagant". In Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd [1915] A.C. 79, Lord Dunedin agreed that that was the essential question. Lord Atkinson considered that the question was the nature and extent of the innocent party's interest in the performance of the relevant obligation. In determining whether a contractual provision was penal, the true test was whether it was a secondary obligation which imposed a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the primary obligation. The innocent party could have no proper interest in simply punishing the defaulter. His interest was in performance or in some appropriate alternative to performance. Compensation was not necessarily the only legitimate interest that the innocent party might have in the performance of the defaulter's primary obligations, Clydebank , Dunlop , Lordsvale Finance Plc v Bank of Zambia [1996] Q.B. 752, United International Pictures v Cine Bes Filmcilik ve Yapimcilik AS [2003] EWCA Civ 1669, [2004] 1 C.L.C. 401, Murray v Leisureplay Plc [2005] EWCA Civ 963, [2005] I.R.L.R. 946 and White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1962] A.C. 413 applied (paras 19-32). Although the penalty rule was open to criticism, it would not be appropriate for the instant court to abolish it or extend it (paras 36-43). (2) In Cavendish's appeal, the first clause under consideration was, in reality, a price adjustment clause. It was a primary obligation, rather than a secondary provision. Although it had no relationship with the measure of loss attributable to the breach, Cavendish had a legitimate interest in the observance of the restrictive covenants which extended beyond the recovery of that loss. Viewed in the context of a carefully negotiated agreement between informed and legally advised parties at arm's length, the clause could not be regarded as extravagant, exorbitant or unconscionable. It was not a penalty (paras 74-78, 175-181). The second clause, which contained a price formula for the sale of retained shares, was justified by the same legitimate interest. It was not a penalty, Jobson v Johnson [1989] 1 W.L.R. 1026 doubted (paras 79-88, 182-187). (3) In Beavis's appeal, the parking charge had two main objectives: to manage the efficient use of parking space in the interests of the nearby retail outlets and of their customers, and to provide an income stream to enable ParkingEye to meet the costs of operating the scheme and make a profit. Those objectives were perfectly reasonable. The charge was not a penalty: ParkingEye had a legitimate interest in charging overstaying motorists which extended beyond the recovery of any loss. There was no reason to suppose that £85 was out of all proportion to ParkingEye's interests. Motorists regularly used the car park knowing of the charge, which was some evidence of its reasonableness. They clearly regarded the risk of having to pay £85 for overstaying as an acceptable price to pay for the convenience of parking there. The fact that some customers underestimated or overlooked the time required or taken for shopping, or whatever else they were doing, did not make the scheme excessive or unconscionable (paras 97-101, 198). The parking charge did not infringe the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. A reasonable motorist in Beavis's position would have agreed to the term imposing the charge in individual contract negotiations, Aziz v Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya, Tarragona i Manresa (Catalunyacaixa) (C-415/11) [2013] 3 C.M.L.R. 5 applied (paras 102-114, 200-213). (4) (Per Lord Mance) The courts below had found some support in the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 for the view that charges like the parking charge in Beavis's case were not to be regarded as unenforceable. That was a misreading of the Act. The reference in Sch.4 para.1 to a relevant "obligation" did not exclude the penalty doctrine. On the contrary, if a contractually-stipulated charge was a penalty, there would be no obligation (para.191). (Per Lord Toulson) The penalty clause made no allowance for circumstances, allowed no period of grace and provided no room for adjustment. ParkingEye had failed to show factual grounds on which it could reasonably assume that a customer using the car park would have agreed, in individual negotiations, to pay £85 if he overstayed for even one minute, Aziz considered (paras 306-314).

SUMMARY Remoteness; loss of profit arising from delay in delivery
SUMMARY In considering the authorities on remoteness of damage the following general propositions emerge: (1) It is well settled that the governing purpose of damages is to put the party whose rights have been violated in the same position, so far as money can do so, as if his rights had been observed. This purpose, if relentlessly pursued, would provide him with a complete indemnity for all losses de facto resulting from a particular breach, however improbable, however unpredictable. This, in contract at least, is recognised as too harsh a rule; (2) in cases of breach of contract the aggrieved party is only entitled to recover such part of the loss actually resulting as was at the time of the contract reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach; (3) what was at that time reasonably foreseeable depends on the knowledge then possessed by the parties, or, at all events, by the party who later commits the breach; (4) for this purpose, knowledge "possessed" is of two kinds - one imputed, the other actual. Everyone, as a reasonable person, is taken to know the "ordinary course of things" and, consequently, what loss is liable to result from a breach of that ordinary course. This is the subject-matter of the "first rule" in, Hadley v Baxendale 156 E.R. 145 , but to this knowledge, which a contract-breaker is assumed to possess, whether he actually possesses it or not, there may have to be added in a particular case knowledge which he actually possesses of special circumstances outside the "ordinary course of things" of such a kind that a breach in those special circumstances would be liable to cause more loss. Such a case attracts the operation of the "second rule" so as to make additional loss also recoverable; (5) in order to make the contract-breaker liable under either rule, it is not necessary that he should actually have asked himself what loss is liable to result from a breach. It suffices that, if he had considered the question, he would, as a reasonable man, have concluded that the loss in question was liable to result, and (6) nor, finally, to make a particular loss recoverable, need it be proved that on a given state of knowledge the defendant could, as a reasonable man, foresee that a breach must necessarily result in that loss. It is enough if he could foresee it was likely to result. It is enough - to borrow from the language of Lord du Parcq in Monarch Steamship Co v A/B Karlshamns Oljefabriker [1947-51] C.L.Y. 2562 if the loss (or some factor without which it would not have occurred) is a "serious possibility" or a "real danger". (Perhaps the colloquialism "on the cards" indicates the shade of meaning with greater accuracy than "likely" to result.) Applying these general principles to a case where the plaintiffs, a laundry company, claimed damages from the defendants, an engineering company, for delay in supplying a boiler, which - so the defendants had been informed - was to "be put into use in the shortest possible space of time", it was held that the obvious purpose for which a boiler in a business such as the plaintiff company's was to be used leapt to the eye, and that no supplier, let alone an engineering company which had promised delivery of such an article by a particular date, with knowledge that it was to be put into use immediately on delivery, could reasonably contend that it could not foresee that loss of profit or loss of business would be liable to result to the purchaser from a long delay in delivery thereof, with the consequence that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages for loss of profits resulting from the enforced delay in extending their business, Monarch Steamship Co v A/B Karlshamns Oljefabriker[1947-51] C.L.Y. 2562 ; Hadley v Baxendale 156 E.R. 145 , British Columbia Saw Mill Co Ltd v Nettleship (1867-68) L.R. 3 C.P. 499 distinguished; and Portman v Middleton 140 E.R. 1108 distinguished.

SUMMARY Carriage by sea; charterparty; delay; measure of damages
SUMMARY Where a party is in breach of a contract for the carriage of commodities, the price of which commodities is liable to fluctuate, he ought to have foreseen such fluctuation; accordingly if the price falls this is reflected in the measure of damages. The appellant shipowner entered into a charterparty with the respondents, who were merchants. Under the terms of the charterparty the ship was to be loaded with sugar at Constanza on or after October 27, 1960, and was to proceed therefrom with all convenient speed to Basrah. In fact the ship called at several ports en route to Basrah thus taking some nine days longer to arrive than it would have done had it sailed directly to Basrah. The price of sugar at Basrah fell during those nine days, and in the result the respondents' sugar was sold for GBP 4,183 16s. 8d. less than it would have been had it arrived promptly. Disputes having arisen an umpire found as facts, inter alia, (a) that sugar was regularly bought and sold at Basrah, which fact was known to the appellant; (b) that the price of sugar there fluctuated from time to time; (c) that shipowners generally knew that there was some urgency in carrying sugar, a perishable commodity, to its destination; and (d) that the appellant did not know that the respondents intended to sell the sugar promptly on arrival. The appellant admitted that the delay was in breach of the charterparty. As to the measure of damages, held (1) that on the facts the appellant ought to have foreseen that delay would involve a serious possibility of a real danger that the price of sugar would decline; and (2) that the proper damages were therefore GBP 4,183 16s. 8d., the difference between the price which the sugar ought to have fetched if it had arrived on time and the price which it in fact fetched. (The "serious possibility of real danger," per Lords Upjohn and Pearce, was expressed in differing terms by Lords Reid, Morris of Borth-y-Gest, and Hodson.)

SUMMARY Remoteness; foreseeability; pig food unfit for consumption
SUMMARY Where parties contemplate the type of consequence which may follow a breach of contract, they will be liable for specific damage of that type, even where the specific damage was not foreseeable. The defendants sold a pig-food hopper to the plaintiffs. It was defective. The nuts in it went mouldy. 254 pigs died as a result of eating mouldy nuts. At the time of the contract it was found, as a fact, that the parties could not have foreseen serious illness arising as a result of the consumption of mouldy nuts.
HELD dismissing D's appeal, that it would have been in the contemplation of the parties that there was a real possibility of harm coming to the pigs if their food was made unfit by reason of the condition of the hopper. The fact that they could not foresee the extent of the harm was immaterial and P could recover the cost of his pigs.

ABSTRACT The appellant charterer (T) appealed against a decision ([2007] EWCA Civ 901, [2008] 1 All E.R. (Comm) 685) upholding an arbitrators' ruling on the damages to which the respondent shipowner (M) was entitled following the late return of the ship which T had chartered from it.
ABSTRACT M had let out its ship to T for a period of five to seven months, to end no later than midnight on May 2, 2004. T notified M that the ship would be back no later than then. M therefore contracted to let the ship to new charterers for a period of about four to six months, promising that they could have the ship no later than May 8, 2004. The agreed price of hire was $39,500 a day. The ship was delayed on its last voyage and M did not get it back until May 11, 2004. The new charterers agreed to take the ship, but by then the market had fallen sharply and they would only take it at a reduced price of $31,500 a day. The issue before the arbitrators was whether T was liable to pay only for the use of the ship for the number of days that it was late at the market rate then prevailing or whether, as M had argued, T was liable to pay the difference between what M would have got from the new charter had the ship been returned in time and what it in fact got. The arbitrators, by a majority, adopted the latter approach. They concluded that the loss on the new fixture fell within the first rule in Hadley v Baxendale 156 E.R. 145 as arising "naturally, i.e. according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself". It fell within that rule because it was damage "of a kind which the [charterer], when he made the contract, ought to have realised was not unlikely to result from a breach of contract [by delay in redelivery]". The dissenting arbitrator did not deny that T would have known that M would be very likely to enter into a following fixture during the course of the charter and that late delivery might cause that fixture to be lost. However, he concluded that a reasonable man in T's position would not have understood that he was assuming liability for the risk of the type of loss in question. He stated that the general understanding in the shipping market was that liability was restricted to the difference between the market rate and the charter rate for the overrun period and that "any departure from this rule [is] likely to give rise to a real risk of serious commercial uncertainty which the industry as a whole would regard as undesirable".
SUMMARY When assessing damages for the late redelivery of a chartered vessel, the court should in the usual case restrict the charterer's liability to the difference between the market rate and the charter rate for the overrun period.
HELD Appeal allowed.
HELD In accepting M's submission that what mattered was that the type of loss claimed was foreseeable, the majority arbitrators had applied too crude a test, and it was an error of law to adopt it. The common basis on which the parties had contracted was essential to the rule in Hadley v Baxendale as a whole. In Koufos v C Czarnikow Ltd (The Heron II) [1969] 1 A.C. 350 their Lordships had had well in mind that it was not simply a question of probability but also of what the contracting parties had to be taken to have had in mind, having regard to the nature and object of their business transaction. What mattered was whether the common intention of reasonable parties to a charterparty of this sort would have been that, in the event of a relatively short delay in redelivery, an extraordinary loss, measured over the whole term of the renewed fixture, was, in the words of Lord Reid in The Heron II , "sufficiently likely to result from the breach of contract to make it proper to hold that the loss flowed naturally from the breach or that loss of that kind should have been within [the defaulting party's] contemplation". That would not have been the common intention of reasonable contracting parties. It was contrary to the principle stated in Victoria Laundry (Windsor) v Newman Industries [1949] 2 K.B. 528, and reaffirmed in The Heron II , to suppose that the parties were contracting on the basis that T would be liable for any loss, however large, occasioned by a delay in redelivery in circumstances where it had no knowledge of, or control over, the new fixture entered into by M, Hadley v Baxendale , The Heron II and Victoria Laundry applied.
