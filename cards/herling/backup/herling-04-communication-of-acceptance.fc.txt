/->-_As a general rule, acceptance must be communicated to the offeror, and is deemed effective only from the moment of such communication. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule, and some of them are not entirely clear-cut._
/->-_To decide when acceptance takes effect is a matter of importance. As already seen, it will determine the time up until which a withdrawal of the offer remains an option for the offeror. It will also determine the place at which the contract is concluded, since this is deemed to be the place at which acceptance is received. The place of the contract's making may in turn determine the national law to which it is subject, unless the parties have specifically agreed the governing law, and various procedural consequences may also follow._

CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Acceptance By Conduct
SUMMARY ~*Acceptance By Conduct*~
/->-The broadest exception to the rule that communication of acceptance is required consists in the principle that the offeree's conduct may in certain circumstances validly constitute acceptance of an offer made to him. In unilateral contracts, this exception has in fact assumed the status of a general rule itself.




NAME Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co
CITATION Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (1893) 1 QB 256
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Acceptance By Conduct
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The facts of the case were given in lecture 2. For present purposes it is enough to recall that Mrs Carlill never informed the Carbolic Smoke Ball Company that she was accepting their offer of the £100 reward. On appeal, counsel for the company took this point to argue that there had been no acceptance.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Rejecting the company's submission that there had been no acceptance and therefore no contract, Bowen LJ stated the following: “Then it was said that there was no notification of acceptance of the contract [<i>sic</i>]. One cannot doubt that, as an ordinary rule of law, an acceptance of an offer made ought to be notified to the person who makes the offer, in order that the two minds may come together. Unless this is done, the two minds may be apart, and there is not that consensus which is necessary in English law – I say nothing about the laws of other countries – to make a contract. But there is this clear gloss to be made upon that doctrine, that as notification of acceptance is required for the benefit of the person who makes the offer, the person who makes the offer may dispense with notice to himself if he thinks it desirable to do so, and I suppose there can be no doubt that where a person in an offer made by him to another person, expressly or impliedly intimates a particular mode of acceptance as sufficient to make the bargain binding, it is only necessary for the other person to whom such offer is made to follow the indicated method of acceptance; and if the person making the offer, expressly or impliedly intimates in his offer that it will be sufficient to act on the proposal without communicating acceptance of it to himself, performance of the condition is a sufficient acceptance without notification”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_A minor point – there seems to be some tension here between Bowen LJ's appeal to the need for consensus [ad idem], and his “gloss” upon it. The gloss is founded upon freedom of contract; the parties can agree what they want, and one for whom the law provides a protection (communication) can waive that benefit if he sees fit. No doubt this is fair and pragmatic, but it is difficult to reconcile with some of the more schematic judicial dicta in favour of consensus ad idem. Either that consensus exists, or it does not._
/->-_The nature of the typical offer of a unilateral contract (usually intended as an inducement, as discussed earlier) leads naturally to an inference that the offeror wants action in response to the offer rather than assent. In bilateral contracts this inference is not nearly so natural, but the facts of the case may nevertheless justify it. _
/->-_The next case is a well-known authority showing that acceptance by conduct can occur in a bilateral contract._




NAME Brogden v Metropolitan Railway
CITATION Brogden v Metropolitan Railway (1876) 2 App Cas 666
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Acceptance By Conduct
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Brogden, a coal merchant, had supplied coal to the Metropolitan Railway Company for two years without a formal contract. In order to regularise the situation, the company sent Brogden a draft contract. Brogden filled in various gaps in the contract, added the name of an arbitrator, and returned the form (this was regarded as the making of a counter-offer). The company's manager put the form in his desk. Coal was then ordered and supplied in accordance with the draft contract, until Brogden denied any obligation to make further supplies. The company sued for breach of contract. Held by the House of Lords that a valid contract had come into existence; Brogden's counter-offer had been accepted by the conduct of the company in placing orders for coal on its terms.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-Although the detail which is most commonly remembered from this case is the putting of the draft contract into the desk drawer, be very clear that this was not the acceptance of Brogden's counter-offer. Lord Blackburn, in a passage quoted in most of the casebooks, makes clear that what is required is the doing of “an extraneous act which clenches the matter, and shews beyond all doubt that each side is bound…”. He adds, with reference to the draft document in this case that “if both parties have acted upon that draft and treated it as binding, they will be bound by it”. 
/->-There seem to be different strands within this reasoning. The first amounts to this; if the offeree's response to the offer indicates his acceptance (in the sense that it is verifiable, certain and cannot be withdrawn), then it will stand as an acceptance in law provided the offeror can be deemed to have waived the requirement of communication. The second really consists in the notion that an incomplete negotiation can be overtaken by the parties' subsequent conduct in acting as if they had reached agreement. 
/->-The first of these analyses derogates from the communication rule where it is possible to do so without forfeiting certainty. The second derogates in the name of realism, and reflects the courts' unwillingness to undo bargains upon which the parties have acted. 
/->-As the next case shows, however, there are limits to the use of realism to “suppose” a contract between the parties.




NAME British Steel Corporation v Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co Ltd
CITATION British Steel Corporation v Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co Ltd [1984] 1 All ER 504
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Acceptance By Conduct
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-British Steel received a letter of intent from Cleveland which led them to believe that a contract for the manufacture of steel components would shortly be agreed between the two companies. The letter included a request that British Steel would begin to manufacture the components in the interim, which they did. The parties continued to negotiate, but failed to reach agreement on various matters including the question whose standard terms were to govern. British Steel eventually claimed that no contract had arisen, but that they were entitled to recover reasonable remuneration on a quantum meruit basis for the work which they had done. Cleveland argued that a contract had come into being, under which they counter-claimed damages for late delivery of the components (claimed to be greater than Cleveland's expenses). It was held that there was no contract, and that the restitutionary quantum meruit claim succeeded.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Rejecting Cleveland's submission that a formal contract had arisen from the letter of intent and the action taken by British Steel in response to it, Robert Goff J found that it was impossible to say what the terms of this purported contract were, and that British Steel was not bound to continue work merely because they had started it. Robert Goff J went on to consider whether a unilateral contract had arisen between the parties. He said that it was analytically possible to find the request and conditional promise of payment, and that the mechanism would have the advantage of importing certain statutorily implied terms into the relationship between the parties. However, he concluded that the unilateral contract solution had to be rejected, since the vital issue of whose terms were to govern was wholly dependent on the stalled negotiations for the express bilateral contract which both parties had expected to govern their relationship.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_Does this case in fact set a limit to what can be done by taking a “realistic” view of contract formation, or does it strike a blow for realism? Professor Atiyah takes the first view, and criticizes the Cleveland Bridge decision. However, the contrary view is also arguable. The fact is that parties who choose to act as if they had a contract, when in reality they are still negotiating, take a risk. There was no departure from realism in Robert Goff J's careful attention to the reality of the negotiation between the parties. Instead he rejected the implication of contractual solutions which would have constituted legal fictions, and upheld a claim for expenditure above Cleveland's considerably more remote claim for consequential loss. _

NAME Felthouse v Bindley
CITATION Felthouse v Bindley (1862) 11 CBNS 869
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Acceptance By Silence/Inactivity
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Learning that he and his uncle had been at cross-purposes over price while discussing the sale and purchase of a horse, John Felthouse wrote to his uncle to point out the misunderstanding. In reply, his uncle wrote proposing that they split the difference ( a small amount), adding “If I hear no more about him, I consider the horse mine at £30 15s”. Vitally, John Felthouse did not reply, and no money was paid, but he did instruct an auctioneer employed by him to sell his farming stock at auction that the horse should be kept out of the sale, since it was already sold. In spite of this the horse was sold at auction to a third party. An action in the tort of conversion was brought against the auctioneer by John's uncle, but failed. An acceptance by John of his uncle's offer did not appear on the facts. No title to the horse had vested in the uncle, since no contract had been concluded between him and John.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-Despite the fact that this case can be and often is presented as a matter of common law, it largely turns on a statutory provision. Applying the Statute of Frauds, the court held that there had been no compliance with the requirements of the Act; the alleged bargain between John and his uncle was not in writing, nor had there been payment of the purchase price or delivery of the property. Valid acceptance by conduct could have been found in John's instruction to the auctioneer to keep the horse out of the sale, but this would not have satisfied the Act. In fact, the Statute of Frauds has since largely been repealed, and it can be convincingly argued that this case would now be decided differently. Does it therefore constitute authority for the principle for which it tends to be cited – that silence does not constitute acceptance?
/->-Most commentators emphasise a single expression in the judgment of Willes J; “it is also clear that the uncle had no right to impose upon the nephew a sale of his horse …unless he chose to comply with the condition of writing to repudiate the offer”. Excepting this one remark, which in any event is not a fair reflection of what John's uncle was trying to do, the case turns on the Statute of Frauds. The later appeal judgments in the Court of Exchequer Chamber uphold the first instance decision exclusively on an application of the Act, with no reference to the impermissibility of silence as acceptance.
/->-However, the good sense of Willes J's observation in general terms cannot be contested, since it amounts to a check upon the practice of “inertia selling” – providing goods to consumers and stipulating that if no action is taken to return them within a specified time, they will be deemed to be accepted so that the purchaser owes the price. Even so, the dictum is less apposite than it was in the mid nineteenth century. Regulations have been put in place by Parliament (replacing the <i>Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971</i>) to impose tight limitations on this practice, so that the common law need no longer concern itself to police the area. Every argument for regarding <i>Felthouse v Bindley</i> as a leading case on acceptance by silence suffers on a closer examination; later developments have deprived it of almost all its force.
/->-Notwithstanding all of this, there is one very sound reason for upholding the rule thought to be established by <i>Felthouse v Bindley</i>. The offeree's silence is almost always capable of more than one explanation (eg. forgetfulness). It is contrary to the relatively formal analysis of offer and acceptance preferred by English law to allow an inherently ambiguous type of conduct to lead to mutually binding legal obligations, because it flouts the principle of certainty. Therefore, judicial opinion is against allowing silence to constitute acceptance, though reference is often made to exceptional circumstances in which it may be possible.




NAME The Leonidas D
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-A dispute had arisen in connection with a charterparty, and had been referred to arbitration. Following the appointment of two arbitrators, nothing happened for five and a half years. At the end of that period, the shipowners argued (inter alia) that the arbitration agreement had been mutually abandoned by an agreement to be inferred from the parties' inactivity. The Court of Appeal held that the circumstances did not permit that inference to be made. 
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Robert Goff LJ explained his reasons for rejecting the shipowners' submission in the following terms: “We have here to consider an appeal from a decision that a binding agreement should be inferred from silence and inaction. Silence and inaction by both parties are apparently here considered to be capable of giving rise to an offer by one, and to an acceptance by the other communicated in response to that offer. This is most surprising. We have all been brought up to believe it axiomatic that acceptance of an offer cannot be inferred from silence, save in the most exceptional circumstances (as to which see, for example, G. H. *Treitel*, <i>The Law of Contract</i> (6<sup>th</sup> edn, p. 27). Yet it is here suggested that silence and inaction can give rise both to an offer and to an acceptance; and there do not appear to be any special circumstances, in the silent abandonment of this reference to arbitration, which could justify any departure from general principle. In the absence of special circumstances, silence and inaction by a party to a reference are, objectively considered, just as consistent with his having inadvertently forgotten about the matter; or with his simply hoping that the matter will die a natural death if he does not stir up the other party; or with his office staff, or his agents, or his insurers, or his solicitors, being appallingly slow”. 
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_Robert Goff LJ's recital of potential causes of delay is persuasive, and skillfully crafted in order to persuade. However, his equally plausible reference to one party's hoping that the matter “will die a natural death” rather begs the question. This is indeed what people do. Surely there comes a time when, as a result, the matter is dead. If that is the reality, the law is quite as much at fault if it cannot give it effect as it would be if it failed to take the measure of any other reality in the business world. Or is certainty a superior value, capable of trumping realism?_

NAME Vitol SA v Norelf Ltd
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The intending buyers of a cargo of propane sent a telex to the sellers in which they recorded that since the vessel would complete loading outside the contractually agreed period, they were repudiating the contract. The sellers made no response to this message. An arbitrator later held that the sellers' silence and failure to take further steps to perform the contract had amounted to an acceptance of the buyers' repudiation. This decision was upheld by the House of Lords.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Lord *Steyn* made the following comment on the inferences to be drawn from silence and inactivity: “Sometimes in the practical world of businessmen an omission to act may be as pregnant with meaning as a positive declaration. While the analogy of offer and acceptance is imperfect, it is not without significance that while the general principle is that there can be no acceptance of an offer by silence, our law does in exceptional cases recognize acceptance of an offer by silence. Thus in <i>Rust v Abbey Life Assurance Co Ltd</i> [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 334 the Court of Appeal held that a failure by a proposed insured to reject a proffered insurance policy for seven months justified on its own an inference of acceptance. See also *Treitel* The Law of Contract (9<sup>th</sup> edn, 1995)…. Similarly, in the different field of repudiation, a failure to perform may sometimes be given a colour by special circumstances and may only be explicable to a reasonable person in the position of the repudiating party as an election to accept the repudiation”.

NAME Re Selectmove Ltd
CITATION Re Selectmove Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 474
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Acceptance By Silence/Inactivity
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-Selectmove owed the Inland Revenue large amounts of tax. At a meeting on 15 July, the company's managing director proposed to the collector of taxes that the company should pay tax in future as it fell due, and pay off its arrears in instalments starting in February of the following year. The collector said that he would seek the approval of his superiors, and no more was heard until October, when the Inland Revenue threatened to wind up the company. The company, appealing against the grant of a winding-up petition at first instance, argued (inter alia) that an agreement had come into existence based on the proposal made on 15 July, and the Inland Revenue's prolonged silence in response to it. The company lost the appeal on other grounds, but the Court of Appeal tentatively accepted that an agreement could be formed in the way suggested.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-Peter Gibson LJ drew a distinction between cases where an offeror declares that silence will amount to acceptance, and cases in which the offeree proposes that this meaning should be attached to his silence: “Mr Charles, for the Crown, drew our attention to the general rule that silence will not normally amount to acceptance of an offer since acceptance cannot be inferred from silence alone “save in the most exceptional circumstances” (see [<i>The Leonidas D</i>]). But the authorities that support the general rule are cases where an offeror sought to impose on the offeree a term as to acceptance by silence. […] Where the offeree himself indicates that an offer is to be taken as accepted if he does not indicate to the contrary by an ascertainable time, he is undertaking to speak if he does not want an agreement to be concluded. I see no reason in principle why that should not be an exceptional circumstance such that the offer can be accepted by silence. But it is unnecessary to express a concluded view on this point”.




NAME Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd v Attrill
CITATION Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd v Attrill [2013] EWCA Civ 394
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Acceptance By Silence/Inactivity
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The bank's contract with its employees gave it (a) the power unilaterally to vary the terms of their employment; and (b) an absolute discretion to pay annual discretionary awards (bonuses) to them. As a result of organisational restructuring pending in response to the financial crisis of 2008, bank staff became disaffected, and measures were adopted to try to prevent their mass departure and the consequential collapse of the investment banking division. These included an announcement to staff that a bonus pool of 400 million euros had been created, and that whilst no individual guarantees were given the bonus pool would be distributed. The bank later sought to retreat from this position. The main questions of contract law arising in the subsequent dispute were whether the bank's announcement was an offer made with the intention to create legal relations; and whether it was contractually binding in view of the fact that no acceptance of it had been sought or received from staff.
/->-Held by the Court of Appeal that legal relations had been intended, and that the offer bound the bank despite the absence of acceptance. 
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-“Well established contract theory requires acceptance [...] and there was none here. 
/->-In my view there are at least two related answers to this submission. First, as Lord Justice Bowen observed in the Carbolic Smoke Ball case (supra, p. 269) “... as notification of acceptance is required for the benefit of the person who makes the offer, the person who makes the offer may dispense with notice to himself.” In that case the mode of acceptance was held by implication to be actually performing the conditions attached to the offer. Here, in my view, it is plain that the employer has dispensed with the need for any response to the offer at all. This was a promise without any disadvantage, actual or potential, of any kind to the employees. Nobody hearing the promise made in this announcement would for one moment expect the employee to be able to benefit from it only if he or she positively accepted the offer. It would be a wholly formal and unnecessary exercise; the only sensible implication is that all employees who might potentially benefit from the promise would be deemed to have accepted it.
/->-Second, the nature of the promise is inconsistent with the notion of individual acceptance. It would mean that if, say, a minority of the relevant staff accepted the offer, the employers would be bound to pay the whole of the bonus pool, if only to the minority”.

NAME Eliason v Henshaw
CITATION Eliason v Henshaw (1819) Wheat 225
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Transmission of Acceptance
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-An offer to purchase flour was made by letter. The letter was carried by a waggoner employed by the offeree to carry flour. It included a postscript: “Please write by return of wagon whether you accept our offer”. The offeree instead posted a letter of acceptance to the offeror at Georgetown, which took longer to arrive than would a reply conveyed by wagon. The offeree failed in an action for damages in respect of the offeror's refusal to accept the flour. The purported acceptance, made in this way, had not been valid and therefore no contract had come into existence.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-The United States Supreme Court drew various conclusions from the request for a reply “by return of wagon”. The first was that a valid acceptance would have had to be directed to the place to which the wagon was bound on its return journey, and not to Georgetown. The second was that the manner of communication of acceptance was unimportant. Any means would have sufficed, provided it was as quick (or quicker) as a reply by wagon.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-This case is commented on by Winfield (“Some Aspects of Offer and Acceptance (1939) 55 LQR 516), and by Smith and Thomas. Winfield suggests that if the offeror had received a posted acceptance at the same time or earlier than he would have received a reply by return of wagon, he could not have denied its validity on the ground that he had required a reply to be carried by wagon. Smith and Thomas add that if he had made it clear that only a reply by wagon would do, then the position would be different; if the offeror chooses to place restrictions on what is to constitute a valid acceptance, they will be upheld. If one assumes these propositions to be correct, the situation seems to be this; the courts will analyse contract formation with the assumption that practicality and efficiency are the controlling values behind the mechanics envisaged by the offeror, but if the offeror makes it clear that only one form of communication will amount to a satisfactory response, freedom of contract demands that his stipulation be upheld.
/->-Further values which condition legal analysis of contract formation are certainty (as we have already seen), common sense, and a judgment as to where the risks should lie.




NAME Entores v Miles Far East Corporation
CITATION Entores v Miles Far East Corporation [1955] 2 QB 327
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Transmission of Acceptance
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-This case turned on whether a contract had been made in Holland, from where a telexed message of acceptance had been sent, or in London, where it had been received. The Court of Appeal therefore had to decide at what point the acceptance took effect. It held that acceptance occurred on receipt of the message in London, so that the contract had been made within the jurisdiction.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-*Denning LJ* considered various hypothetical situations in which attempts to communicate acceptance might be disrupted. He laid down as a general rule that where the disruption is apparent to the maker of the acceptance, it will not be valid until it has been repeated. He went on: “In all the instances I have taken so far, the man who sends the message of acceptance knows that it has not been received or he has reason to know it. So he must repeat it. But, suppose that he does not know that his message did not get home. He thinks it has. This may happen if the listener on the telephone does not catch the words of acceptance, but nevertheless does not trouble to ask for them to be repeated: or the ink on the teleprinter fails at the receiving end, but the clerk does not ask for the message to be repeated: so that the man who sends an acceptance reasonably believes that his message has been received. The offeror in such cases is clearly bound, because he will be estopped from saying that he did not receive the message of acceptance. It is his own fault that he did not get it. But if there should be a case where the offeror without any fault on his part does not receive the message of acceptance – yet the sender of it reasonably believes it has got home when it has not – then I think there is no contract”.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_The reference here to estoppel requires explanation and a brief comment. Lord Denning, as you will come to see, was more closely associated with this rule than any other judge. Estoppel, at its inception, was a rule of evidence which prevented a party to litigation saying something in court which would admittedly be both relevant and true, but which it would be unfair to allow him to maintain since the parties conducted themselves on a different basis. In the passage above, Denning LJ is using it in a broad sense to indicate the unfairness of allowing the offeror to set up his own carelessness as a defence. Note the result; despite the fact that the offeror did not receive notice of the acceptance, he is to be treated as if he did. A commonsense account of what happened is here displaced by a legal fiction, in the name of fairness._
/->-_In the next case the court again departs from a purely factual analysis of communication in order to achieve fairness._

NAME The Brimnes
CITATION The Brimnes [1975] QB 929
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Transmission of Acceptance
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The case turned on whether a notice withdrawing a ship from service had been received before or after an instalment of hire was paid. The notice of withdrawal had been sent by telex between 17.30 and 18.00, but had not been seen by the defendants until the following morning. It was held to be the defendants' own fault that they had not seen the withdrawal at or shortly after the time it was sent, since they must either have left the office early or failed to pay attention to their telex machine. The withdrawal was therefore deemed to have been communicated between 17.30 and 18.00, since it would have been received then in the ordinary course of events. The case admittedly concerns the termination of a contract rather than its formation, but the issue in both instances is legally valid communication.




NAME Postal Rule
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Postal Rule
SUMMARY ~*Postal Rule*~
/->-The concern for efficiency, practicality, certainty and common sense, balanced (if necessary) against fairness, gives way to what at first sight appears a radically different approach where a letter of acceptance has been posted. A simple but arbitrary rule is imposed; a posted letter of acceptance takes effect at the moment it is posted. On closer inspection, it will be seen that although there is an arbitrary aspect to this rule, in fact the usual legal values are present in an uneasy association with the rule itself. However, those values may sometimes be asserted to justify a departure from it.
/->-The usual authority given for the rule is <i>Adams v Lindsell</i> (1818) 1 B & Ald 681, where the rule is applied in passing, really, but the court nevertheless takes the opportunity to buttress it on the grounds of finality. The justification is this; if the normal rule requiring actual communication were to apply to acceptance by post, so that the offeror became bound only when he knew of the offeree's acceptance, then it could equally be maintained that the offeree should only be bound when he learnt that his acceptance had reached the offeror, and so on ad infinitum. 
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_However, this is hardly a convincing argument. There is a marked difference between the respective burdens of the two contingencies here being compared. It is one thing to be bound without yet knowing whether the offeree wishes to accept (he may or he may not). It would be a much lesser burden for the offeree to be bound without yet knowing whether his letter of acceptance has in fact arrived (it is highly likely that it will have done so). So even at its inception, the basis for the rule is shaky. Why, then, did it find its way into English law?_
/->-_A fascinating answer is given in Simon Gardner's article “Trashing with Trollope: A Deconstruction of the Postal Rules in Contract” (1992) 12 OJLS 170. In 1840, the penny post was introduced. It caused a communications revolution as fundamental as the development of the mobile phone or email when people realised that the delivery of a letter had become a virtually certain consequence of posting it. Gardner continues: “This contemporary perception may have played a substantial part in the decision in which the courts established the acceptance rule in the 1840s. In these terms, the basis of the rule might have been not a preference for posting over delivery as the dispositive act. It might have been an idea that delivery was self-evidently important, but that in the newly prevailing conditions posting and delivery were little different: that once posted, a letter was as good as delivered. But there is a certain weakness about this. Despite the great improvements in efficiency…equating posting with delivery on purely empirical grounds would have been a little foolish: indeed, the reason why these cases came to court at all was because the equation had failed._
/->-_However, some ... other innovations added a further dimension to this constructive identification of posting with delivery. One was a dramatic shift towards prepayment of postage. In March 1839, only 14% of letters sent by the London General Post were prepaid, leaving 86% for which payment had to be collected from the addressee. By February 1840 these figures had been precisely reversed. Prepayment was endorsed by none other than Queen Victoria herself, abandoning the privilege of free use of the mail. A year later still, the unpaid element had fallen further to 8%. A second was the further facilitation of prepayment by the introduction in 1840 of the self-adhesive postage stamp; another measure which entranced the public. Of the February 1841 prepaid total of 92%, 45% comprised letters for which the payment was by this means. A third important innovation was the cutting of letter-boxes in front doors of houses, so that letters no longer needed to be handed to their addressee; this too captured the public imagination._
/->-_Taken together, these measures may have great significance. Until 1840, the delivery of a letter typically required that the addressee should manually receive it and pay for it. This was not, of course, a significant practical hurdle, but it sat in symbolic contrast with the new position, whereby the sender had only to affix his stamp and post the letter, and it would go through to its destination without further subvention from outside the system. So these three innovations of 1840 may be seen as predicating a radically new perception of the nature of the post: the notional equation of the posting of a letter with its delivery. There may thus have been a very powerful influence towards the courts affirming the acceptance rule in the way that they did in that decade”._
/->-_Gardner expresses himself with due caution, but his thesis is attractive and persuasive. If he is right, then the reason for the postal rule lies not in one of the later theories given by way of apology for it (eg. the entirely flawed notion that the Postal Service is the agent of both the parties), but rather in the enthusiasm of the moment. This was an enthusiasm which proved capable of leading the courts away from their usual insistence on consensus ad idem. After all, if two cross-offers do not make a contract, even though each party to the negotiation must become aware that the other is in perfect agreement with him, how can offer and acceptance do so when only one party knows of the acceptance? _
/->-_A more neutral explanation for the rule follows if one notes that in posting a letter of acceptance, the offeree (in the language of Lord Blackburn in Brogden's case, above) has done “an extraneous act which clenches the matter”. He cannot get his letter back. The moment of posting is therefore the point in time at which he commits himself. The postal rule gives recognition to that fact, and is in accordance with English law's usual tendency to make the concluding of contracts as simple as it can reasonably be._
/->-_One nineteenth century judge, George *Bramwell*, fought a rearguard action against the postal rule. Probably he saw himself, and his predecessor the Lord Chief Justice Brian, as the few who had not lost their juristic wits. _

NAME Household Fire Insurance Co v Grant
CITATION Household Fire Insurance Co v Grant (1879) 4 Ex D 216
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Postal Rule
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-The defendant made an offer to buy shares in the company, and paid a deposit on the shares. The company secretary, by way of acceptance, made out a letter of allotment and posted it to the defendant in Swansea, but it never arrived. The company later went into liquidation, and the liquidator sued the defendant for the balance of the price of the shares. The Court of Appeal held that a contract had come into existence upon the posting of the share allotment, despite the fact that it never reached the defendant. Thesiger LJ suggested that this ruling would not cause great hardship, since the post generally did not fail, the offeror could choose to stipulate that acceptance would only bind him upon communication (ousting the postal rule), and if he did not hear from the offeree, he could make enquiries of him. 
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-This, however, was too much for *Bramwell LJ*, who dissented: “If...posting a letter which does not reach is a sufficient communication of acceptance of an offer, it is equally a communication of everything else which may be communicated by post, for example, notice to quit. It is impossible to hold, if I offer my landlord to sell him some hay and he writes accepting my offer, and in the same letter gives me notice to quit, and posts his letter which, however, does not reach me, that he has communicated to me his acceptance of my offer, but not his notice to quit. Suppose a man has paid his tailor by cheque or banknote, and posts a letter containing a cheque or banknote to his tailor, which never reaches, is the tailor paid? If he is, would he be if he had never been paid before in that way? Suppose a man is in the habit of sending cheques and banknotes to his banker by post, and posts a letter containing cheques and banknotes, which never reaches. Is the banker liable? Would he be if this was the first instance of a remittance of this sort? In the cases I have supposed, the tailor and banker may have recognised this form of remittance by sending back receipts and putting the money to the credit of the remitter. Are they liable with that? Are they liable without it? The question then is, is posting a letter which is never received a communication to the person addressed, or an equivalent, or something which dispenses with it? It is for those who say it is to make good their contention. I ask why is it? My answer beforehand to any argument that may be urged is that it is not a communication, and that there is no agreement to take it as an equivalent for or to dispense with a communication. That those who affirm the contrary say the thing which is not. That if Brian C.J. had had to adjudicate on the case, he would deliver the same judgment as that reported. That because a man, who may send a communication by post or otherwise, sends it by post, he should bind the person addressed, although the communication never reaches him, while he would not so bind him if he had sent it by hand, is impossible. There is no reason in it; it is simply arbitrary. I ask whether anyone who thinks so is prepared to follow that opinion to its consequence....
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_If you wonder what lies behind Bramwell LJ's obvious indignation, it is worth considering this passage from the judgment of Thesiger LJ (in the majority in the same case): “How then can a casualty in the post, whether resulting in delay, which in commercial transactions is often as bad as no delivery, or in non-delivery, unbind the parties or unmake the contract? To me it appears that in practice a contract complete upon the acceptance of an offer being posted, but liable to be put an end to by an accident in the post, would be more mischievous than a contract only binding upon the parties to it upon the acceptance actually reaching the offeree, and I can see no principle of law from which such an anomalous contract can be deduced”. Quite; but of course this eloquently shows why the simple solution would be to apply the ordinary rule that acceptance must be communicated, and abandon the postal rule._
/->-_Several of Bramwell LJ's examples do not work, although only for a reason at which he would probably have scoffed; the operation of the postal rule is confined to acceptances of offers, and has no application to any other situation. That said, he was certainly right to remark that the rule is an arbitrary one. The cases that follow, however, tend to place conditions on its applicability. In the result, the rule may not be English contract law's greatest ornament, but on the other hand it is difficult to envisage it causing very much harm._

NAME Henthorn v Fraser
CITATION Henthorn v Fraser (1892) 2 Ch 27
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Postal Rule
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-A written offer to sell some houses was handed to the plaintiff. The next day, a letter withdrawing the offer was posted to him. Before the withdrawal arrived, the plaintiff wrote a letter accepting the offer. The withdrawal reached the plaintiff's house just over an hour later, but was not opened until the next day. The plaintiff applied for specific performance of the contract of sale; its refusal by the judge at first instance was overturned on appeal. The acceptance had bound upon posting, so creating an enforceable contract. Lord Herschell stated a general test for the applicability of the postal rule: “Where the circumstances are such that it must have been within the contemplation of the parties that, according to the ordinary usages of mankind, the post might by used as a means of communicating the acceptance of an offer, the acceptance is complete as soon as it is posted”.
SUMMARY ~*Discussion*~
/->-In <i>Henthorn v Fraser</i>, the defendants unsuccessfully argued that the postal rule should not apply on the facts of the case, because the offer letter had been handed to the plaintiff rather than posted. Since the decision rejects that argument, it might be considered something of a boost to the fortunes of the rule, broadening its applicability. In fact the opposite is true. By making it clear that the applicability of the rule does not turn exclusively on the means used to communicate the offer, the judgments allow the conclusion that by no means every posting of an offer will apply the rule to a posted reply. Furthermore, Lord Herschell's test may sound fairly expansive on a first reading, but later courts have easily found circumstances in which it will not be satisfied, or will not resolve the matter at issue.




NAME Holwell Securities Ltd v Hughes
CITATION Holwell Securities Ltd v Hughes [1974] 1 WLR 155
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Postal Rule
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-An option (an irrevocable offer) to purchase property was granted to the plaintiffs. It provided that “the said option shall be exercisable by notice in writing to the Intending Vendor at any time within six months from the date hereof”. During that period, the plaintiffs wrote to the defendant to exercise the option, but the letter never arrived. The plaintiffs sought an order of specific performance. It was refused at first instance and on appeal. On the true construction of the offer, nothing less than actual communication of acceptance would bind the defendants to a contract of sale.
SUMMARY ~*Detail*~
/->-The reason for the decision on appeal is given by Russell LJ: “In the present case, the parties here contemplated that the postal service might be used to communicate acceptance of the offer (by exercise of the option); and I agree with that. But that is not and cannot be the end of the matter. In any case, before one can find that the basic principle of the need for communication of acceptance to the offeror is displaced by this artificial concept of communication by the act of posting, it is necessary that the offer is in its terms consistent with such displacement and not one which by its terms points rather in the direction of actual communication….
/->-The relevant language here is, “the said option shall be exercisable by notice in writing to the Intending Vendor…”, a very common phrase in an option agreement. There is, of course, nothing in that phrase to suggest that notification to the defendant could not be made by post. But the requirement of “notice…to”, in my judgment is language which should be taken expressly to assert the ordinary situation in law that acceptance requires to be communicated or notified to the offeror, and is inconsistent with the theory that acceptance can be constituted by the act of posting…”.
/->-In addition to establishing that the postal rule may be expressly (or impliedly) ousted by the language of the offer, <i>Holwell v Hughes</i> imposes a further limitation on its operation. The limitation is not uncontroversial, but in the following passage, Lawton LJ contrives to dovetail it quite neatly into Lord Herschell's general test: “Does the [postal] rule apply in <i>all</i> cases where one party makes an offer which both he and the person with whom he was dealing must have expected the post to be used as a means of accepting it? In my judgment, it does not. First, it does not apply when the express terms of the offer specify that the acceptance must reach the offeror….Secondly, it probably does not operate if its application would produce manifest inconvenience and absurdity. This is the opinion set out in Cheshire and Fifoot's <i>Law of Contract</i> (8<sup>th</sup> ed., 1972), p. 43. It was the opinion of *Bramwell* B as is seen by his judgment in <i>British & American Telegraph Co v Colson</i> ((1871) LR 6 Exch 108), and his opinion is worthy of consideration even though the decision in that case was overruled by this court in <i>Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant</i>. The illustrations of inconvenience and absurdity which *Bramwell* B gave are as apt today as they were then…. In my judgment, the factors of inconvenience and absurdity are but illustrations of a wider principle, namely, that the rule does not apply if, having regard to the subject-matter under consideration, the negotiating parties cannot have intended that there should be a binding agreement until the party accepting an offer or exercising an option had in fact communicated the acceptance or exercise to the other”.
/->-It is now established that the rule will not apply to a misaddressed letter of acceptance.

NAME L J Korbetis v Transgrain Shipping BV
CITATION L J Korbetis v Transgrain Shipping BV [2005] EWHC 1345
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Postal Rule
SUMMARY ~*Overview*~
/->-In response to a fax offering to appoint one of three nominated arbitrators, a shipowner's agent sent a fax to accept the offer, but made a mistake entering the international dialling code so that the fax never reached the intended recipient. Toulson J, distinguishing <i>Adams v Lindsell</i> and <i>Henthorn v Fraser</i>, held that those cases did not govern the misdirection of a letter (or fax) of acceptance, and that the postal rule should not apply to a misdirected communication.
SUMMARY ~*A closer look*~
/->-_Since this judgment is recent, it is worth looking at it in some detail. It would also seem to be of importance in that it assumes that the postal rule can apply to faxes; this issue was previously thought to be unresolved._
/->-*(11)* If the letter is wrongly addressed, very different considerations apply. Common sense dictates that it is unfair to the intended recipient that he should be bound by something which he is unlikely to receive because of the fault of the sender. Moreover, if he is to be so bound, such a rule would have the potential to give to the careless would-be acceptor an unfair advantage. Suppose that the would-be acceptor realises that the letter or fax has been sent to the wrong address or number. On the owners' argument, a contract would already have come into existence. In the practical world, the acceptor would then have an option whether to reveal the contract to the offeror, or to keep silent about it. If the market had moved, this could be a valuable option. The would-be acceptor, in that situation, would also have the opportunity to nurse his option by waiting to see how the market moved before deciding whether to reveal the existence of the contract. Even if the law crafted some form of rule of good faith to prohibit a party from acting in such a way, such a rule could in the nature of things be difficult to enforce. It is not hard to envisage circumstances in which only the would-be acceptor would know when he discovered the true position.
/->-*(12)* Mr. Lewis submitted that in such situations there should be no firm rule of law, as in the ordinary posting rule, but that it should be for the court to decide on a case by case basis what result most fairly suited the facts. I do not accept that submission. Rules about offer and acceptance ought to be clear, so that parties may know where they stand. A situation in which it is unclear whether or not a contract has been formed until a court decides in the exercise of some form of general discretion whether or not a contract has been formed would be unsatisfactory. 
/->-*(15)* The topic of misdirected letters of acceptance has been considered by text book writers. Chitty, at paragraph 2-056, has the following passage:
@"Misdirected letter of acceptance. A letter of acceptance may be lost or delayed because it bears a wrong or an incomplete address, or because it is not properly stamped. Normally such defects would be due to the carelessness of the offeree, and although there is no English authority precisely on point, it is submitted that the postal rule should not apply to such cases. Although an offeror may have to take the risk of accidents in the post, it would be unreasonable to impose on him the further risk of the acceptor's carelessness. These arguments do not apply where the misdirection is due to the fault of the offeror, e.g. where his own address is incompletely or illegibly given in the offer itself. In such a case, the offeror shall not be allowed to rely on the fact that the acceptance was misdirected, except perhaps where his error in stating his own address was obvious to the offeree, for in such a case the offeror's fault would not be the effective cause of the misdirection of the acceptance. It is submitted that a misdirected acceptance should take effect, if at all, at the time which is least favourable to the party responsible for the misdirection."_
/->-_“I agree with that general approach, because it seems to me to correspond with principle and justice”._
/->-_It is interesting to see what appears to be express judicial approval for the last sentence of the passage above from Chitty on Contracts. The opinion expressed there is that of *Treitel*, previously editor of Chitty, and it went beyond the authorities until the Korbetis case. Is it really the business of the courts to decide the moment at which acceptance takes effect with a view to doing the maximum damage to the party responsible for misaddressing an envelope? The competing view, of course, would simply be that the misdirected acceptance is no longer covered by the postal rule, and therefore binds upon communication, provided the offer is still open for acceptance. _
/->-_On the ordinary rule, that acceptance must be communicated in order to become binding, a written acceptance could be countermanded before the moment of communication. Technically, an attempt to do so after communication could be treated as an anticipatory breach of contract. On the postal rule, there would seem to be no opportunity to countermand once the acceptance is committed to the post._
/->-_However, it is also necessary to consider the fact of the matter. Since there clearly will be a period between the posting of acceptance and its communication to the offeror, there are bound to be situations in which the offeree would wish to countermand his acceptance during that period. What is more, it will often be a simple matter to accomplish it in factual terms, for example by a phone call pre-empting the letter's delivery._
/->-_There is no clear authority on whether the postal rule prevails in this situation or not. The issue is considered at greatest length by Treitel, who favours the application of the postal rule, although for reasons of policy rather than slavish adherence to logic. His concern is the same as that canvassed by Toulson J in the <i>Korbetis</i> case above. If it were possible for the offeree to write and post a letter of acceptance, and pending its arrival be free to countermand it by some speedier means of communication, the offeree would effectively be able to speculate at the offeror's expense (see Treitel, para 2.036). One may doubt whether this concern is realistic, given that it is unlikely that the postal rule would apply in the first place in a market sufficiently volatile to make speculation possible. In addition, as Treitel fairly points out, where the first the offeror knows of the offeree's response to his offer is that it is rejected, it would seem odd to insist that the earlier acceptance must prevail. To do so could well be an example of the “inconvenience and absurdity” which Lawton LJ recognised in <i>Holwell v Hughes</i>._
/->-_*Bramwell LJ*, dissenting in <i>Household Fire Insurance Co v Grant</i>, took a view on this problem: “It was said, if he send [the letter] by hand, it is revocable, but not if he sends it by post, which makes the difference. But it is revocable when sent by post, not that the letter can be got back, but its arrival might be anticipated by a letter by hand or telegram, and there is no case to show that such an anticipation would not prevent the letter from biding, It would be a most alarming thing to say that it would”._
