NAME Contractual Duties as Consideration
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel
SUMMARY *Intro*
@Performance already owed by promisee to promisor is *not good consideration* for promise of more pay. |Stilk v Myrick|.
@Unless the performance in question would really be *new* duties. |Hartley v Ponsonby|. 

SUMMARY _However_ --
@Since |Williams v Roffey|, performance of *services expected to fall short* (and in doing so, to cause detriment to the other party) might be *construed as conferring a benefit* on the other party (of avoiding the detriment), and therefore be *good consideration*.
@But only in contracts for services. Not, e.g., repaying money. |Re Selectmove - PE|.

SUMMARY *Part-Payment of Debt*
/_Is *not* good consideration_ --
@For a promise to forgive the full amount |Foakes v Beer|, confirming the rule in |Pinnel's Case|.
@@ Except if *not yet due* |Pinnel's Case|.

SUMMARY _It *is*, though, if proffered_ --
@*In another place* |Vanbergen v St. Edmunds|.
@*By a third party* |Hirachand Punamchand v Temple|.

NAME Stilk v Myrick
CITATION Stilk v Myrick (1809) 2 Camp 317; 6 Esp 129
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations as Consideration
HELD Performance of a contractual obligation already owed by promisee to promisor cannot provide consideration for a new promise, which, by consequence, will not be enforceable by the promisee.



NAME Hartley v Ponsonby
CITATION Hartley v Ponsonby (1857) 7 E&B 872
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations as Consideration
HELD Should a promise purporting to be in exchange for performance of existing contractual obligations entail, in point of fact, performance for which the contract does _not_ provide, a new contract will have been established, and the promise will be enforceable.  The rule that existing contractual duties are not good consideration for such a promise cannot therefore apply in such circumstances.



NAME Williams v Roffey
CITATION Williams v Roffey Bros [1991] 1 QB 1
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Evasion of the Rule in Stilk v Myrick
HELD In a contract to supply goods or services, if the inadequacy of the performance of one party comes to the attention of the other, who then promises additional payment, should the performance be completed adequately and on time; the benefit the adequate and timely completion of performance would confer (e.g., by avoiding a penalty under another contract) will be good consideration for the promise, which in consequence will be enforceable.





NAME Re Selectmove - PE
CITATION Re Selectmove Ltd [1995] 2 All ER 531
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Evasion of the Rule in Stilk v Myrick
HELD The recent finding that performance of existing contractual duties can be good consideration for a promise, if such duties are unlikely to be fulfilled on time, causing a detriment to the other party -- does _not_ apply to situations where the performance in question is the repaying of a debt.


NAME Pinnel's Case
CITATION Pinnel's Case (1602) 5 Rep 117a
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations as Consideration; Part Payment of a Debt as Consideration
HELD Part-payment of a debt _on the due day_ is not good consideration for a promise to discharge the debt. Should it come _before_, or _be made in another place_, however, it may be.

CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations as Consideration; Part Payment of a Debt as Consideration

NAME Vanbergen v St Edmunds
CITATION Vanbergen v St Edmunds Properties (1933)
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Existing Contractual Obligations as Consideration; Part Payment of a Debt as Consideration

CITATION Societe Italo-Belge v Palm and Vegetable Oils, Malaysia (The Post Chaser) [1982] All ER 19
CATEGORY Towards Promissory Estoppel; Characteristics of Promissory Estoppel; Reliance and Inequity
