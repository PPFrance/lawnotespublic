SUMMARY Since misrepresentation and misstatement are quite distinct from actions for breach of contract, they have their own terminology. A selection from it is set out below for ready reference and to clear up any initial queries, even though several of these terms will not be relevant until the second of these two lectures on misrepresentation.

SUMMARY *Reliance*
