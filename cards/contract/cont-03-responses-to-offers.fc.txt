@An enquiry following an offer which does not evince new terms does _not_ do so. |Stevenson, Jacques v McLean|.

/
@The last to present terms makes the offer, for which acceptance may be by conduct. |BRS v Arthur Crutchley|.
@A term purporting to prospectively exclude imposition of other party's terms is good only for as long as not implicitly cancelled by other party's presentation of terms. |Butler v Ex-Cell-O|, Denning.
@The parties' intentions about whose terms apply is a matter for objective evaluation, even if contradicted by prior dealing. |Tekdata v Amphenol|.


SUMMARY *Withdrawal and Lapse*

NAME Hyde v Wrench
CITATION Hyde v Wrench (1840) 3 Beav 334
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Counter-Offer
FLAGS Key
HELD Responding to an offer with a suggestion of a lower price cancels the original offer and makes a new one. The original offer cannot then validly be accepted. 



NAME Stevenson, Jacques v MacLean
CITATION Stevenson, Jacques v MacLean (1880) 5 QBD 346
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Counter-Offer
FLAGS Key
HELD An enquiry in response to an offer is not a counter-offer, therefore does not terminate the original offer. The difference between a counter-offer and an enquiry may be discerned by asking whether the response leaves open the possibility of accepting the offer -- or shows an intention to modify the terms.

NAME Gibson - Counter-Offers
FLAGS Key
CITATION Gibson v Manchester CC (Counter-Offers) [1978] 1 WLR 520
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Counter-Offer
HELD A response to an offer _enquiring_ about the possibility of new terms rather than _proposing_ new terms, will not be a counter offer.



NAME BRS v Arthur Crutchley
AKA BRS v AVC
CITATION BRS v Arthur Crutchley Ltd [1968] 1 All ER 811
FLAGS Key
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Battle of the Forms
HELD The last set of terms and conditions presented by a party will govern a contract, should the other party be deemed by conduct to have accepted them, as by doing so, the first party has proposed different terms, and has therefore made a counter-offer, annulling the first.



NAME Butler v Ex-Cell-O
AKA Ex-Cell-O
FLAGS Key
CITATION Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp [1979] 1 WLR 401
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Battle of the Forms
HELD Prospectively entrenching the operation one's own terms and conditions will only succeed in doing so while the offer of which they are a part is valid. As soon as the other party makes a counter-offer, the purported term ceases to have any relevance. 



NAME Tekdata v Amphenol
AKA Tekdata
CITATION Tekdata Interconnections Ltd v Amphenol Ltd [2009] EWCA Civ 1209
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Battle of the Forms
FLAGS Key
HELD Modern authority for the standard analysis in 'battle of the forms' cases. The "last shot" wins even should there be contradictory evidence from the business context and the parties' prior dealings as to which set of terms and conditions _was_ intended to govern. 



NAME Routledge v Grant
CITATION Routledge v Grant (1828) 4 Bing 653
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal and Lapse
FLAGS Key
HELD An offer valid for a certain period can nevertheless be withdrawn by the offeror before the period elapses -- who, there being no acceptance and consideration, is not bound.


NAME Mountford v Scott
CITATION Mountford v Scott [1975] All ER 198
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal and Lapse
FLAGS Key
HELD If the prospective offeree of an offer valid during a certain period only has _paid_ for the chance to accept, then he has paid for an option to contract, and the principle offer cannot validly be withdrawn before the period elapses.



NAME Byrne v Van Tienhoven
CITATION Byrne v Van Tienhoven (1880) 5 CPD 344
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal and Lapse
HELD The withdrawal of an offer must be communicated to the offeree _effectively_. The postal rule does not apply to such communication. Were it to do so, the sender of an acceptance by post would not know whether the offeror had received it before sending a withdrawal.



NAME Dickinson v Dodds
CITATION Dickinson v Dodds (1876) 2 Ch 463
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal and Lapse
FLAGS Key; Treitel
HELD Communication to the offeree of an offer's withdrawal may be indirect, as long as the offeree knows of it. Should such an offeree then purport to accept, doing so would itself demonstrate the absence of a consensus ad idem, and could not therefore be effective.


NAME Shuey v United States
CITATION Shuey v United States (1865) 92 US 73
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal and Lapse
FLAGS Key
HELD An offer made publicly will be held to have been validly withdrawn, if done so by the same means. There is no requirement, however, that such withdrawal should have been seen by anyone in particular, e.g., someone engaged in performing the action for the offer's acceptance.


NAME Victoria Hotel v Montefiore
CITATION Ramsgate Victoria Hotel v Montefiore (1866) LR 1 Ex 109
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Withdrawal and Lapse
HELD An offer that is not explicitly of validity for a limited period will nevertheless be deemed to have elapsed, invalidating a purported acceptance coming much later.


NAME Williams v Carwardine
CITATION Williams v Carwardine (1833) 5 C & P 566
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; Knowledge of Offer
HELD An action conforming to the requirement for acceptance of a unilateral offer was held to have accepted the contract, even though the person was unaware of the offer. 


NAME Tinn v Hoffman
CITATION Tinn v Hoffman & Co (1873) 29 LT 271
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; Knowledge of Offer; Cross-offers
SUMMARY Parties treated by post about sale of 800 tons of iron. One party sent letter offering sale at 69s/ton. Before that letter arrived, the other party sent letter offering purchase at 69s/ton. Second letter held by majority of court to be counter offer. But in obiter, judgement that offers crossed in the post do not form a contract. Further communication would have been necessary (from either party) for a contract.
SUMMARY Blackburn J expressed the opinion that it would go against established practice to admit this concatenation of circumstances as a contract.
SUMMARY Honeyman J dissented, as the parties were plainly ad idem.
SUMMARY The impression is given that the concrete of the principles of contract law had not, by this time, wholly firmed and dried.
HELD Functionally identical crossed-offers do not form a contract.



NAME R v Clarke
CITATION R v Clarke (1927) 40 CLR 227
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; Knowledge of Offer
FLAGS McKendrick
HELD A unilateral contract cannot be validly accepted by someone unaware of its existence -- especially if they happen to be a wanted man.



NAME Luxor v Cooper
CITATION Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd v Cooper [1941] AC 108
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; In Unilateral Contracts
FLAGS Key
HELD The traditional view, that a unilateral offer is validly accepted when its specified action is _complete_, will prevail when the action entails no significant detriment to the offeree distinguishable from an _ordinary business risk_.

NAME Errington v Errington
CITATION Errington v Errington and Woods [1952] 1 KB 290
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; In Unilateral Contracts
FLAGS Key; Denning
HELD Should the action for acceptance of a unilateral offer entail a significant detriment to the offeree, then the offer may be deemed to have been accepted when its performance _begins_ -- by contrast to the traditional approach, in which acceptance occurs when the action is complete.


NAME Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees Ltd
CITATION Daulia Ltd v Four Millbank Nominees Ltd [1978] Ch 231
CATEGORY Responses to Offers; Acceptance; In Unilateral Contracts
FLAGS Key
HELD Once the offeree has started to perform the action for acceptance of a unilateral offer, its offeror may not effect withdrawal by scotching the offeree's performance.
