NAME Communication of Acceptance
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance
SUMMARY Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror. |Holwell v Hughes|, apart from _unilateral_ offers. |Carlill - Acceptance|.


SUMMARY *By Conduct*
/_Acts may validly show acceptance, |Brogden|, but only if offer does in fact exist. |British Steel v Cleveland Bridge|._ 
@Acceptance may be demonstrated by _acts_ rather than words, |Brogden|.
@Not by putting the offer in a drawer, but by _acting on it_.
@But only if there was an offer in the first place. |British Steel v Cleveland Bridge|.

SUMMARY *By Silence/Inaction*
@Offers declaring themselves accepted by the offeree's _silence_ are not valid, |Felthouse v Bindley|. 
@@Thus saving a recipient of frequent and multiple offers from going to the trouble of explicitly rejecting.
@Silence of both parties will _not_ amount to abandonment of a contractual undertaking. |The Leonidas D|.
@@They may arise through mutual unexpressed wish that matter will forget about them, "die a natural death." 
@@Or through any of usual reasons of administrative bungling, indecision, downright _sloth_, etc.
@Repudiation of a contract in breach will, nevertheless, be deemed to be "accepted" by the other party's silence.
@Acceptance subject to no indication to contrary before a given date--and remains silent--the offer validly accepted after that date. |Re Selectmove|.

SUMMARY *Means of Transmission*
/_Offeror may nominate exclusive mode: |Eliason v Henshaw|, |Mulcaire v News Group|.  Electronic acceptance valid only on receipt: |Entores v Miles|._ 
@An offeror is free to stipulate the means by which acceptance is to be communicated. |Eliason v Henshaw|.
@Acceptance transmitted electronically is valid when received. |Entores v Miles|.
@An offeror allowing electronic acceptance may not rely on failure to operate device. |The Brimnes|. 

SUMMARY *Postal Rule*
@"Posting" means handing to the control of the post office. |Adams v Linsell|.
%_Either by_ --
@ Popping it into a pillar box.
@ Handing to an employee _authorised to receive mail_. 
@ Cf. handed to a postman, which _wouldn't_ count. |Re London and Northern Bank|.
SUMMARY _It applies_ --
@Even if the letter never arrives. |Household Fire Insurance v Grant|.
@Where parties could reasonably be said to have contemplated that acceptance might be posted. |Henthorn v Fraser|.
SUMMARY _It does *not* apply_ --
@When the offer's language implicitly "ousts" by requiring _notice_ of acceptance (which necessitates the offeror being _made aware_). |Holwell v Hughes|.
@When misaddressed. |Korbetis v Transgrain Shipping|.
@To _immediate_ electronic communication. |Entores v Miles|. 
@To email. |Greenclose v Nat West|.
@To communication _other_ than acceptance.

SUMMARY *Postal Rule: withdrawal of acceptance?*
@ No authority for whether, when the A accepts by post _but subsequently withdraws that acceptance_ in a manner reaching the offeror _before the acceptance_, whether that withdrawal is effective or not.
@The deductive approach would be that acceptance is binding once _posted_, so subsequent withdrawal is _ineffective_, whether reaching offeror before or after acceptance does. 
@@ But that would be bloody silly.

CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Acceptance By Silence/Inactivity
FLAGS Treitel
HELD An agreement to abandon a course of action on which parties to a contract engaged, such as arbitration, may not be inferred from the protracted silence of both parties.

CITATION Holwell Securities Ltd v Hughes [1974] 1 WLR 155
CATEGORY Communication of Acceptance; Postal Rule
FLAGS Bramwell
HELD The postal rule may be implicitly ousted by the language of an offer, such as a requirement to give _notice_ of acceptance to the offeror. Even should the accepted test for the postal rule be met -- that acceptance by post was contemplated -- the postal rule will not apply. The postal rule will not be imposed, even when logical to do so on application of precedent, when that would lead to 'manifest inconvenience and absurdity.'
