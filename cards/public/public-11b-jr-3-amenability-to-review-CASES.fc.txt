NAME Amenability to Review - Learning outcomes
SUMMARY Attentive students should have acquired:
++ A basis for building a relatively sophisticated understanding of how the supervisory jurisdiction has broadened
++ A grasp of how modern courts determine whether institutions/ functions are subject to review
++ Understanding of the role which the public/private law distinction has played in the growth of public law
++ A familiarity with the leading cases on this aspect of administrative law 
++ A basis on which to develop detailed knowledge of the issues raised by this topic through further research
SUMMARY This lecture considers the way in which courts have responded to two connected issues: what bodies, and what functions, are subject to judicial review.  Since the scope of the supervisory jurisdiction is determined by the courts themselves, the lecture deals almost exclusively with the lines of cases by which these limits have been set.  It also explains the “exclusivity principle” requiring public law matters to be litigated in public law proceedings, and charts the cases in which the practical disadvantages of the principle have been mitigated.
