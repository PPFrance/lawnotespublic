SUMMARY The 160,000 charities currently registered with the Charities Commission collectively rake in ~£52bn pa. Not just for |charitable trusts| -- any flavours of company or partnership can have this status.
SUMMARY ~*Legal Basis*~
/The |Charities Act 2006| and the basically identical |Charities Act 2011| are both consolidating statutes which explicitly declare the continuing validity and applicability of the existing law.
SUMMARY ~*Advantages*~
/There are both *legal* advantages, but more significantly, *financial* ones.
SUMMARY *Legal* 
@Although a charitable trust must have |certainty of intention| (just the same as a |private express trust|), |certainty of object| is *not* required.
@The |rule against perpetuity| and inalienability of land does *not* apply.
@@I.e., by contrast with the 125-year maximum lifetime of a private express trust, a charity can continue indefinitely.
/ {<Virgo cites King's Canterbury as the oldest charity, saying it was founded 1500 years ago. In doing so he makes himself a trustee of their marketing puff. It would be more correct to say that in 586 (about _14_ hundred years ago), an abbey was founded at which there was _some teaching_, explicit evidence for which is not found before the C9th.>}
@Although the maximum number of trustees for a trust of land is ordinarily _four_  (&g&S34 Trustee Act 1925&g&), no such limit is imposed on a charitable trust holding land.
@Although the trustees of PETs must in general act *unanimously*, only a *bare majority* is needed for a CT. the requirement is only majority.
@The |Cy-près Doctrine|. Once given to a charity, then should it fold, or be unable to fulfil its obligation for some other reason, then the funds _may_ not _result back_ to the settlor(s)/testator(s), but instead be transferred by the courts to another charity.
SUMMARY *Financial Advantages*
@Exemption from _many_ forms of taxation, e.g., capital gains tax -- but not _automatic_ exemption from local business rates.
@Can reclaim tax from the IR.
@In the '60s, Gift Aid was a useful way of avoiding income tax. A salary of £100K, after tax, would be more like £40K. But if you gave £60K to charity on condition they'd *give the majority back* (a tax-exempt transfer), the treasury would far less.
SUMMARY *Reputational Advantages*
@Reputation, which, for instance, can make it easier to raise funds. |Independent Schools Council v Charity Commission|.

SUMMARY ~*Disadvantages*~
@The quid pro quo for the above is *particularly burdensome administrative obligations*.
@Part 8 of the |Charities Act 2011| imposes strict duties on trustees of charities to prepare accounts, prepare for audit, and report to the Charity Commission; failure in such regards carries criminal penalties.

SUMMARY ~*Current*~
/_Section_ -- 
+ of the |Charities Act 2006| provides the first blackletter definition of _charity_. S1 of the 2011 Act is identical. They provide that a charity: 
@@is an institution (a) established *for charitable purposes only* and (b) submitting to the jurisdiction of the High Court.
+ defines *charitable purpose* by means of a long but non-exhaustive list. 
@@The 2011 Act is (functionally) identical, but, for the sake of clarity, shifts the list of purposes at S2(2) of the 2006 Act to a dedicated section, S3(1).
@@Whether something is one of the |Charitable Purposes| is the meat of this subject.
+of the 2006 Act (and S4 of the 2011 Act) define the |Public Benefit| requirement.

SUMMARY ~*Public Benefit*~
@S3(2) of the 2006 Act (and S4(2) of the 2011 Act) provides that public benefit is *no longer presumed*. It must be instead be proven that it was both *established for*, and that it *continues to exist for*, public benefit. 
@@As well as being a prong in the 2006 Act's obvious attack on Public Schools, this has the added feature of making life a little harder for the alarmingly large number of fronts for terrorist groups like Hizb-Allah or Hamas there were, at the time, masquerading as charities.
@Public benefit.

@@@Is it spread *widely enough* to be *public*?
@@It must therefore be established by the facts of each case, by reference to the (very) many cases.

SUMMARY Listed at *S3(1)* of the |2011 act|, Blackstone's _Property Law 2015-16_ *p. 381* (and S2(2) of the |2006 Act|).
/They partly codify the existing law, and partly stake out a sensible boundary to the field of play.  The order in the statute correlates roughly with their importance and susceptibility to contention. Those, in turn, correlate with the number of cases to remember for each.

TYPE Concept 
CATEGORY Charities; Charitable Purposes
SUMMARY *S3(1)(a)* of 2011 Act. Blackstone's _Property Law 2015-16_ -- *p. 381*
/N.B., 'prevention' to the common law understanding by the 2006 Act. 
SUMMARY ~*Poverty*~
/ *Is* --
@*Relative*. |Re Clark| 1923.
@Not as bad as *destitution*, but is _going short in ordinary circumstances_. |Re Coulthurst's Will Trust| 1951.
@The condition of people in _genuinely straitened circumstances_, unable to maintain a modest standard of living for themselves and their dependents. |Mary Clark Homes Trustees v Anderson| 1904.
% *The working classes* --

@Distressed gentlefolk. |Re Young|

@Unsuccessful literary men (!) |Thompson v Thompson|.
% *But not* --
@ Boys in need of _knickers_. Yes, _knickers_. |Re Gwyon|, which failed to discriminate in favour of _poor_ boys.

SUMMARY ~*Relief*~
@It _isn't_ enough that the gift should be for the poor. It should _also_ be for the poor *for relief of their poverty*. |IRC v Baddeley| 1955.
@It ought not be for beer, circuses or iPhones, but *essentials*. |Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust v AG| [1983]
SUMMARY ~*Prevention*~
@Discussed in |AITC Foundation's Application for Registration of Charity| [2006] -- the case of a charity primarily for those who suffered financial losses as result of unwise investment -- so who may not have been that poor.
SUMMARY ~*Waffle*~
/ What is the irreducible minimum for a decent life? How do the slums of Manchester measure up to the layouts of Mumbai? Can a child living in a household with only 60% of the UK average income really be said to be living in poverty -- or does that definition do no more than reveal its authors' acceptance of that least-frequently justified lemma of modern life -- that _inequality per se Is A Bad Thing_?

SUMMARY ~*Education*~
/*Can be* --
@Not just the narrow sense of classroom teaching; also the education of artistic taste. |Royal Choir Society v IRC| [1943]
@The improvement of '_any_ useful branch of knowledge'. |Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales v AG| 1973.
@An annual chess tournament for the boys of Portsmouth, but only just. |Re Dupree's Deed Trust| 1945. Sudoku? Pin the Tail on the Donkey? 
@A rose garden. In Australia, at any rate, such a thing is 'conducive of education for everyone but the most blasé of students'. |McGrath v Cohen|. 
@Providing _treats_ or _field days_ for school children. |Re Melody|.
@Or giving the little brats elephant rides -- Re Lopes [1931]. Presumably to teach them about the exploitation of animals.
% *Cannot be* --
@A college to training _spiritualistic mediums_. |Re Hummeltenberg| 1923.
@A school for _pickpockets or prostitutes_. Obiter in |Re Pinion|, although some sources this as obiter in |Re Shaw|.
@Political causes masquerading as education. Even ostensibly worthy ones, such as disarmament. |Southwood v AG| 2000.
SUMMARY ~*Research*~

% *May* be --
@Abstruse, but still be useful, nonetheless. |Re Hopkin's Will Trust| -- whether Shakespeare's plays written by a bloke called _Bacon_ or a bloke called _Shakespeare_.
SUMMARY ~*Public Schools*~
/Here is your big fat opportunity to show how much or how little of a nauseating little Marxist you are by slagging off, or indeed sticking up for, public schools. Show how clued up you are by remarking that 30% of boys at Eton are on some form of scholarship; but be sure to follow up such a concession with statements to the effect that the other 70% should be strung up by their over-privileged _balls_ from the nearest quadrangle, for having had the sheer bloody-minded _gall_ not to have killed themselves in disgust at their unmerited status.
/->-Not all such schools are charities, however -- some are run for profit. Note that since the 2006 Act, Public Schools have been *required to offer financial assistance*.



NAME Advancement of Religion
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Charities; Charitable Purposes
SUMMARY *S3(1)(c)* |Charities Act 2011|
/Blackstone's _Property Law 2015-16_ -- *p382*
SUMMARY ~*Definition*~
@There was no _statutory_ definition, but in |Re South Place Ethical Society| [1980], a religion was held to comprise:
++Belief in something *supernatural*, and
++Faith in, and worship of, the aforesaid. 
@So Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, all OK, as are the Moonies -- but not the Theosophical Society. Buddhists don't really believe in god, though. Perhaps a judge in the High Court in 1980 would have known this; perhaps not.
@Scientology, however, lacks *worship*.
@@Denning, in 1972, called it downright *dangerous* for its use of whacko psychiatric techniques. |Hubbard v Vosper|. {At this juncture, Margaret Carran asked if there were any scientologists present. And fuck me, someone put their hand up.}
@@In New South Wales, it's been held to be a religion. |Church of New Faith v Commissioners for Payroll Tax|.
@@In 2014, it was held that (for the purposes of marriage) scientology "chapels" are places of religious worship, so marriages can be conducted in them. |Re (exp Hodkin) v Registrar|.

SUMMARY ~*Atheism*~
/A common exam question: is atheism a religion charity?
@However tempting it may be, don't answer like this: 'Of course it fucking well isn't. Atheism is not a system of belief. It's merely the laudably unobjectionable position of *refusing to accept something on bad evidence'*. 

SUMMARY *~Current Position~ -- S3(2)(c) of the 2011 Act and Charity Commission Guidance*
@Religion may involve a belief in one or more gods,
@@or none at all (_not_ itself an attempt to cover Buddhism).
@So what about the silly people who put "Jedi" on the census form? That, after all, is just as made up as all other religions.
@In |Gnostic Centre| 2009, the Charity Commission listed these four conditions:
+Belief in a god/supreme being/divine/plural/transcendental being/*spiritual* principle
+Worship -- relationship between believer and entity
+Degree of cogency, cohesion, seriousness or importance.
@@N.B. this is the Charity Commission's doing, it is not a principle appearing in the case law or statute.
+Identifiable *positive, beneficial, moral and ethical* framework.
@@So what about the three "great" monotheisms, all of which, for the better part of their histories condoned slavery, one of which still obviously does, and each of which, to greater or lesser degrees, gives rise, explicitly because their teachings, to catalogue upon catalogue of the most acutely objectionable moral and ethical behaviour?
@@*Druidism* is a valid religion on these grounds.


SUMMARY ~*What is Advancement?*~ 
@It's: *promoting* it, *spreading its message* even wider among mankind, *taking positive steps to sustain and increase* ... pastoral... missionary... zzzzz.. |United Grand Lodge of Masons v Holborn BC|.



NAME Political Purpose of a Charity
CATEGORY Charities; Invalid Charitable Purposes
TYPE Concept
SUMMARY It's a political purpose if it it advocates change in the law, or, arguably, maintenance of the status quo. The reasons for this ancient rule were set out nicely by Slade J in |McGovern v AG| [1982], in terms of the effect it would have on the courts. 
/The courts:
@Lack adequate means of judging whether the proposed change of such a purpose would be for public benefit.
@Would trespass, were they to try, on the role of legislature...
@...and would jeopardise their reputation for political impartiality.
@And also risk prejudicing the relations with foreign countries. 
/{CHECK -- as it makes bugger-all sense.}
SUMMARY ~*Cases*~
@Something *requiring a change in the law* is a political purpose. |National Anti-Vivisection Society v IRC| 1948.
@So is *disarmament* . |Southwood v AG| 2000.
@And 'dissemination of *socialist medicine*' {yes, you read that right}. |Re Bushnell| [1975]
@Funnily enough, a gift to a political party is political. |Bonar Law Memorial Trust v IRC| (1933)
@As is a gift to a campaign against the abolition of free milk in schools. |Baldry v Feintuck|.

NAME The Cy-près Doctrine
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Charities
SUMMARY *Ss.61-67* of the 2011 Act. Blackstone's _Property Law 2015-16_, *from p. 388*
SUMMARY When a validly-charitable trust complying with all |three conditions| fails, its property may be 'applied cy-près.' Rather than result back to its settlors and testators, their wishes will be respected 'aus*si près* que possible'.

SUMMARY *S61* gives trustees the duty to apply trust property cy-près when it _could_ or _must_ be applied cy-près. 

SUMMARY ~*Failure of Gift*~
/This can be *initial failure* where the charity closes _before_ the property vests, or *subsequent failure* where it does so _afterwards_. In the second case, cy-près is applied automatically. In the first, it applies only if a *paramount charitable intention* be shown of the testator/settlor.
SUMMARY *Initial Failure*
/_T makes a will on 1st Feb '17 leaving £10K to charity C... which closes on the 28th Feb. T then dies on the 1st March, turning his will into a public document._
SUMMARY If a *paramount charitable intention* can be shown, cy-près will apply. 
/It will apply when:
@Purpose mattered more than institution, especially if the institution didn't even exist. |Re Harwood| 1936.
@A condition attached to a gift would render it invalid. |Re Lysaght|.
@Where its context manifests a general charitable intention -- e.g., if it's one charitable gift amongst many. |Re Satterthwaite's WT|.

SUMMARY *Subsequent Failure*
