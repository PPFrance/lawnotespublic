<p><b>Module Aims and Learning Outcomes</b></p>

<h1 align="left" > </h1>

<h1 align="left" >Aims</h1>

<p>¨ To give students an understanding of the fundamental principles of Equity as a system of law and its relationship with the Common Law</p>

<p>¨ To demonstrate the relevance of Equity in a modern context</p>

<p>¨ To familiarize students with one of Equity’s most important inventions – the Trust – in its different manifestations</p>

<p>¨ To provide a platform from which students can go on to study more specialised areas which depend on a knowledge and understanding of the workings of Equity</p>

<h2>Learning outcomes:</h2>

<p>¨ As the subject contains some very technical language students should familiarize themselves with such language very early on the course via successful completion of a key concepts test.</p>

<p>¨ Students should demonstrate knowledge and understanding at a sound basic level of the well-established principles in areas covered by the syllabus. In particular, students should demonstrate, both in oral and written format, understanding of the concept of the trust and its relevance not only in the field of deliberately-created institutional relationship, but also to circumstances where Equity has acted to provide a remedy.</p>

<p>¨ Students should demonstrate the ability to apply the relevant legal principles to problems in tutorials.</p>

<p>¨ Students should demonstrate the ability to critically assess the effectiveness of the law with particular emphasis on law reform via statute or judicial development.</p>

<p>¨ Students should be able to demonstrate in each tutorial that, as well as having an understanding of the relevant subject matter, they have read and can summarise the additional compulsory reading.</p>

<p>¨ Students should be able to handle the relevant statutory sources and demonstrate an understanding of their relationship to Equity.</p>

<p>¨ Each student will be required to contribute to discussions in tutorials and should be able to articulate an opinion as to the role and function of Equity in the relevant area.</p>

<p>¨ Students should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the correlation between performance throughout the year and examination performance.</p>

<p>By the end of the course all students should</p>

<p>**** be equipped with a critical and thorough understanding of the trust concept</p>

<p>**** understand the nature of, and the difference between, proprietary and personal rights and the impact and operation of the rules and doctrines of Equity</p>

<p>**** be able to analyse complex legal problems objectively and apply the appropriate rules to their solution</p>

<p><b>Teaching arrangements</b></p>

<p>The teaching will consist of lectures and tutorial discussion but the focus will be uponproblem solving within the field of this subject. Students will be expected to demonstrate both knowledge and understanding based on prepared reading and, also, oral analytical skills. Powerpoint slides will be made available for each lecture and will refer to the key cases; the additional lecture materials in this handout are for students’ guidance as to the scope of each area of law covered, and so contain references to some additional cases which there will not be time to cover in the lectures. As you complete the reading for each class, check that you have made notes on the cases listed in the relevant part of this handout.</p>

<p>Students should always read the relevant textbook chapter or directed reading before the class, as part of their preparation. This and other handouts will recommend further reading for all the areas covered on the course. Further materials will be provided on Moodle as the course progresses.</p>

<p>Active participation in the course is essential.</p>

<p><b>1. INTRODUCTION TO EQUITY</b></p>

<p>1. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>**** Common Law and Equity</p>

<p>** Aristotle’s “Ethics” – “<i>For Equity, though superior to justice, is still just … justice and equity coincide, and although both are good, equity is superior. What causes the difficulty is the fact that equity is just, but not what is legally just: it is rectification of legal justice”. </i></p>

<p>**** Earl of Oxford’s Case 1615</p>

<p>** <i>“The office of the Chancellor is to correct men’s consciences for frauds,</i> <i>breach of trusts, wrongs and oppression… and to soften and mollify the extremity of the law</i>”. </p>

<p>**** Common Law Procedure Act 1852</p>

<p>**** Chancery Amendment Act 1858</p>

<p>**** Judicature Acts 1873-75 </p>

<p>**** Supreme Court Act 1981 – for full text of the Act see: www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1981/pdf/ukpga_19810054_en.pdf</p>

<p>A Brief History of Equity</p>

<p>As a broad but imperfect definition equity could be said to be the branch of law which was, before the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875, administered in the Court of Chancery. </p>

<p><b>History </b></p>

<h2 align="left">Students interested in philosophical approaches to Equity should read Feldman “Equity in History” – <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/clppt/program2002/readings/feldman/rtf">www.law.nyu.edu/clppt/program2002/readings/feldman/rtf</a></h2>

<h2>1066: </h2>

<p>The conquest of William I. He confiscated all land from all landowners and allowed it to be held again by them but only in return for services or money. Since then all lands are held by the Crown. </p>

<h2>~1230: </h2>

<p>Emergence of the device of use. </p>

<p>Equity came into existence as early as 1238 when Henry III dispensed with baronial chancellors who held office for life and took the office into his own hands. </p>

<h2>1535: Statute of Uses</h2>

<p>This statute brought about a sudden decrease in the influence of the Court of Chancery by abolishing its main form of business, namely the use. </p>

<p><b>1238 to around 1620</b></p>

<p>The decisions of the Chancellor in this period were characterised by flexibility whereby remedies would vary from case to case. This period was also known as a battle between Equity and Common law.</p>

<p><b>1615: </b></p>

<p><b>Earl’s of Oxford Case – victory of Equity over Common Law. </b></p>

<p><a href="http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/367/367images/egerton.jpg"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Edward_coke.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Sir Edward Coke Thomas Egerton = </p>

<p>representing Lord Ellesmere </p>

<p>Common Law Equity </p>

<p><b><i>“It’s the function of the judge not to “The cause why there is Chancery</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>make law but to declare the law, is, for that men’s actions are so divers</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>according to the mete –wand of the law and infinite that it is impossible to </i></b></p>

<p><b><i>and not by the crooked cord of discretion make any general law which may </i></b></p>

<p><b><i> aptly meet with every particular act </i></b></p>

<p>and not fail in some circumstances.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b></b></p>

<h2>1676: <i>Cook v Fountain</i> 3 Swan 585</h2>

<p>Lord Nottingham expressed a new harder and more rules based character of Equity – “the conscience by which I can proceed is merely <i>civilis et politica</i>, and tied to certain measures.” Length of the Chancellor’s foot began to be replaced by substantive body of equitable rules and principles. </p>

<h4>Reasons for changes in nature of Equity post 1617</h4>

<p>Criticism of the variability of the Chancellors’ decisions on one side and on the other the Chancellor was overloaded with petitions: rules and principles allow for the cases to be decided quicker. </p>

<p>In 17<sup>th</sup> century reporting of cases commenced. </p>

<p><b>1617 to 1873 </b></p>

<p>Equity grew both in size and substance. The 18<sup>th</sup> Century saw the development of many modern equitable principles. Principles and rules rather than Chancellor’s conscience led to inflexibility: <i>rigor aequitatis</i>. </p>

<p><b>1873 and 1875 – Judicature Acts </b></p>

<h4> </h4>

<h4><i>Query: Fusion of the two systems?</i></h4>

<p>Although the systems have fused the question remains whether the laws themselves fused. S. 25(11) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 provided that in the event of conflict between the rules of law and equity, that the rules of equity shall prevail.</p>

<p>Ashburner’s famous fluvial metaphor: “The two streams of jurisdiction, though they run in the same channel; run side by side, and do not mingle their waters.” </p>

<p>For an Australian take on the issue see Conference Paper: Fusion: Fallacy, Future or Finished, Keith Mason, Fusion Conference, 16 December 2004 – <a href="http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink">www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink</a> </p>

<p>The Current Position</p>

<p><i>Key features of Equity:</i></p>

<p>The characteristics of Equity are described in maxims, e.g.:</p>

<p>**** Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy </p>

<p>**** Equity follows the law<i>.</i> </p>

<p>Having said that: </p>

<p>**** Equity corrects the law where the law is unjust </p>

<p>**** When the equities are equal, the first in time prevails </p>

<p>**** When the equities are equal, the law prevails </p>

<p>**** He who seeks equity must do equity </p>

<p>**** He who comes to equity must come with clean hands </p>

<p>**** Equity assists the diligent not the tardy </p>

<p>**** Equity is equality </p>

<p>**** Equity looks to the intent, rather than to the form </p>

<p>**** Equity looks on that as done which ought to be done</p>

<p>**** Equity imputes an intention to fulfill an obligation;</p>

<p>**** Equity acts <i>in personam</i>.</p>

</ol> <p><b>KEY CONCEPTS IN TRUST LAW: for private study- there will be an informal test on these vital concepts and terms, so please do study them, and ask if you need clarification!</b></p>

<p><b>The Trust</b></p>

<p>Ownership in property can be divided into a number of different compartments. A trust is where one or more parties hold and can deal with the legal title of property on behalf of somebody else. The legal title is sometimes called the paper title because the actual benefit of the property belongs to whoever the trustee is holding the legal title for. Typical examples used to be family trusts, but trusts are prevalent nowadays for things such as pension funds and charities. A trustee can, therefore, not usually have any real interest in the property although in certain circumstances a trustee may also be a beneficiary.</p>

<p>Underhill’s definition of trusts – “A trust is equitable obligation, binding a person (who is called a trustee) to deal with property over which he has control (which is called the trust property) either for the benefit of persons (who are called the beneficiaries or <i>cestui que trust</i>) of whom he himself may be one, and any of whom may enforce the obligation or for a charitable purpose which may be enforced at the instance of the Attorney – General, or for some other purpose permitted by law though unenforceable”. </p>

<p><b>Beneficiary (sometimes called cestui que trust) - </b>The beneficiary owns the actual value of the property and in most, but not all, cases can control the actions of the trustee.</p>

<p><b>Fiduciary - </b>A fiduciary relationship is one where one person reposes trust and confidence in another for that other to manage his/her affairs. The classic example of a fiduciary relationship is that between a trustee and a beneficiary, but there are also other fiduciary relationships for example, between company directors and companies, between partner and partners and principal and agents.</p>

<p>Because of the nature of trust and confidence in the fiduciary relationship the courts control fiduciaries very strictly.</p>

<p><b>Objects of a trust - </b>This expression is very often used interchangeably with beneficiaries.</p>

<p><b>Legal and beneficial ownership - </b>A trustee is said to hold the legal ownership of property, but the beneficial/equitable/proprietary interest is held by the beneficiaries. </p>

<p><b>Different types of trust</b></p>

<ol start="1" type="1"> <li>A wishes to make a provision for his underage children whom by law are incapable of holding property for themselves. He asks T (a trustee) to hold the property on trust for his children. This is <b>an express trust</b>.</li>
<li>A and B purchase a house in joint names. A and B contribute equally to the purchase money of the house. The house is conveyed solely into A’s name. There is no express trust because s53 (1)(b) of the Law and Property Act 1925 stipulates that trusts of land have to be evidenced in writing. In this case the presumed intention of A and B is that they share the house equally, otherwise they would not have contributed equally to the purchase price. In this case B’s beneficial ownership results back to B. This is called a <b>resulting trust</b>. Note here, that A is both trustee and a beneficiary because he/she holds the house on trust as trustee in equal shares for A and B.</li>
</ol> <ol start="3" type="1"> <li>A asks B to hold a house on trust for C, but again does not comply with the prescribed statutory formalities. In the absence of the evidentiary formal requirements B fraudulently purports to claim the house for himself and not for C. The courts will not permit statutory formalities to be used as an instrument for fraud and will defeat B’s fraudulent intention by imposing a<b> constructive trust</b> on B ensuring that the actual/beneficial ownership of the house is held for C.</li>
</ol><p><b>Conveyance</b> - The formal transfer of property, a term usually used in connection with land. </p>

<p><b>A charitable trust</b> - A trust which is used to control property for purposes which the law defines as charitable in nature.</p>

<p><b>Attorney-General - </b>In the equity and trusts sense, the person designated to control charitable trusts.</p>

<p><b>Disposition - </b>A transfer of property.</p>

<p><b>Assignment - </b>Also a transfer of property, but usually of intangible property.</p>

<p><b>Testamentary disposition - </b>Property left by a will.</p>

<p><b>Bequest - </b>Personal property left by will.</p>

<p><b>Devise - </b>Land left by will.</p>

<p><b>Testamentary trust - </b>Trust created by a deceased person.</p>

<p><b>Executor/executrix - </b>Male or female person named in a will in whom the legal title is vested until the property under the will is distributed either by way of trust or by way of outright gift.</p>

<p><b>Administrator/administratrix - </b>Where a person does not name anyone in the will an administrator/administratrix fulfills the same function as an executor/executrix.</p>

<p><b>Intestate succession</b> - Where a person does not leave a will and the disposition of their property is administered under the Inheritance, (Provision for Family &amp; Dependants) Act 1975.</p>

<p><b>Statutory formalities</b> - There are a number of statutory formalities which govern trust law. </p>

<p><b>Donee - </b>The recipient of a gift.</p>

<p><b>Inter vivos trust - </b>A trust created by a living person, usually called the settlor.</p>

<p><b>Common law actions - </b>These are actions of right so that once a breach of a common law right has been established you are automatically entitled to relief from the courts. These are often called rights <i>in personam</i>, that is they are personal rights, usually comprising of a right to sue so that they rank in terms of priority with general creditors in terms of insolvency.</p>

<p><b>Insolvency - </b>A bankrupt person can be sued by general creditors with a priority given to secured creditors, but if somebody can establish a proprietary right that right will prevail before all other creditors.</p>

<p><b>Proprietary right - </b>If one can establish a proprietary right, which beneficiaries under a trust can usually do, they will recover whatever is left of their property in insolvency thus having priority over all other creditors. These are rights <i>in rem</i>.</p>

<p><b>Real property</b> - Consists of land.</p>

<p><b>Personal property</b> - Anything other than land.</p>

<p><b>Tangible property - </b>Physical property.</p>

<p><b>Intangible property - </b>Non physical property.</p>

<p><b>Chose in action - </b>Again intangible property such as the ownership of a right to sue.</p>

<p><b>Sui juris - </b>Of full legal age and mental capacity.</p>

<p><b>Covenants - </b>Common law contracts which are legally binding because, in the absence of consideration, they comply with the formalities prescribed by the Law of property (Miscellaneous Provisions Act) 1989. Only binding at common law and not in equity.</p>

<p><b>Equitable remedies - </b>Unlike common law actions, they are discretionary in nature. See the maxim Equity will not assist a volunteer. It means that the equitable remedy of specific performance will not be given for a breach of a common law contract. </p>

<p><b>Volunteer - </b>Someone who has not provided consideration for a contract.</p>

<p><b>Specific performance - </b>An order of the Court of Equity to compel performance of a contract where there has been consideration given and the subject matter of the contract is unique goods, i.e. cannot be replaced in the market for example shares in a private company. <i>Patel v Ali</i> [1984] 1 All ER 978.</p>

<p><b>Pacta sunt servanda - </b>Latin for the fact that agreements should be upheld.</p>

<p><b>Nemo dat quod non habet - </b>Latin for the fact that no man can obtain a better legal title (exception money). For example if a thief steals my jewelry and sells it on to an unsuspecting third party. The thief has not got any legal title and so neither can the third party, the legal title remains with me.</p>

<p><b>Equity’s darling - </b>The bona fide purchaser for value of a legal estate without notice.</p>

<p><b>Bona vacantia - </b>Ownerless property which usually reverts to The Crown by way of the Treasury.</p>

<p><b>Life and remainder interests - </b>Really means the division between a capital asset and income derived therefrom. For example, A leave shares in X company to Alice for life and thereafter to Bob means that Alice gets the dividends on the shares during her lifetime then the capital value of the shares goes to Bob on her death.</p>

<p><b>Estoppel - </b>Where a person is stopped from going back on a promise or representation on which another has relied in the absence of formalities supporting the promise or representation and where it would be inequitable to do be allowed to resile on the promise or representation.</p>

<p><b>Inequitable - </b>Contrary to the established equitable jurisdiction.</p>

<p><b>Unconscionability and unconscionable conduct - </b>Something which shocks the conscience of the Court of Equity according to the established equitable jurisdiction.</p>

<p><b>Equitable maxims - </b>See the induction documentation, but for two examples,</p>

<p>Equity looks on that as done which ought to be done; <i>Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid</i> [1993] 3 WLR 1143</p>

<p>He who comes to equity must come with clean hands; <i>Tinsley v Milligan</i> [1998] 3 WLR 126</p>

<p><b>Proceeds of sale - </b>If A leaves three houses by will on trust for two people the trustee/s will have to sell the three houses and divide the proceeds of sale between the two beneficiaries.</p>

<p><b>Common law wife - </b>A misnomer - there is no such legal identity</p>

<p><b>Perpetuity</b> - A period of time on which for policy reasons the law will not allow property to be outside the general circulation of the economy</p>

<p><b>Blackacre / Whiteacre</b> - Academic terminology to denote land/real property</p>

<p><b>Residuary Estate</b> - Any property which remains undisposed of after a number of specific gifts on death. </p>

<p><b>2. THE EXPRESS TRUST AND THE THREE CERTAINTIES </b></p>

<p>For a valid express private trust, the three certainties of intention, subject matter and objects must be satisfied:</p>

<p>***Wright v Atkyns(1823) Turn. &amp; R, 143, 157 – per Lord Eldon “<i>first … the word must be imperative …; secondly … the subject must be certain …; and thirdly … the object must be as certain as the subject.” </i></p>

<p>***Knight v Knight (1840) 3 Beav. 148, 173 - </p>

<p>Certainty of intention</p>

<p>**** The requisite level of obligation – the settlor must have intended to impose a legal obligation on the trustee as opposed to a mere moral obligation. It must also be clear that he intended to create a trust and not anything else e.g. loan or a gift. </p>

<p>***Lambe v Eames (1871) LR 6 Ch. 597</p>

<p>***Re Adams &amp; the Kensington Vestry (1884) 27 Ch D 394</p>

<p>**** Law or construction?</p>

<p>*** <i>Re Steele's Will Trust</i> [1948] Ch  603</p>

<p>**** The word “trust” does not have to be used and its use does not guarantee creation of trust. The key is the true intention of the settlor which can be demonstrated in various ways. </p>

<p>***Comiskey v Bowring-Hanbury [1905] AC 84</p>

<p>***Re Kayford [1975] 1 WLR 279</p>

<p>***Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567</p>

<p>*** Twinsectra v Yardley [2002] 2 WLR 802 - Lord Millett said: “[<i>I] hold the Quistclose trust to be an entirely orthodox example of the kind of default trust known as a resulting trust. The lender pays the money to the borrower by way of loan, but he does not part with the entire beneficial interest in the money, and insofar as he does not it is held on a resulting trust for the lender from the outset. Contrary to the opinion of the Court of Appeal, it is the borrower who has a very limited use of the money, being obliged to apply it for the stated purpose or return it. He has no beneficial interest in the money, which remains throughout in the lender, subject only to the borrower’s power or duty to apply the money in accordance with the lender’s instructions. When the purpose fails, the money is returnable to the lender, not under some new trust in his favour which only comes into being on the failure of the purpose, but because the resulting trust in his favour is no longer subject to any power on the part of the borrower to make use of the money. Whether the borrower is obliged to apply the money for the stated purpose or merely at liberty to do so, and whether the lender can countermand the borrower’s mandate while it is still capable of being carried out, must depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.” </i></p>

<p>***<i>Re Challoner Club Ltd (In Liquidation)</i> (1997) The Times 4 November.</p>

<p>**** Lack of certainty of intention equals absolute gift. </p>

<h2>Certainty of subject matter</h2>

<p><b>3. THE EXPRESS TRUST AND FORMALITIES </b></p>

<h2>Basic problem</h2>

<p>Trusts created by will</p>

<p>**** S.9 Will Act 1837 as amended by the Administration of Justice Act 1982 provides that a will must be in writing signed by the testator or person under his direction and witnessed by two people. </p>

<p>**** Trust contained in a will is bound to fail, regardless of the law of trusts, if the will is void. </p>

<p>**** Note the exception of secret trusts discussed later. </p>

<p>Trusts created <i>inter vivos</i></p>

<p>**** Trusts of pure personalty require no further formalities.</p>

<p>**** Trusts of land – this type of trust is defined by s.1 of Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 as “trust which consists of and includes land”. Therefore it is possible for trust of land to contain personalty as well. </p>

<p>** s53 (1)(b) LPA 1925: “a declaration of trust respecting any land or any interest therein must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person who is able to declare such trust or by his will”. But note: </p>

<p>**** (1) the sanction for non-compliance: the trust is unenforceable</p>

<p>**** but not void. </p>

<p>**** (2) the section applies to express trusts only – s.53(1)b</p>

<p>**** (3) equity will not permit a statute to be used as an instrument of fraud</p>

<p>- <i>Rochefoucald v Boustead</i> [1897] 1 Ch. 196)</p>

<p>**** Trusts and other dispositions of existing equitable interests</p>

<p>** s53 (1)(c): “a disposition of an equitable interest or trust subsisting at the time of the disposition must be in writing, signed by the person disposing of the same, or by his agent there into lawfully authorised in writing or by will”.</p>

<p>** s53 (2): the section does not “affect the creation or operation of resulting, implied or constructive trusts”.</p>

He may, of course, do this by actually transferring the property to the persons for who he intends to provide, and the provision will then be effectual and it will be equally effectual if he transfers the property to a trustee for the purposes of the settlement, or declared that he himself holds it in trust for those purposes … but in order to render the settlement binding, one or other of these modes must, as I understand the law of this court, to be resorted to, for there is no equity in this court to perfect and imperfect gift</i>”. </p>

<p><b>5. NON CHARITABLE PURPOSE TRUSTS AND BENEFICIARY PRINCIPLE </b></p>

<p>The rule against remoteness is not really relevant but the rule against inalienability is. The rule against inalienability dictates that non-charitable purpose trusts cannot run on for a period longer than that prescribed by law.</p>

<p>The rule is that if, when viewed from the date on which the trust was created, there is any possibility of the trust continuing for longer than a life or lives in being plus twenty-one years, the trust is wholly void.</p>

<p>An example of lives in being is what is known as a “Royal Lives Clause”. At the moment, the Royal Lives Clause normally used refers to the descendants of King George VI (the father of the present Queen). The lives in being are all the descendants of that King alive at the moment when the trust is created. The perpetuity period ends 21 years after the death of the last of those descendants.</p>

<p>If there are no relevant or stipulated lives in being, the period is 21 years.</p>

<p>Provided that the trust can last no longer than the appropriate perpetuity period in that it must either necessarily end earlier or is limited to end at the end of the perpetuity period by the use of some expression such as “for such period as the law allows”, the non-charitable purpose trust in question will necessarily comply with the rule against inalienability.</p>

<p>Traditional beneficiary principle </p>

<p>Morice v Bishop of Durham (1804) 9 Ves.399 – “<i>There can be no trust, over the exercise of which this court will not assume control … If there be clear trust, but for uncertain objects, the property … is undisposed of… Every trust must have a definite object. There must be somebody in whose favour the court can decree performance</i>” – per Lord Grant M.R.</p>

Yet if any beneficiary was an infant, or an unborn or unascertained person, it was held that the court had no general inherent or other jurisdiction to concur in any such arrangement on behalf of that beneficiary</i>”. </p>

Whether it would be better that some authority should now say those cases were wrong, this is perhaps not the moment to consider. At any rate I cannot think of this kind, the case of providing outside a church an unspecified and unidentified memorial, is the kind of instance which should be allowed to add to those troublesome anomalous and aberrant cases.</i>” </p>

<p><b>6a. AN INTRODUCTION TO CONSTRUCTIVE TRUSTS</b></p>

<p>Students should read this section before the first lecture on secret trusts. </p>

<p>Constructive trusts arise by operation of law. Unlike all other trusts, a constructive trust is imposed by the court as a result of the conduct of the trustee and therefore arises independently of the intention of any of the parties. Constructive trusts therefore form a residual category of trusts incapable of precise definition. </p>

<p>**** Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Herbert Smith (No.2) [1969] 2 Ch. 276, 300: “<i>English law provides no clear and all‑embracing definition of a constructive trust. Its boundaries have been left perhaps deliberately vague, so as not to restrict the court by technicalities in deciding what the justice of a particular case may demand</i>.”</p>

<p>**** Muschinski v Dodds (1985) 62 ALR (High Court of Australia): “<i>a remedial institution which equity imposes regardless of actua1 or presumed agreement or intention (and subsequently protects) to preclude the retention or assertion of beneficial ownership to property to the extent that such retention or assertion would be contrary to equitable principle</i>”.</p>

<p>It is generally accepted that three situations give rise to the imposition of a constructive trust: first, where advantages have been obtained by fraudulent or unconscionable conduct; secondly, where advantages have been obtained by fiduciaries breaching their duty of loyalty; and, thirdly, where strangers have intermeddled with property subject to a trust. The classification of certain other types of trust, which are relevant for other parts of the syllabus, is more controversial: these are secret trusts, the trusts which arise as a result of the creation of a contract of sale which is specifically enforceable (see <i>Neville v Wilson</i> on formalities) and constructive trusts in order to give effect in equity to transfers of property which are at law incomplete.</p>

<p>The common feature of all these situations in which constructive trusts are imposed is that their imposition potentially produces liabilities both of a proprietary and of a personal nature for the constructive trustee. Reliance on the proprietary remedy will entitle the beneficiary to recover the appropriate interest in the property together with any income or other fruits which the property has produced since the moment at which the constructive trust took effect (normally, but not always, the moment when the constructive trustee was guilty of the misconduct which gave rise to the imposition of a constructive trust). Reliance on the personal liability of the constructive trustee to account will entitle the beneficiary to recover the value of the appropriate interest at the moment at which the constructive trust took effect together with interest thereon. Where the constructive trustee is solvent, the election between these two remedies will not normally be particularly significant. However, where the constructive trustee is insolvent, reliance on the proprietary remedy, but not on the personal remedy, will give the beneficiary priority over the general creditors. Thus, the imposition of a constructive trust upon a person who is, or subsequently becomes, bankrupt will almost inevitably prejudice the interests of his general creditors.</p>

<p><b>6b. SECRET TRUSTS </b></p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>**** The perambulatory nature of testamentary decisions!</p>

<p>**** A secret trust arises when an intending settlor makes a gift of property in his will or leaves an existing will unrevoked or dies intestate on the strength of an undertaking by the person entitled under his will or intestacy to hold whatever property he receives on trust for a third party. In such circumstances the court will enforce performance of the undertaking at the suit of the third party. </p>

<p>**** There are two types of secret trusts: </p>

<p>** <b>fully secret trusts</b> – a trust is fully secret when both the existence of the trust and its terms are concealed; such a trust therefore arises where the property which is the subject of the trust is, on the face of the will, left to the recipient absolutely or where the settlor died intestate. </p>

<p>** <b>half secret trusts</b> – a trust is half secret when the existence of a trust is revealed but its terms are concealed; such a trust therefore arises where the property which is the subject matter of the trust is, on the face of the will, left to the recipient as a trustee.</p>

<p>**** The existence of secret trusts is, on the face of things, directly contrary to Wills Act 1837 s.9, which requires wills to be in writing signed by the testator, or some other person in his presence and by his direction, in the presence of two witnesses both present at the same time, who also sign. Therefore they exist as an exception to the normal rule. </p>

<h1>The Basic Prerequisites for ALL Secret Trusts</h1>

<h2>**** An intention by the testator to create a trust</h2>

<h2>**** The communication of the trust to the intended trustee OUTSIDE OF THE WILL</h2>

<h2>**** Acceptance of the trust by the intended trustee (which can take the form of silent acquiescence – implied through conduct)</h2>

<h2>**** Additions to secret trusts must also be communicated: </h2>

<p>** Re Colin Cooper [1939] Ch 811 [each and every addition – T left 5k to two people jointly…the ST was communicated to them before the will – then T increased by 5k saying in the will ‘they know what to do’ – they didn’t – it wasn’t communicated in T’s lifetime – the first 5K was on ST the second 5K on resulting trust back to the estate]</p>

<h2>**** Complete constitution of the secret trust</h2>

<h2>**** Query: Do secret trusts have to comply with Law of Property Act 1925 s.53?</h2>

<p>** Kasperbauer v Griffith [2000] WTLR 333 [property left to his wife to sell and divide proceeds to kids – ‘the wife ‘knew what she had to do] Then he changed his mind – left the kids with nothing. The original words were equivocal </p>

<p>** Ottaway v Norman [1972] Ch  698 [testator made a will leaving bungalow and contents to housekeeper – p.f. absolutely. T’s son visited and T said in front of the housekeeper that he had made a will but that she should leave everything to the son after her death. She remained silent. She left to a friend. There WAS a ST – she implied by her silence that she agreed – she should and could have spoken up if she disagreed [also Moss v Cooper 1861]</p>

<p>Special Rules governing Fully Secret Trusts</p>

<p>**** A beneficial gift [£10,000 TO X – x is the prima facie beneficiary] of property to the fully secret trustee under the will or intestacy in question</p>

<h2>**** Communication of the trust to the fully secret trustee must take place at any time during the lifetime of the testator – irrelevant whether the ST was communicated before or after the will is created</h2>

<p>**** If precatory words are used – the rule that a trust must appear on the face of a will in order to be a <i>half</i> secret trust will not be satisfied and the courts may find a full ST Irvine v Sullivan 1869</p>

<h2>**** Communication can be constructive – Re Keen [1937] Ch  236 ie the communication can be in the form of a sealed letter handed to the secret trustee with instructions not to open until death – but must be handed to him during the lifetime of the testator</h2>

<h2>**** There is nothing to stop a fully secret trustee from being one of the beneficiaries of the trust</h2>

<p>** Moss v Cooper (1861) 1 J &amp; H 352</p>

<p>** Irvine v Sullivan (1869) 8 Eq 673 </p>

<p>** Re Boyes (1884) 26 Ch D 531</p>

<h1>Special Rules governing Half Secret Trusts</h1>

<h2>**** A non-beneficial gift [£10,000 to x on trust for purposes I have communicated to him – x is prima facie only a trustee] of property to the half secret trustee under the will in question.</h2>

<h2>**** Communication of the trust to the half secret trustee before or at the same time as the making of the will [Blackwell v Blackwell 1929] why?? Viscount Sumner – to prevent future unwitnessed dispositions by merely naming a trustee and leaving the purpose to be supplied later</h2>

<h2>**** Communication can be constructive but must not contradict the terms of the will – Re Keen [1937] Ch 236 [as above – the secret trust was invalid as the letter contradicted the will]</h2>

<h2>**** The half secret trustee cannot be one of the beneficiaries of the half secret trust</h2>

<p>** on the testator and the beneficiaries [<b>ie s9 Wills Act 1837 – the courts will not allow a statute to cloak a fraud – it won’t allow unjust enrichment by a ST or allow a fraud on the testators intentions] Doesn’t really work for half ST’s – the trustee is clearly stated to be a trustee</b></p>

<h2>**** That secret trusts operate outside the will [this is now the key theory - the ST operates dehors/outside of the will – it is created inter vivos</h2>

<p><b>ST’s and the conflict with the Wills Act</b></p>

<p>** the situation where the secret trustee witnesses the will</p>

<p>** the situation where the secret beneficiary witnesses the will</p>

<p>*** Wills Act 1837, s.15 – a witness to a will or their spouse can’t benefit</p>

<p>*** Re Young [1951] Ch 344 – however in a ST it IS NOT a will – dehors – so that a secret beneficiary or their spouse CAN witness and benefit [all ST’s] – here T told his wife that he wanted 2k to go to the chauffeur – he witnessed – still benefited</p>

<p>** the situation where the secret trustee dies before the testator or intestate</p>

<p>*** Wills Act 1837, s.25 - beneficiaries must survive the testators</p>

<p>*** Re Maddock [1902] 2 Ch. 220 – in a fully ST – if the ST dies first the fully ST fails; half ST – perhaps different – equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee – see …</p>

<p>*** Re Smirthwaite’s Trusts (1871) LR 11 Eq.251 – as long as the purpose is known then the half ST can be enforced – illogical distinction?</p>

<p>** the situation where the secret beneficiary dies before the testator:</p>

<p>*** Wills Act s25 – a beneficiary must survive the testator</p>

<p>*** Re Gardner (No.2) [1923] 2 Ch.230 - a beneficiary under a ST received his interest when the trust was created – so his death first does not defeat the ST – seems to imply that a constructive trust arises as soon as the trust is communicated</p>

<p>** the situation where the secret trustee disclaims</p>

<p>*** Blackwell v Blackwell [1929] AC 318</p>

<p>*** Re Maddock [1902] 2 Ch. 220</p>

<h1>Are Secret Trusts Express, Implied, Resulting or Constructive Trusts?</h1>

<p>**** Half secret trusts have been held to be express trusts. Whether there are any relevant authorities on fully secret trusts is a matter of dispute between the commentators, most of whom think that they are not express trusts. Every possible view has been expressed by one commentator or another as to the correct classification of both types of secret trusts. You need to form your own view on the issue. </p>

<p>** Law of Property Act 1925 s53 – problem – if they are express – for land – MUST be in writing/deed – if constructive – no need</p>

<p>** Re Baillie (1886) 2 TLR 660</p>

<p>** Ottaway v Norman [1972] Ch  698 - seems to suggest CT – implied? </p>
