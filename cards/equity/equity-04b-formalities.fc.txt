CATEGORY Formalities
CITATION Thomas v Times Books (1966)
SUMMARY Concerning the BBC radio dramatisation of _Under Milk Wood_. Takes manuscript with him on a drinking bout in Soho -- loses it. Phones agent, Cleveden. Asks for copies. Gets them in the nick of time, at London airport departing for the States. Relieved, gratefully tells agent _he could keep the manuscript_, if he could find it. Goes to the pub Thomas'd been drinking at, finds it. 
SUMMARY "I've had 18 straight whiskies; I think thatâ€™s the record"
SUMMARY Thomas's widow, the plaintiff in the action, then sued the agent.
HELD An inter vivos trust of chattels may be validly established by the settlor saying of the property: "you can keep it, if you can find it."

HELD A trust of land for which there is no evidence in writing signed by the settlor is unenforceable rather than void. 

NAME Rochefoucald v Boustead
CITATION Rochefoucald v Boustead [1897] 1 Ch 196
CATEGORY Formalities
HELD The signed writing of a settlor attesting to a trust of land need not be contemporary with the trust's creation. Formality rules may not be applied should doing so facilitate fraud, as |equity will not allow a statute to be a cloak for fraud|.







NAME Onslow v Wallis
CITATION Onslow v Wallis (1849)
CATEGORY Formalities; Dispositions of Equitable Interests; Subtrusts
HELD Subtrusts can be _active_ -- the trustee of which, the beneficiary of the original trust, still retains some part of the original beneficial interest; or _passive_ -- in which _all_ the beneficiary of the original trust transfers _all_ the beneficial interest to the beneficiary of the subtrust. The original beneficiary, therefore, 'drops out of the picture.'  
HELD Active subtrusts constitute the _only_ reliable means of avoiding the requirement of S53(1)(c) when disposing of an equitable interest.



NAME Oughtred v IRC 
CITATION Oughtred v IRC [1960] AC 206
CATEGORY Formalities; Dispositions of Equitable Interests
HELD If the beneficiary of an equitable interest concludes a specifically-enforceable contract to transfer that interest to a third party, then because the law considers a _constructive_ trust to have arisen in favour of the buyer at the moment the contract is concluded, the disposition falls outside the scope of the S53(1)(c) requirement (that dispositions of subsisting equitable interests be in signed writing) because of S53(2), which explicitly excludes resulting and constructive trusts.  Nevertheless, stamp duty may be payable on any subsequent writing as to the disposition.
