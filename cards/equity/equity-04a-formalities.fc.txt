SUMMARY ~*Intro*~
SUMMARY ~*Trusts of Personalty*~
/_Rule_ -- no formalities are needed for the creation of express inter vivos trusts of personal property, an oral declaration is enough. |Thomas v Times Books|.

SUMMARY ~*Trusts of Land*~
/_Rule_ -- S53(1)~(b)~ |LPA 1925| requires _evidence in signed writing_ of the trust trust and its terms, for an inter vivos express trust of which any part of the subject is land.
@ The evidence may come _later_.
@ Without it, the trust is not void but _unenforceable_. |Gardner v Rowe|.
/ ... although nothing prevents the trustees from upholding the trust.

SUMMARY _Exceptions_ -- S53(1)(b) may be _disapplied_, should a trustee be relying on it to swindle the beneficiaries. |Rochefoucald v Boustead|. The rationale: |equity will not allow a statute to be an instrument of fraud|.

SUMMARY ~*Trusts of Subsisting Equitable Interests*~
/_Rule_ -- S53(1)~(c)~ |LPA 1925| requires the disposition _itself_ must be in signed writing, rather than merely signed _evidence_ as for land.
@ N.B. this might be _email_ -- per Briggs J, obiter in |Pearson v Lehman Bros|.

SUMMARY Within the meaning of Disposition in S53(1)(c) --
@ *Assignment to a third party* of the beneficial interest, directly by the original beneficiary. |Timson's Executors v Yerbury|.
@ *Instructing bare trustee to hold for someone else*. |Grey v IRC|.
@ *Declaration of a |passive sub-trust|* (in which the original beneficiary drops out of the picture).

SUMMARY Outside S53(1)(c)
@ *Declaration of an |active sub-trust|* (in which _some_ actions remain for the beneficiary of the super-trust). 
  

SUMMARY _N.B._ --
@ Signed writing _asking_ the trustee to effect a transfer is _not_, itself, a disposition.
