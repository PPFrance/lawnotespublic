NAME Milroy v Lord
CITATION Milroy v Lord 
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts; Incompleteness
HELD For equity to step in and complete an imperfect gift, the settlor must have done _everything required by the nature of the trust property_ to ensure it was transferred. Where a trust fails, equity will _not_ construe the donor's words to make the donee a trustee, as to do so imposes obligations not entailed by a gift.

NAME Re Rose (of 1949)
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts; Incompleteness
HELD Although equity will not compel an imperfect gift to be completed, it may not consider a gift to be so, where the donor did _everything within their power_ to divest themselves of the property. In such circumstances, it will step in and complete the transfer. Approved in a later case with the same name and the same Judge.


NAME Re Rose (of 1952)
AKA Re Rose
CITATION Re Rose [1952] EWCA Civ 4
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts; Incompleteness
SUMMARY The transferor intended to make a gift of shares to his wife; he completed the relevant documentation, and in _March_, delivered it to the company in question. The company didn't register the transfer until _June_. Had they done so March, no tax would have been payable on them by the donor.
HELD Equity will complete a transfer when the transferor has done _everything within their power_ to achieve the transfer.

NAME Choithram v Pagarini
AKA Choithram
AKA TCP
CITATION Choithram v Pagarini (2001)
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts; Incompleteness
HELD When the donor to a trust is also a trustee, |equity will not strive officiously to defeat a gift|, and so may complete an imperfect gift which would fail on |Re Rose| grounds.  It could be argued that, TCP being in extremis and drifting in and out of consciousness, he _did_ in fact do everything within his power to divest himself of the property, _everything in his power_ naturally being a function of his _circumstances_.



NAME Pennington v Waine
AKA Pennington
CITATION Pennington v Waine [2002] EWCA Civ 227
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts; Incompleteness
SUMMARY Google “Pennington McGhee QC Harold”
@ Share declaration transferring shares from Ada to Harold (Pennington?) left in desk drawer.
@ Then she died. Under Milroy, transfer not completed. Trying to give a gift, no attempt to create a trust. Share transfer needed to qualify Harold to be a director, presumably of her company.
@ Court decided on TCP grounds. Unconscionable to go back on Ada’s wishes.
@ But why would TCP’s new equitable maxim step in to make a man a company director?
@ Arden LJ: “equity tempers the wind to the shorn lamb” x 3.
@@ CdT: "This is actually a plagiarism from a Frenchman who died 400 years ago."
@@ Retrofitted into Psalm 6 verse 2.
@@ All of this is according to de Than. Book chapter called “Equity’s Special Tenderness”
@ Pennington v Waine is basically Milroy v Lord. But decided the other way, because of TCP.
@ Arden LJ: policy reasons.
@ N.B. this case ignores Pehrsson v von Greyerz (1999) PC.
HELD Equity will not step in to complete an incomplete gift given ambivalently, except where not doing so would be unconscionable. (Approved |Choithram|, but subsequently doubted in |Zeital|).


NAME Zeital v Kaye
AKA Zeital
CITATION Zeital v Kaye (2010)
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts; Incompleteness
HELD The |Re Rose| doctrine, that the donor must do _everything in their power_ to divest themselves of the property,  is still good law. Notwithstanding contradictory dicta in |Pennington|, a donor's change of heart has never been capable of being _unconscionable_.





NAME Fletcher v Fletcher
CITATION Fletcher v Fletcher (1844)
FLAGS Key
AKA Fletcher
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts
SUMMARY An unprecedented attitude to IP rights, implications of which are that every time you make a promise, the promisee could sue on it. Which would make things a little complex.
SUMMARY Claire thinks it was wrongly decided. 
/_This chap Fletcher:_
@ owned a farm, had an immense fortune, keeping his wife in the dark about the size of his wealth or the number of illegitimate sprogs he'd sired.
@ died.
@ without having made provision for the bastards -- _could have used a secret trust, but didn't._
@ but had written a deed of covenant leaving £60,000 for any of them reaching the age of 21.
SUMMARY _But:_
@ But no one knew about the covenant, which was found in a desk drawer.
@ One child _did_ make it to 21, and promptly sued to enforce the covenant.
@ He won, as the court found the father had held the covenant on trust for the son.
HELD Given that a promise is a chose in action, a piece of intangible intellectual property, a promise can be held on trust. 
HELD There were, then, two trusts. 
@ The primary trust of the cash, and
@ *The promise to create the trust*.
HELD This is clearly madness. Wigram LJ, says Claire, was "out of date by about 30 years on contract and equity."
@ There used to be something called meritorious consideration. Relied on Williamson, which was the leading case on meritorious consideration.
@@ Seemed to be using an outdated rule on certainty of intention.
@ Followed by (at least) 13 cases in CA and HL, which Claire thinks is quite a lot.
@ The textbooks say it isn't much used.

NAME Re Cooke's ST
CITATION Re Cooke's ST (1965)
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts; Fletcher Cases
SUMMARY Son had promised father, seeking to avoid tax, that if he sold any family-owned portraits, then money would go to him. Son gave Rembrandt's Titus to his wife, "on the understanding" that she'd sell it."
HELD Buckley LJ -- |Fletcher| couldn't be applied to property that didn't yet exist. The _proceeds of sale_ of a thing are not the same thing as the thing.


NAME Lloyd's v Harper
CITATION Lloyd's v Harper (1880)

NAME Don King v Frank Warren
CITATION Don King Productions v Frank Warren (1999)
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts; Fletcher Cases
HELD Even though no submissions were made on |Fletcher|, the principle was nevertheless used in the judgment, the judge apparently keen to flaunt his familiarity with the more arcane shafts and crevices of equity.










NAME Strong v Bird 
CITATION Strong v Bird (1874)
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts; Rule in Strong v Bird
HELD The failure of a gift will be perfected should the legal title to the property vest in the donee when the settlor dies, by virtue of the donee being an executor.



NAME Re Ralli
CITATION Re Ralli's Will Trusts [1964] Ch 288
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts; Rule in Strong v Bird
HELD If someone was intended to be a trustee should end up with the _right_ property, but by the _wrong_ means, doing so would nevertheless give them the ability to carry out the trust -- which is what they must do.
HELD "A sorry example of equity abused" -- Meagher and Lehane (Australia)
