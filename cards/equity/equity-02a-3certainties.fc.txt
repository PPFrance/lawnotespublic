TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Three Certainties
SUMMARY _How the sausage of the Private Express Trust is stuffed._
SUMMARY A private express trust must be certain of -- *intention*, *subject* and *object*. Eldon LC in |Wright v Atkyns|, Langdale LJ in |Knight v Knight|.

@*|Certainty of Intention|*, without which, the disposition is an *absolute gift*.
@*|Certainty of Subject|*, without which, it *results back* to the settlor/testator.
@*|Certainty of Object|*, resulting back in default, as above.

SUMMARY The courts _try_ to respect the wishes of the settlor/testator and uphold the trust if they can. |McPhail v Doulton| per Lord Wilberforce.
SUMMARY The settlor must be _sui juris_, and this might not be certain until 'sooner after' the 18th birthday. |Edwards v Carter|

-- SUMMARY ~*Intro*~
-- SUMMARY *|Certainty of Intention|*
-- @Equity looks to intent rather than form -- did the settlor _intend_ to create a trust, or something _other_ than a trust?
-- @It has to be more likely than not (on the balance of probabilities) that the intention was _not_ to give a gift, but rather, create a trust For this there should be (documentary) evidence of the intention was to oblige the recipient to accept the responsibilities of trusteeship 
-- @Not much evidence sought to prove this before the C18th, but _Executors Act_ 1830 established need for clear action or clear language 
-- SUMMARY *|Certainty of Subject|* 
-- @A trust must be for property, real, chattel or intangible Vagueness of description defeats a trust -- |Palmer v Simmonds| (but not always |Re Golay|) 
-- @A trust for certain chattels amongst many must be segregated from the rest -- |Re London Wine|, but no segregation is necessary for true fungibles, such as shares or money -- |Hunter v Moss|

NAME Certainty of Intention
AKA Intention
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Three Certainties
SUMMARY _Certainty that the settlor intended to create a trust, rather than give a gift. In the absence of which, it's an absolute gift._
SUMMARY *Details*
@ The test is whether the trust's creator intended someone else to be under a duty to hold the property for someone else. |Paul v Constance|.
@ Intention is assessed objectively, on the evidence. 
@ Therefore, |Precatory Words| can torpedo it. |Re Adams and Kensington Vestry|.
@@ But not always -- such words should be seen in light of the whole will. |Re Hamilton|.
@@ With enough emphasis, a wish _can_ turn into an obligation. |Comiskey v Bowring-Hanbury|.
@@ It's ultimately up to the court. |Lambe v Eames|.  
@ The word _trust_ is not per se of massive significance. What matters is the reality. |Re Kayford|.
SUMMARY *Status*
@ Is certainty of intention a rule of law, or a task of construction?


NAME Precatory Words
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Three Certainties; Certainty of Intention
SUMMARY _Terms in wills expressed in language of a blousy, cap-doffing, baroque, morbid, choked-up, over-courteous and theatrically-solemn nature; toeing but not crossing the semantic frontier between the *imperative* and the *merely hopeful.*_ |Re Adams and Kensington Vestry|.

SUMMARY *Details*
@ Whether or not they amount to a gift or a trust is a matter for the judge. |Lambe v Eames|.
@ To be seen in light of the whole will. |Re Hamilton|.
@ Not a problem if copy-pasted from a term upheld in court. |Re Steele's WT|.
@ Could indicate a |Fully-Secret Trust|.

SUMMARY *Specimens*
/_Successful_ --
@'Absolutely in full confidence' |Comiskey v Bowring-Hanbury|
SUMMARY _Unsuccessful_ --
@'It is my desire' |Re Diggles|
@'Feeling confident' |Mussoorie Bank v Raynor|
@'In full confidence' |Re Adams and Kensington Vestry| 
@'I wish them' |Re Hamilton|
@'In the fullest confidence' |Re Williams|
@'I specially desire' |Re Connolly|
@'I request that' |Re Johnson|






NAME Certainty of Subject
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Three Certainties; Certainty of Subject
SUMMARY _That the trust is for *some* property, which must either be clearly described by the settlor/testator, or be ascertainable. Without this, the property results back to the settlor._

SUMMARY *Uncertain Description*
@ Vagueness about _quantity_ defeated certainty of subject in early cases. _Bulk_ in |Palmer v Simmonds|; potentially _no property_ in |Sprange v Barnard|.
@ A more 'pragmatic' approach was taken in |Re Golay| (1965).

SUMMARY *Wine and Gold* 
@ *Chattels must be segregated*, if contained within a larger body of non-trust property. |Re Goldcorp|.
@@ Unless they are _strictly_ fungible. The bottles in |Re London Wine| were held _not_ fungible, on the observation that of two bottles from the same case, one may be corked, but the other, good.

SUMMARY *Shares and Money*
@ When _any fifty would do_, the requirement for segregation does not apply. |Hunter v Moss|, followed by Neuberger J in |Holland v Newbury|.
@ In |Pearson v Lehman Bros|, the approach taken in Australia in |White v Shorthall|, of imposing a trust for the _whole_ of the body into which the subject is mixed, with beneficial interests in proportion. 

SUMMARY *Multiple Beneficiaries* 
@ Ambiguity as to the distribution of beneficial interest between multiple beneficiaries.



SUMMARY *Problem Questions*
/Argue all possibilities. 
@How should the goods be construed, and what cases would apply? 
@Are they tangible/intangible? 
@Fungible or non-fungible?



NAME Certainty of Object
TYPE Concept
SUMMARY _To be able to carry out the settlor's wishes, the trustees must be able to identify *for whom* the property is to be beneficially held._
SUMMARY *Details*
@ No cases on this since |Re Baden (no. 2)| in 1972.
@ The nature of each tests, as applied to each type of trust/power, is *different*

SUMMARY *Tests*
+*Essential Test -- Complete List* 
/Can a complete list be made of the beneficiaries, when the trust is established? |IRC v 
+*Conceptual Test*
/Does the description of the class of beneficiaries 
+*Evidential Test*
/Could _any given postulant_ be said to be a member of the class of beneficiaries? |Re Baden (no. 2)|.




@A *fixed trust* is one in which the settlor has said who gets what beneficial interest, _fin d'histoire_ So this is the least flexible, as the trustee has bollocks-all choice
@There is also the *mere power*, that can be chosen to be exercised or not Over this, the courts have no jurisdiction -- excepting fiduciaries with mere powers, but that's different
@In between the *fixed trust* and the *mere power*, there’s the *discretionary trust*, in which the trustee(s) *must* choose:
++*Who* the beneficiaries are to be; 
++*What* they should each received; or
++Both *who* and *what*
@A *power in the nature of a trust* is a fourth thing of rarity, usually arising, says CdT, out of _fuckings-up of the drafting of wills_: the settlor _tried_ to give choices to trustees, but failed and gave to someone else 
@There is also a *gift subject to a condition* In equity there’s a presumption that _gifts don’t really exist_, apart from for _fathers_ transferring property to their children or _husbands_ to their wives
@@So, CdT informs us, if she got married (which, she says, would be impossible -- although she tells us she can't say why) and transferred some of her vast wealth to her husband, a resulting trust would arise and she’d get it all back Wut?

Trusts v powers: 

•	Trust is imperative, a power is discretionary 

    ϖ	Powers can be given to trustees (fiduciary power) which may require trustees to distribute the property or only to consider whether the property should be distributed or not 
    ϖ	Can be given to third party in either fiduciary or non-fiduciary capacity 


•	Question of interpretation – compare with words creating trust 
¬   	Note the significance of a gift over in default 

Possibilities: 

•	fixed trusts 
•	discretionary trusts
•	power of appointment 
    ¬	fiduciary 
    ¬	non-fiduciary 
•	trust power – Mettoy Pension Trustees Ltd v Evans [1990] 1 WLR 1587
