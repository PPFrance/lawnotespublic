TYPE Case Overviews
CATEGORY Three Certainties
SUMMARY *General*
@*|Wright v Atkyns|*
/{<– per Lord Eldon "first... the word must be imperative...; secondly... the subject must be certain...; and thirdly... the object must be as certain as the subject">}
@*|McPhail v Doulton|*
/{<Softening the _fixed list_ test for |certainty of object|, Lord Wilberforce held a trust will not fail for uncertainty of object, if there is _sufficient practical certainty_ in its definition such that it could be said of _any given postulant_ whether or not they belong to the class of beneficiaries.>}

SUMMARY *Certainty of Object*
@*|Re Baden (no. 2)|*
/{<The CA accepted the trust as valid, although the test was interpreted in three different ways by the judges, in regards to the determination of conceptual and evidential certainty.>}

SUMMARY *Certainty of Intention*
@*|Paul v Constance|*
/{<The essence of the requirement of certainty of intention is that the creator of the trust intended to cause someone to be under a duty to hold property for another.>}
@*|Re Challonner Club|*
/{<Ambiguity and discrepancy in the conditions under which money separated off from a company's main funds in order to attempt to protect it from creditors, if the company went bankrupt, was enough to defeat the claim that an express trust had been created.>}

SUMMARY *Certainty of Intention - Precatory Words*
@*|Re Adams and Kensington Vestry|*
/{<The wording did not establish an intention to create a trust; it established merely a *wish*.>}
@*|Lambe v Eames|*
/{<A provision in a will that left property to the testator's wife "to be at her disposal *in any way she may think best* for the benefit of herself and her family" had not successfully established a trust. Obiter, that the question of whether |precatory words| vitiate the establishment of a trust is for the judge.>}
@*|Re Hamilton|*
/{<Precatory words must be read in the context of the whole will before deciding whether or not they create a trust.>}
@*|Re Diggles|*
/{<_Desire_ -- precatory words.. etc.>}
@*|Comiskey v Bowring-Hanbury|*
/{<From the word 'absolutely,' in 'absolutely in full confidence,' an inference could be drawn that the testator was not merely expressing a wish, but referring to an existing arrangement.>}

SUMMARY *Certainty of Intention - Precatory Words - Boilerplate*
@*|Re Steele's WT|*
/{<Wynn-Parry LJ -- copying from a will that _had_ been held to be a trust elsewhere _did indeed_ establish a trust, as doing so clearly establishes intention to create a trust.>}

SUMMARY *Certainty of Intention - The word 'Trust'*
@*|Re Kayford|*
/{<Opening and putting money in an account named 'Customers' Trust Deposit Account,' was, in the circs of ominous finances, enough to establish intention to create a trust (with company as both settlor and trustee with customers as beneficiaries).>}

SUMMARY *Certainty of Subject - Identification of Trust Property*
@*|Palmer v Simmonds|*
/{<A trust will not be upheld if the description is vague. A will attempting to establish a trust for 'the bulk of' an estate was *not* upheld.>}
@*|Sprange v Barnard|*
/{<A description of the subject of a trust which leaves open the possibility of _containing no property at all_, will fail for a lack of certainty of subject.>}
@*|Re Golay|*
/{<A will leaving someone a _reasonable income_ and the right to live in _one of_ the testator's flats, without specifying which, was _upheld_.>}
@*|In the Estate of Last|*
/{<Should there be uncertainty as to the property comprising the residue of an estate, a trust purporting to have it as its subject matter will fail for a lack certainty of subject. A will attempting to do so for "anything that is left" failed, and was held instead to be an absolute gift.>}

SUMMARY *Certainty of Subject - Segregation of Chattels*
@*|Re London Wine|*
/{<Physical segregation of chattels is necessary to identify the property of a trust, so the attempt to establish a trust by the purchasers failed.>}
@*|Re Goldcorp|*
/{<Even when each chattel comprising a trust fund is inscribed with means of unique identification, storage with non-trust fund property will defeat certainty of subject. Furthermore contractual dealings generally lack the *trust* and *confidence* that are the hallmarks of fiduciary duties.>}

SUMMARY *Certainty of Subject - Intangible Property*
@*|Hunter v Moss|*
/{<A trust of part of a fungible mass such as a shareholding or a bank account will not fail for uncertainty of subject, so long as the size of the part is not uncertain. 5% of 1000 _identical_ shares equals 50 shares -- the trust was upheld. Any 50 of the 1000 shares would have done. Distinguished |Re London Wine|.>}
@*|Holland v Newbury|*
/{<Neuberger J followed the ruling of |Hunter v Moss| earlier the same year, in which the rule requiring segregation of trust property from a larger mass was found not to apply to fungible intangibles.>}

SUMMARY *Certainty of Subject - Identification of Trust Property - Intangible Property*
@*|White v Shorthall|*
/{<In the Court of Appeal in New South Wales, on very similar facts to |Hunter v Moss|, the problem of identification of the shares belonging to the claimant of the trust was neatly circumvented by finding that the settlor had declared the _entire fund_ a trust, with herself and the claimant as beneficiaries.>}
@*|Pearson v Lehman Bros|*
/{<Briggs J, obiter -- 1. the principle of |White v Shorthall| (which side-stepped the problem of identification of unsegregated trust property by contriving to find a trust had been declared by the settlor for the _entire_ fund, with both settlor and real beneficiary as beneficiaries of _unequal_ proportions) is preferable to the binding authority.  2. Electronic documentation was sufficient to satisfy the requirement of S53(1)(c) LPA.>}

SUMMARY *Certainty of Subject - Identification of Trust Property - Jurisdiction over Beneficiaries*
@*|Boyce v Boyce|*
/{<Equity has jurisdiction over trustees, not beneficiaries. A trust with more than one beneficiary in which the size of each's share of the cake is determined as a consequence of a choice to be made by a particular, designated beneficiary, is valid -- and the court cannot compel the beneficiary in question to make the choice.>}

NAME Case Overviews for Formalities
TYPE Case Overviews
CATEGORY Formalities
SUMMARY *General*
@*|Thomas v Times Books|*
/{<An inter vivos trust of chattels may be validly established by the settlor saying of the property: "you can keep it, if you can find it.">}
@*|Gardner v Rowe|*
/{<A trust of land for which there is no evidence in writing signed by the settlor is unenforceable rather than void.>}
@*|Rochefoucald v Boustead|*
/{<The signed writing of a settlor attesting to a trust of land need not be contemporary with the trust's creation. Formality rules may not be applied should doing so facilitate fraud, as |equity will not allow a statute to be a cloak for fraud|.>}

SUMMARY *Dispositions of Equitable Interests - Subtrusts*
@*|Onslow v Wallis|*
/{<Subtrusts can be _active_ -- the trustee of which, the beneficiary of the original trust, still retains some part of the original beneficial interest; or _passive_ -- in which _all_ the beneficiary of the original trust transfers _all_ the beneficial interest to the beneficiary of the subtrust. The original beneficiary, therefore, 'drops out of the picture.'>}

TYPE Case Overviews
CATEGORY Constitution of Trusts
SUMMARY *General*
@*|Fletcher v Fletcher|*
/{<Given that a promise is a chose in action, a piece of intangible intellectual property, a promise can be held on trust.>}

SUMMARY *Fletcher Cases*
@*|Re Cooke's ST|*
/{<Buckley LJ -- |Fletcher| couldn't be applied to property that didn't yet exist. The _proceeds of sale_ of a thing are not the same thing as the thing.>}
@*|Lloyd's v Harper|*
/{<Son promises to pay off debt, father signs to say he'll pay in default.>}
@*|Re Flavell|*
/{<A promise to pay an annuity of £350 was deemed to have been held on trust for the beneficiary.>}
@*|Don King v Frank Warren|*
/{<Even though no submissions were made on |Fletcher|, the principle was nevertheless used in the judgment, the judge apparently keen to flaunt his familiarity with the more arcane shafts and crevices of equity.>}

SUMMARY *Rule in Strong v Bird*
@*|Strong v Bird|*
/{<The failure of a gift will be perfected should the legal title to the property vest in the donee when the settlor dies, by virtue of the donee being an executor.>}
@*|Re Ralli|*
/{<If someone was intended to be a trustee should end up with the _right_ property, but by the _wrong_ means, doing so would nevertheless give them the ability to carry out the trust -- which is what they must do.>}

NAME Case Overviews for Secret Trusts
TYPE Case Overviews
CATEGORY Secret Trusts
SUMMARY *General*
@*|Kasperbauer v Griffiths|*
/{<Modern CA authority on the conditions for secret trusts. Per Peter Gibson LJ -- "the authorities make plain that what is needed is:  1. an *intention* by the testator to create a trust, satisfying the traditional requirements of three certainties (...) 2. the *communication* of the trust to the legatees, and 3. *acceptance* of the trust by the legatee, which can take the form of *silent acquiescence*.">}
@*|Ottaway v Norman|*
/{<An oral FST of land was _upheld_. The evidence for existence of the trust, which gave the land to the testator's chauffeur, was an overheard phone conversation. Overheard by the _chauffeur_.  At no point was |S53(1)(b)| mentioned, although one skeleton had 's.53(1)(b)?' scribbled in the margin.>}
@*|Brown v Pourau|*
/{<An oral secret trust of land was held valid. Obiter -- 'but not in England.'>}
@*|Moss v Cooper|*
/{<Anything other than _positive rejection_ by the trustee of an FST is acceptance of trusteeship, including _silence_. Even if the testator dies immediately after communicating with the trustee. Old, but still good law.>}

SUMMARY *Fully Secret Trusts*
@*|Re Maddock|*
/{<Should the trustee of an FST predecease the settlor, the trust will fail.>}
@*|Irvine v Sullivan|*
/{<|Precatory words| may be compatible with a |Fully-Secret Trust| -- but without a clear obligation of trusteeship on the face of the will, they cannot establish a |Half-Secret Trust|.>}
@*|Walgrave v Tebbs|*
/{<The intended trustees of an |FST| must have been informed of the terms whilst the testator was still living. The testator merely having written instructions to the trustees is _not_ enough.>}
@*|Re Boyes|*
/{<The settlor of an |FST| must communicate not only the fact of trusteeship to the intended trustees -- but also the _terms_ of the trust.>}

SUMMARY *Half Secret Trusts*
@*|Blackwell v Blackwell|*
/{<An |HST| was upheld despite communication to the intended trustees _the next day_. The rule that communication of the terms to the trustees of an HST _before or at the same time_ as the will's creation is that the trust exists from the moment the deed of will is executed, the terms of which are implicitly part of it.>}
@*|Re Keen|*
/{<Even though a term in a will establishing an |HST| refers to _future_ communication of the trust's terms to its trustees, if the communication has in fact already taken place, the HST will be deemed to have been established. Although in this case, it failed on other grounds. "A ship sailing under sealed orders is sailing under orders, although the captain doesn’t know the destination until later. *Problem question*: a trustee given an envelope, understanding it to contain terms of HST, but instructed *not to open until death* of settlor -- *valid HST.*>}
@*|Re Bateman|*
/{<A letter containing the terms of an |HST| written _before_ the execution of the will, but only given to the trustee _afterwards_, will not be considered to be valid communication of terms to the trustee prior to execution of the will.>}
@*|Re Rees|*
/{<The trustee of an |HST| cannot be one of its beneficiaries -- especially if he or she happens to be the solicitor who drafted the will. Evershed MR -- a lot of wank about public policy, etc.>}

SUMMARY *Dehors the Will*
@*|Re Snowden|*
/{<Megarry VC -- secret trusts are in fact formed inter vivos. The will merely puts them together, i.e., _constitutes_ them.>}

CATEGORY Third Party Liability

SUMMARY *Knowing Receipt*
@*|Nelson v Larholt|*
/{<Foreshadowing Peter Gibson J in |Baden| -- the receipt of *eight* cheques drawn on an estate's account by an executor ought to have put the recipient 'on a path of inquiry.'>}
@*|Baden v Soc Gen|*
/{<For |Knowing Receipt|, knowledge can be decomposed into: 1. actual knowledge; 2. wilfully shutting one's eyes to the obviou; 3. wilfully and recklessly *failing to make enquiries* an honest person would have made; 4. knowledge of circumstances which would *indicate the facts*, to an honest and reasonable man; and 5. knowledge of circumstances which would put such a man *on a course of inquiry*.>}

SUMMARY *Knowing Receipt - Meaning of Knowledge*
@*|Cowan de Groot v Eagle Trust|*
/{<For |Knowing Receipt|, a third party's knowledge of breach of fiduciary duty may be inferred from knowledge of a gross irregularity, e.g., a sale's substantial _undervalue_.>}
@*|Re Montagu|*
/{<A distinction must be drawn between having *notice* of something and *knowing* about it. These are not the same, and merely having notice is not enough for |Knowing Receipt|.>}

SUMMARY *Knowing Receipt - Beneficial Receipt by Creditor*
@*|Agip Africa v Jackson|*
/{<Money paid into a bank account in credit is held on trust by the bank for the holder of the account; but money paid into an account in debt entails a transfer of beneficial interest to the bank -- and therefore, _beneficial receipt_ by the bank.>}
@*|MT Realisations v Digital Equipment Co|*
/{<As in |Agip Africa|, a creditor who, in payment of a debt, receives money taken in breach of fiduciary duty or trust _is_ in beneficial receipt.>}

SUMMARY *Knowing Receipt - Meaning of Knowledge - Unconscionability*
@*|BCCI v Akindele|*
/{<The classification of knowledge from |Baden| is of no particular value in knowing receipt. The test should be one of _unconscionability_. But in a commercial context, nothing short of the 3rd |Baden| level of knowledge will do. An interest rate two percent higher than the market average will not be enough.>}
@*|Armstrong v Winnington|*
/{<The disapproval of the CA in |Akindele| notwithstanding, the categories of knowledge identified in |Baden| are of useful application to measure the _unconscionability_ preferred to _knowledge_ in |Akindele|.>}

SUMMARY *Knowing Receipt - Defences - Change of Position*
@*|Phil Collins v Davis|*
/{<A defence against recovery of property knowingly received by a third party may be established if the property received led to a significant change in the position of the third party.>}

SUMMARY *Dishonest Assistance*
@*|Royal Brunei v Tan|*
/{<In the Privy Council -- |Dishonest Assistance| requires dishonesty rather than merely knowledge. Whether through actions, or passively through a lack of probity, dishonesty must be measured against how an honest person would have behaved in the circumstances. A person may therefore have a clear conscience, but by this standard nevertheless be dishonest.>}
@*|Barlow Clowes v Eurotrust|*
/{<|Twinsectra| was wrong in adding to the objective test for dishonesty of |Tan|. 'Knowledge of the transaction has to be such as to render the participation contrary to normally acceptable standards of conduct. It does not require that the defendant should have had any reflection about what those normally acceptable standards were.'>}
@*|Abou-Rahman v Abach|*
/{<The EWCA followed |Eurotrust| (PC) in preference to |Twinsectra| (EWCA). The appropriate test for dishonesty was whether the standards of conduct would permit the acts in question.>}
@*|Starglade v Nash|*
/{<Albeit purporting to follow |Twinsectra|, the subjective element was nevertheless irrelevant. The test for dishonesty was generally to be *objective* -- but ultimately, the courts are at liberty to decide on the test to be applied to each pattern of facts. That a large body of opinion should dissent as to honesty is also irrelevant.>}
