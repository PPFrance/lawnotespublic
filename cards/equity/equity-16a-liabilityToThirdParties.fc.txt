@@For which, see at least |Baden| and |BCCI v Akindele|.

NAME Knowing Receipt
AKA Unconscionable Receipt
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Fiduciary Duties; Knowing Receipt
CATEGORY Third Party Liability
SUMMARY A third party receives something where he has _knowledge_, of which |Baden| established five fuzzy degrees, or, in |Armstrong v Winnington|, _unconscionability_. In commercial situations, |Akindele| confirms 1-3 will be enough to establish the claim; in other situations, 1-5.
SUMMARY *Elements*
+*Disposition of Property in Breach of Trust or Fiduciary Duty*
+*Beneficial receipt* 
@@That the receipt is beneficial is rebuttably presumed by the fact of transfer -- |Agip Africa v Jackson|. which established that money paid into an overdrawn account _is_ received beneficially. Approved in |MT Realisations v Digital Equipment Co|.
+*Knowledge*.
@@Since |Armstrong v Winnington| this is also *unconscionability*. 
@@The spectrum of |Baden|, disapproved of in |Akindele|, nevertheless holds. 1-3 in a commercial context, 1-5 otherwise. 
@@This excuses bona fide donees and purchasors. 
SUMMARY |Knowledge for Knowing Receipt| is a live issue in most of the cases. 
@|Akindele| leads, but |Armstrong v Winnington| comes a close second.

AKA Knowledge for Knowing Receipt
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Third Party Liability; Knowing Receipt
SUMMARY In |Baden v Soc Gen|, Peter Gibson J, set out what have become known as *the five degrees of knowledge*. In decreasing order of certainty and difficulty to establish in court.
SUMMARY _They are_ --
+Actual *knowledge*.
+*Wilfully shutting one's eyes to the obvious*.
@@You don't know, but you _know_, because the circumstances are screaming at you.
+Wilfully and recklessly *failing to make enquiries* an honest person would have made.
+Knowledge of circumstances which would *indicate the facts* to an honest and reasonable man.
+Knowledge of circumstances which would put such a man *on a course of inquiry*.
SUMMARY *Which count?*
/_All five?_
@In the '50s in |Nelson v Larholt| Denning J found knowledge in the failure to go on a *path of inquiry* in fishy circumstances -- Baden *5*
SUMMARY _Only the first three?_
@In |Cowan de Groot v Eagle Trust|, knowledge would only be imputed when *Gross irregularity* was ignored -- Baden *3*. A similar ratio as as |Carl Zeiss v Herbert Smith|.
@In |Re Montagu's Settlements|, a distinction was drawn between *notice* (which was not knowledge) and *knowledge* (which was).
SUMMARY _Currently..._
@The leading case is |BCCI v Akindele|, in which, even while doubting the utility of the |Baden| criteria, it was held that *1-5* are knowledge for non-commercial circumstances; but only *1-3* in commerce. 
@|Armstrong v Winnington| purports to have reconciled the two, by seeing the test in terms of _unconscionability_ rather than knowledge.

SUMMARY *Defences*

NAME Dishonest Assistance
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Third Party Liability
CATEGORY Third Party Liability; Dishonest Assistance
SUMMARY The issue is usually not whether there has been assistance, but whether there's been enough |dishonesty|. The current binding authority is _technically_ |Twinsectra| (EWCA), which added a subjective element to the objective measure of |Tan| (PC). However, |Tan| was preferred in |Eurotrust| (PC), which was followed domestically in |Starglade v Nash|. 
SUMMARY *Elements*
+*Fiduciary duty or trust of property. 
+*Breach of duty by fiduciary or trustee.*
@@Originally (|Barnes v Addy|) the _breach_ itself had to be dishonest, not just the assistance.
@@ Removed to prevent dishonest assistance _failing_ when a fiduciary had been duped into the breach by the third-party, the fiduciary themselves having acted with probity.
@@This is *strict liability* -- but the court has the power to excuse an innocent breach.
+*Assistance by the 3rd Party*, which cannot be *inaction*.
@@A passive role is not enough. 
/{Query -- money 'passively' arriving in an account, observed but left unmolested by the third party? Presumably as soon as he touches it, that would be enough?}
+*|Dishonesty|* of the third party.
/Which party has the burden of proof is somewhat blurred.
