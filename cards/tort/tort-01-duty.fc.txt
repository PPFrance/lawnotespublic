AKA Donoghue	
YEAR 1932
CATEGORY Negligence; Duty of Care
CITATION Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562
COURT UKHL
FLAGS Key; Development; EPLR
SUMMARY The claimant suffered shock and gastroenteritis as a result of discovering the ice-cream float she'd consumed was made with ginger beer from a bottle in which there was a _partially-decomposed snail_. This all took place in Paisley, in a confectionary shop run by one Francis Minghella. 
SUMMARY The case's significance is that it  --
@Established the *independence* of tort and contract.
@Recognised the existence of a *general* tort of negligence.
@Did so as an essentially *flexibility* tort, per Lord Macmillan.
HELD There is a duty to take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions likely to injure those who a reasonable degree of foresight would suggest might be affected by the act, i.e., your *neighbour*. 
HELD Lord Atkin, famously -- 'you must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law, is my neighbour? The answer seems to be â€“- persons who are so _closely and directly affected by my act_ that I _ought reasonably to have them in contemplation_ as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.'
HELD Lord Buckmaster, dissenting -- quoting Alderson B in an earlier case, "The only safe rule is to confine the right to recover to those who enter into the contract; *if we go one step beyond *that, there is *no reason why we should not go fifty*." 
HELD Then -- 'In |Mullen v Barr| (1929), a case indistinguishable from the present excepting upon the ground that a mouse is not a snail, and necessarily adopted by the Second Division in their judgment, Lord Anderson says this "In a case like the present, where the goods of the defenders are widely distributed throughout Scotland, it would seem little short of outrageous to make them responsible to members of the public for the condition of the contents of every bottle which issues from their works".' 
 

COMMENT The modern take on Donoghue v Stevenson -- perhaps because there simply isn't anything left to say about it -- is that, in any case, she was 'mistaken' about the dead snail. Bullshitting about it, that is.

 --  -- an early example of what Armando Iannucci refers to as a _Jock Wop_.


NAME Duty of Care
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Negligence; Duty of Care
SUMMARY Where a duty of care must be established; not arising in common law or statute -- as it does, e.g., between doctors and patients, employers and employees, one road user and another: |Nettleship v Weston| -- the following general test was established in |Caparo v Dickman|.
+*Was the damage reasonably foreseeable?*
+*Was there a relationship of sufficient proximity between claimant and defendant?* |Everett v Comojo|.
+*Would it be fair, just and reasonable* to impose the duty?* 
@@A presumption has arisen against imposing duties on public bodies, especially the emergency services, for reasons set out in |Hill|. 
@@See |Hill|, |Osman v Ferguson|, |Kent v Griffiths|, |Vowles v Evans|.
SUMMARY |Donoghue v Stevenson| --
@Gave us the *neighbour principle*, still useful to throw in as a basis for *(2)* in the |Caparo| test. 
@Remained good law until |Anns v Merton|. There, the test became *(1)* a sufficiently-proximate relationship based on _foreseeability_, *(2)* absence of public policy considerations militating against a duty.

COURT UKHL
FLAGS Important; Test; EPLR
CATEGORY Negligence; Duty of Care
SUMMARY Tenants in a block of flats claimed for damage due to structural defects caused by foundations inadequately-deep by _six inches_. They claimed the defendant owed a duty of care to have inspected the foundations, prior to construction. 
HELD Lord Wilberforce introduced a _two-stage test_ to establish a duty of care -- *(1)* a relationship of *sufficient proximity based on foreseeability*; *(2)* the absence of *public policy considerations* that should preclude there being a duty.  (Note that causes the |Donoghue| principle to be a function of foreseeability, not really proximity/neighbourhood per se).
COMMENT It was not until |Murphy v Brentwood| that test was formally overruled, at least insofar as it applied to public authorities.

HELD Lord Bridge introduced the famous *three-stage test* to measure whether a duty of care is owed between parties -- *(1)* the damage must be *reasonably foreseeable*; *(2)* a relationship of *sufficient proximity* between claimant and defendant; and *(3)* it would be *fair, just and reasonable* to impose the duty.

SUMMARY A teacher became obsessed with a 14-year boy. How obsessed? He changed his name from Paul Pagett Lewis to Paul Ahmet Osman -- Ahmet Osman being the name of the boy. He'd told police he might do something _'criminally insane.'_  And so he did. He went to the boy's house and shot both the boy and his father.

SUMMARY A severe asthma attack resulting in brain damage. Sued the London Ambulance Service in negligence as Ambulance took 40 minutes to arrive.
HELD The ambulance service would owe a duty of care if (i) further illness reasonably foreseeable should no ambulance attend (i) they took the call and dispatched an ambulance (proximity), (iii) fair, just and reasonable, but only if delayed _for no good reason_. 
/->-Obiter, of the other emergency services -- the _police_ don't have a duty to attend if they answer a call. When the _fire brigade_ turns up, they have a duty _not to make things worse_.

CITATION Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1989] AC 53
COURT UKHL
FLAGS Leading; EPLR
SUMMARY Family of the last victim of the Yorkshire Ripper sued the police in negligence for having been slothful in catching the killer.
HELD The police should not *generally* owe a duty of care to members of the public for |Caparo| (3) public policy reasons -- fear of defensive policing; the fact that the police already take their job seriously enough and that imposing a duty of care to the public wouldn't make them any better at policing; inappropriate to use courts rather than the Police Complaints Authority; if there _were_ liability, _some_ lawsuits would inevitably succeed against them, diverting time and money from actual policing.

SUMMARY The defendant company had acquired a disused cinema, which they intended to knock down and replace with a supermarket. Vandals broke in and found a stash of celluloid film, to which they set fire. In the subsequent blaze, the establishments neighbouring the cinema were damaged.
HELD An empty cinema was not per se a source of danger. Although the danger was foreseeable, under Caparo (3), it would be unreasonable to impose the burden of guarding the building 24/7.

SUMMARY A motorcyclist, whose view, as he pulled out of a junction, was obstructed by a bank of earth, smashed into a car and was injured. He argued that the local council, having negligently failed to remove the obstacle, had breached the duty of care it owed to road users such as he.
HELD Only when there was a public duty to act, and failing to do so would be irrational, would it be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty on local authorities. Statutory powers, furthermore, do not per se give rise to a common law duty of care.




#Lecture 3: Duty of Care: Public Authorities
NAME Duty of Care - Public Authorities
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Negligence; Duty of Care; Public Authorities
SUMMARY The courts are _generally_ reluctant to find a duty of care owed by a limb of the state fulfilling a public service and ordinary members of the public. 
SUMMARY For this proposition, |Hill| is good authority. It identified four considerations, at least as applied to situations involving the police.
+*Fear of defensive policing*
+*Police already doing their best*
@@The extra benefit extracted by threat of actions in tort would not be great enough to justify a general .
+*Police Complaints Authority* is the proper channel for complaints against the police, not the courts.
+*Time and money* spent defending and paying out on claims in negligence would divert cash from its rightful destination. 

SUMMARY However, Lord Keith's speech in |Hill| also good authority for the *_absence_ of a blanket ban*.
SUMMARY Where a claim has failed or been struck out on the basis of |Caparo| (3), this is not per se an infringement of the claimant's art. 6 right to a fair trial -- |Osman v UK|, |Z v UK|.

The court held that a blanket ban on police duty of care would indeed be a violation of (2) but on the facts, found for the UK.

HELD Parents couldn't sue, only the children: the duty of care doesn't extend to them. Doctors owe a duty to the children, not the parents. Are the interests of the child different from the interests of the parent? The court thought so, but Jesse Elvin is sceptical.

Lower courts, followed Lawrence: interests of child important, interests of parent less so. 
HELD In Strasbourg court, article 8 claim: UK acting through hospital prevented him from seeing his seriously-ill daughter. Court held that hospital incompetent for not diagnosing sooner; claim valid, compensation awarded.

So the police took an hour to arrive, by which time she was dead. Claim that two police authorities had been negligent, and that article 2 (right to life) breach because of their incompetence. 
HELD Negligence claim must fail on same grounds as |Hill|, but article 2 breach accepted. Acceptable and coherent (!) that tort law should reject claims of this sort in negligence but that Human Rights accept them. In this sense HR is helpful in sorting out a grey area.
