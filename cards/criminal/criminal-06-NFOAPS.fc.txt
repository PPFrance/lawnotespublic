AKA Assault
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Non-Fatal Offences
SUMMARY *~Assault~*
/*AR* -- D causes V to fear immediate application of unlawful force. (No violence need transpire.)
@*Cause of fear*
@@Can be *words alone*, as long as cause fear of imminent violence -- |Constanza|.
@@Unless the words *negate* the gestures. |Tuberville| -- 'if it were not assize time, I would run you through with this sword.'
@@Can be *silence/heavy breathing* -- |Ireland and Burstow|.
@*Immediacy*
@@Given broad interpretation. |Smith v Woking Police| -- V locked inside house, D outside peering in at her. 'Immediate' enough for the CA.
@@Satisfied even when D not at all proximate to V -- |Ireland and Burstow|.

SUMMARY *MR* -- |Specific intent| or subjective |recklessness| as to causing the fear of immediate violence.


SUMMARY ~*Battery*~
/*AR* -- Unlawful application of force.
@*Force*
@A mere touch is enough. No need for pain or harm. 
@No requirement for  need to be _force_, conventionally understood -- |DPP v Kaye|, acid in the hand-drier.
@*Application*
@Can be *directly* or *indirectly* applied. In |Fagan|, car on foot of bobby.
@No need to have assaulted beforehand -- no need to have caused apprehension of the violence. |Haystead|, sleeping baby V2, dropped and injured when mother, V1 struck.
SUMMARY *MR* -- |intention| or |recklessness|.

NAME Assault Occasioning ABH - S47
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Non-Fatal Offences
SUMMARY Assault in S47 is *assault or battery*. 
SUMMARY *AR* -- |Assault| or |battery|, from which *more than merely trivial* harm is caused to V.
@ *Harm: Physical*
@@ Must be *more than merely trifling* -- |Donovan|.
@@ Or *calculated to interfere with V's health/comfort* -- |Miller|.

@ *Harm: Psychological*

SUMMARY _So cut off someone's pony-tail, and you've done them more than merely trivial harm -- |DPP v Smith|. But punch the person you've been victimising for years, who goes on to commit suicide that evening; and as long as you didn't punch them very _hard_, you're off the hook for S47 crime -- |Dhaliwal|. Such fucked-up arbitrariness._

SUMMARY *MR* -- same as for |battery|. |Intention| or |recklessness|.



NAME Wounding or Causing GBH - S20
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Non-Fatal Offences
SUMMARY Difference from S47 of _degree_. ABH is _more than merely trivial_ where as GBH is _really serious_. 
SUMMARY *AR* -- wounding or inflicting GBH.
@*GBH*

@@Which can be psychological -- |Ireland and Burstow|.
@@Characteristics of V to be taken into account, e.g., age/health -- |Bollom|.
@*Infliction*
@@In |Clarence| in 1888, assault was necessary for infliction, and absent in consensual sex transmitting D's gonorrhoea.

@@*Direct Application of Force?*
@@@*Not currently required* -- |Ireland and Burstow|.
@@@In |Wilson|, *assault not necessary* for liability under S20 if there's *intentional and direct application of force*.
@@@Neither were previously been necessary. In |Martin| 1881, shouting 'fire' in a crowded theatre was enough.
@@*Transmission of HIV*
@@@Reckless transmission of disease through sexual intercourse = S20. |Dica|, explicitly overruling |Clarence|.

SUMMARY *Racial or Religious Aggravation*
@|Crime and Disorder Act 1998| increases penalties if this element present
@Narrow definition adopted by courts:
@|DPP v Pal|, V an elderly asian caretaker. D, a yoof, also asian, assaulted V, calling him a 'white-man’s arse-licker' and a 'brown Englishman.' Court held race irrelevant to attack.


NAME Wounding or Causing GBH with Intent - S18
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Non-Fatal Offences
SUMMARY Principle difference is the MR, which requires direct intent. 


NAME Consent to Non-Fatal Offences
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Non-Fatal Offences
SUMMARY _Two things to balance together -- autonomy and paternalism. Or good old libertarianism and overbearing totalitarianism. Or something._
@Academics disagree about how consent really applies? Does it ablate the actus reus and make it lawful? Or, as uncle Al has argued, is it really an exculpatory defence?
@A fight in a playground vs. a fight in a boxing ring? |AG Ref no. 6 of 1980|
@Consent has been carved out by _ad hockery at its best_ -- AD.

SUMMARY *Principles*
@*S20*
@@Cannot be consented to -- |Brown|.
@@Unless it's just a "loving adnorment"  -- |Wilson|. 
@@@Russell LJ: not like Brown at all, a loving married couple can lovingly adorn one another, like a tattoo, in the privacy of their own matrimonial kitchen.

--STOP--
Emmett 1999
Lighter fluid on breasts, set alight. But no skin grafts.

- EWCA: different from Wilson, funnily enough. ‘A line-drawing exercise in every case about consent, validity, and personal autonomy.’

Slingsby 1995
Caution, as not properly argued. Did there have to be foresight of harm for there to be liability?
D involved in vigorous sexual activity, double fisting. Signet ring ripped open a blood vessel, V died.

Consent in HIV?

Dica 2004
D had infected two former partners.

- Trial judge: wholly irrelevant whether V knew of D’s condition, as consent of victim was irrelevant. Why? Because of Brown. Couldn’t consent to an S20 level harm, so liability here.
- EWCA ordered retrial, as trial judge’s analysis ‘fundamentally incorrect.’ Absolutely not like Brown, as dissimilar facts, prima facie unlawful. Here, informed sexual autonomy.
- E.g., Catholic couple, husband HIV+, who want a child.

Conzani 2005
Informed consent, HIV transmission, risk of infection, S20 harm.

- Obiter: where D does not disclose their HIV status but victim has informed consent from another source, e.g., hospital/doctor, then there may not be liability.
- The effect of which is a revivication of the Dadson argument, that a (kind of) unknown justification defence is being relied upon.

Barnes 2005
Leading case on sporting injury vs assault, footballer tackled from behind.

- Where does the line get drawn?
- At least, here, challenge was so late and violent as could not be held to be a heat-of-the-moment misjudgement.
- Court set out some precepts jurors should consider in future, a bit like gross negligence manslaughter:
    - Occurred in heat of moment?
    - Serious enough to be criminal?
    - Type of sport inherently violent?
    - Level being played at?
    - Nature of the act?
    - Degree of force?
    - Extent of risk of injury?
    - What was state of mind of D?

A public policy exception for manly diversions.

- Jones 1986

Given birthday bumps, then dropped. Severe spinal injuries. Court held rough horseplay. (!).

- Aitkin 1992

In an army barracks, rough horseplay in this case was setting the victim on fire. But that’s what you’d expect in an army barracks, the court held.

Deception

Richardson 1998
A dentist, treated a patient, charged with GBH. Liability, and no vitiation of consent in S47, and none from common law about nature of act or person.

Tabassum 2000
Represented that medically qualified and conducting breast cancer survey. Fondled three victims.

- Court held at common law, not just nature or act and identity of person; there can be a vitiation of consent where the deception is about the fundamental nature of the act.

Dica

- Court said obiter that victim may have been fraudulently deceived about risk of disease itself, no deception about act of intercourse. So couldn’t be rape, but curiously could be S20.

So consent is never a defence to a common-law battery, unless it fits within a public policy exception.
