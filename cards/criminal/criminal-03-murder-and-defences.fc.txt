NAME Mercy Killing
AKA Sanctity of Life
CATEGORY Manslaughter
SUMMARY *Mercy*
@In |Re A|, liability for homicide for an operation that would inevitably kill one twin -- in default of which both would die -- boiled down to whether the act would _avoid evil_.
@The last case in the HL sought clarification on circs for prosecution for assisting suicide (|Debby Purdy|).
@In 2010 the CA held it was up to Parliament to address suicide in context of mercy killing (but in the mean time, upheld a conviction for murder in |Inglis|).
@@In 2014 the SC said the same (|Nicklinson and Others|).
SUMMARY So it's up to Parliament. See also &g&Loi Leonetti&g& for the French approach.

SUMMARY *Cases from my notes*
/Dianne Pretty (2002)
/Poor chook had Motor Neurone disease. Applied to DPP for a letter prospectively granting her partner immunity from prosecution for helping her to end her own life.
/Held: Denied - challenged under S8 (private life) and S14 of European Convention on HR.
@ UKHL held that protection of vulnerable individuals.
SUMMARY Debby Purdy (2009)
/N.B. this was final HL decision before it became the Supreme Court.
/An MS sufferer. Sought clarification from DPP under Art. 8 (lack of guidance) on circumstances in which there would be prosecution for assisting suicide.
SUMMARY R v Inglis (2010)
/Mercy killing. Victim suffered minor injuries having been punched. Reluctantly put into an ambulance. Suffered catastrophic brain damage when fell out (jumped out, in BBC article) of ambulance. PVS. Defendant was his mother, a nurse. She went into the hospital and injected the son with heroin, once (failed) then twice (succeeded).
@ Tried to argue loss of control. But not accepted, because sheâ€™d done it twice.
@ Argued that he was already dead.
@ Court held individually disabled and not dead, in the eyes of the law.
@ Imprisoned at first instance for 5 years.
@ EWCA held it would be for parliament to determine how to readdress policy of assisted suicide.
SUMMARY R v Nicklinson and Others (2014)
@ Supreme court again held that parliament must decide, not cases, as so controversial, so technically and morally difficult.
@ Re A too slender a thread to allow the extrapolation of defence.

NAME Intention for Murder
CATEGORY Murder; Intent
FLAGS Current Law
SUMMARY For oblique intent, a jury *_may_ infer intention* (but doesn't have to) should they find *D realised death or GBH was a virtually certain consequence* (|Woollin|, or |Nedrick| according to some)
SUMMARY *Development of Law*
/For _oblique_ intent (cf. _direct_ intent, something observed prima facie), *death or |GBH|* had to be:
@|Hyam| -- known by D as a *highly probable result* 
@|Moloney| -- *foreseen as a natural consequence* (obiter, should be *the same throughout criminal law*).
@|Hancock and Shankland| -- *highly probable* once again, overturning |Moloney|.
@|Nedrick| -- *realised as a virtually certain consequence*.
@|Walker| -- *a very high probability*, which the CA, despite preferring *virtual certainty*, did not consider a misdirection.
@*|Woollin|* -- *virtually certain* per |Nedrick| -- but jury remains free _not to find intention_, even if satisfied of D's realisation of virtual certainty.
@|Matthews and Alleyne| -- reaffired *virtual certainty* of |Nedrick|/|Woollin| (obiter, an inference in favour of which would be (on the facts of the case) failure to attempt rescue). 
SUMMARY The law still unclear, but that |Woollin| established rule of _evidence_, not law.

SUMMARY *Overview*
@ It required: 
++ *A sudden and temporary* loss of control.
++ *A reasonable person* would have lost control. |Lesbini| 1914.
@Once raised, provocation had to be left to the jury. |Doughty|.

@@Evidence of the loss of control was to be left to the jury.
@@The provoking act could come from a _3rd party_.
@Failed when too much time elapsed between provocation and (purported) loss of control. |Ibrams|, in which it was a _week_.

SUMMARY *Invocation by Abused Wives*
/That the loss of control had to be _sudden and temporary_, which militated _against_ its invocation by "slow-burning" women rather than men. Say the academics.
@Failed in |Ahluwalia|, petrol poured over the husband whilst _asleep_. CA held the |Duffy| test still good law.

NAME Loss of Control - S54 CJA
AKA Loss of Control
AKA S54 CJA
FLAGS Current Law
CATEGORY Murder; Defences

SUMMARY S54 |CJA 2009| establishes this souped-up replacement for the |provocation| murder-to-manslaughter partial defence, which it abolishes at S56. 
SUMMARY *S54 - Loss of Control*
+*Three-Part Test* --
++Acts (or omissions) arising from a _loss of control_.
++A _qualifying trigger_ -- fear of _serious_ violence, circs of _extremely grave nature_ or both: S55 (3), (4) or (5).
++Which would have caused same acts in person of D's gender and age with _normal amount of self-mastery_, in _same circs as D_.
+ *No requirement of suddenness* -- addressing weakness of _sudden and temporary passion_ requirement (|Duffy|), opening defence to battered women.
+ *All circs except* those having bearing on D's ability to stay cool.
@@Except if taunt connected with it, not alcoholism (|Asmelash| 2013).  
+ *Inapplicable for revenge.* (|Dawes| 2013)
+ *Burden on prosecution to disprove* beyond reasonable doubt, once admitted.
+ *Admitted if judge decides enough evidence* raised by D (|Jewell| 2014).

SUMMARY *S55 - Qualifying Triggers*
+3 *Fear of serious violence from V* against D or another identified person
+4 *Things done _or_ said* of -- 
++ *Extremely grave character*
++ *Gave D justifiable sense* of being *seriously wronged* ('sense' not 'fear'; 'wronged' not 'injured')
+ (or both.)
+ *But not if D incited trigger* as excuse to inflict violence.
++3 *Sexual infidelity cannot be a trigger* as a thing done or said (|Clinton| 2012, but it may be _part of the circs_ -- S54(1)(c))

SUMMARY *Cases*
@Admissability 
@@Planning militates against admission of loss of control (|Jewell| 2014).
@@Not to be left to jury if mere speculation (|Barnsdale-Quean|).

NAME Diminished Responsibility - S2 Homicide Act 1957
AKA S2 Homicide Act 1957
CATEGORY Murder; Defences
FLAGS Old Law
SUMMARY The idea began with the _M'Naghton Rules_, which reduced |murder| to |manslaughter| if D sufficiently bonkers in the head.
SUMMARY *Note well* -- current text of S2 is the |S52 CJA| amendment. 
SUMMARY *S2 as Enacted*
/'Where a person kills or is a party to the killing of another, he shall not be convicted of murder if he was suffering from such *abnormality of mind* (whether arising from a condition of _arrested or retarded development_ of mind or any *inherent causes or _induced by_ disease or injury*) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing.'

SUMMARY *Cases*
@Pleading irresistible perverted desires (to stab to death then mutilate) meant the jury had to be directed on _abnormality of mind_ -- manslaughter substituted (|Byrne|)
@If D is a depressed alcoholic, what's important is the depression, not the alcoholism (|Deechman|)

SUMMARY *Alcoholism as Abnormality of Mind*
/To operate as a defence: 
@Had to have reached a point where 
++*Brain disease* causing* gross impairment* of judgment, and --
++*First drink* of day *not voluntary*. 
/(|Tandy| 1998).
@... unless there was _Alcohol Dependancy Syndrome_, in which case first drink did _not_ have to be voluntary (|Wood| 2008).
@*Premeditation negated* admissibility of abnormality (|Tulloch| 2000).

SUMMARY *Note well* -- this amended |S2 Homicide Act 1957| -- therefore is to be found on *p. 28* of Blackstone's _Criminal Law 2015-16_.
SUMMARY Diminished responsibility now requires -- 
+An *abnormality of mental functioning* (cf. 'abnormality of mind' from 1957 Act)
++from an *recognised medical condition* (see &g&DSM manuals&g&, &g&ICD brain conditions&g&) -- (|Dowds|)
++which *substantially impairs* ability 
/*(1A)* either to 
+++*understand nature of conduct* (|Golds|), or to 
+++*form rational judgment*, or to
+++*exercise *self-control.*
++*The abnormality explains the conduct.*
SUMMARY *Academic Reception*
@Law Commission had wanted a _lack of developmental maturity_, but no parliamentary appetite. 
@MacKay, $!writing$$Crim LR 2010 4 290-302!$ in Crim LR:
++V. disappointing, esp. absence of _lack of developmental maturity_.
++Inferior to _benevolent conspiracy_ that worked well in the past.
++Does nothing about |mercy killing|.

SUMMARY *Cases*
@In |Dowds| --
@@Intermittent alcoholism will not establish the defence,
@@circumstances for which are fundamentally a matter of _public policy_.
@Unnecessary to be _sole cause_; must be _more than trivial_ and make a _real or appreciable difference_ (|Golds|).
@The CA reserves the right to substitute manslaughter when a jury ignores _uncontested_ medical evidence introduced by D.
