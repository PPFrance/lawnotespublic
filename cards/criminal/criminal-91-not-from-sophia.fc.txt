NAME AG Ref no. 6 of 1980
SUMMARY Duelling schoolboys. But with fists, and in the street. Both consented. V bruised, bleeding nose. D charged with common assault/battery.
HELD Lord Lane, discussing consent and non-fatal offences: 'no Queensbury rules here - not in the public interest to allow people to let people try to cause each other ABH for no good reason. So most fights are unlawful, but public policy exceptions apply, such as properly conducted games and sports, on which must pains must be taken to exclude. Or necessary chastisement. Or reasonable surgery.'
