NAME Strict Liability
CATEGORY Elements
SUMMARY Offences are either _mala per se_ or _mala prohibita_ (|Sweet v Parsley| per Diplock and Reed). 
@Necessity of |mens rea| is _strongly presumed_ without _compellingly clear_ evidence for leaving it aside (|B (a minor) v DPP|)
@Strict liability encourages vigilance (|Jackson| 2006).
@A profusion of new statutory offences under Blair.

SUMMARY *Examples*
@Not ensuring your children go to school (|Barnfather|).
@Gambling while insolvent (|Muhammed| 2003).
@Importing ivory (|Matudi| 2003).
@Flying just above the ground (|Jackson| 2006)
@Possessing a _stun gun_, even if you "honestly thought" it was a torch (|Deyemi and Another| 2007)
@Statutory rape (|R v G|)

SUMMARY *Determination*
/|B (a minor) v DPP| per Lords Nicholls and Steyn, factors for telling strict from non-strict:
@Language of statute -- _permitting_ or _allowing_ imply strict liability in context of driving; as does _causing_ for pollution offences; _possessing_ for drugs.
@@Cf. _wilfully_, _maliciously_, etc.
@@Rule of thumb -- the smaller the penalty, the more likely to be strict liability -- but N.B., possession of a firearm, for which a substantial helping of porridge is the condign reward. 
@Nature of the offence
@Mischief it addresses
@"Other relevant circumstances"

SUMMARY *Defences -- Ignorance of Fact*
@Drugs slipped into D's pocket without their knowledge may excuse strict liability possession (|Warner|)
@Also "not knowing" about dope in the rooms of D's lodgers (|Sweet v Parsley|) 

SUMMARY *Defences -- Honest, Mistaken Belief*
@May succeed for sexual offences for which _facts stray into margins of mischief_ of strict liability offence (|B (a minor) v DPP|).
@The belief _may_ not need to be reasonable (|R v G| 2008).

SUMMARY *Pros*
@Speeds up criminal justice
@Promotes vigilance in matters of road safety, pollution, hygiene, etc.
@Lack of stigma as not "true" crime.

SUMMARY *Cons*
@@Uses criminal law for policy goals.
@@Criminal convictions _do_ stigmatise
@@@In some circs may cause perverse swellings of honour and pride in the breast of the defendant -- ASBOs.
@@Conduct in question (usually of negligible significance, taken individually) ought to be disaggregated from "true" crime.
