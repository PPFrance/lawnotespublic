NAME Unlawful Act Manslaughter
CATEGORY Manslaughter
SUMMARY AKA _Constructive Manslaughter_, this differs with |voluntary manslaughter| in the mens rea requirement. Here it is for an _unlawful act_ -- other than GBH or murder.

SUMMARY In |Kennedy (No. 2)|, channelling Mustill J in |AG Ref no 3 of 1994| wise old Tom Bingham set out the *four elements* that must be *stated then addressed in a problem question*. The prosecution must prove:  *(1)* an unlawful act, which would *(2)* cause _some_ harm in estimation of sobre and reasonable person; and *(3)* brought about consciously and volitionally and that *(4)* causation is satisfied.

SUMMARY *Cases*
+*An unlawful act*
@@Which must be _criminal_ rather than tortious (|Larkin|).
@@For which D has mens rea and actus reus (|Lamb|).
@@@In which prosecution failed as neither assault nor |Cunningham| recklessness.
@@Failing which -- at least the mens rea (|Newbury|).
@@Can be |strict liability| (|Andrews|, CA).
@@E.g., -- 
@@@Administering a noxious substance (|Kennedy (No. 2)|) 
@@@Affray (|Carey|).
+*Some harm* in the *anticipation* of a sobre and reasonable person.
@@*Harm*
@@@Not necessarily _serious_ (|Church| 1966).
@@@But at least |ABH| (|Dawson| 1985). Distress _not_ enough on its own, unless per se gave rise to |ABH|...
@@@... which is likely in invading an old man's house, when he looks like he's having a heart attack yet D does nothing (|Watson| 1989).
@@*Anticipation*
@@@Most be foreseeable (|Church|)
@@@A heart condition is _not_ foreseeable in a 15 year-old girl (|Carey|). 
@@@The actual harm can be much worse than anticipated by hypothetical sobre and reasonable person, as long as _some_ occurred (|R v JM and SM| 2012). 
+*Volitionally brought about*
@@Mens rea for the unlawful act itself must an act of direct intention (|Kennedy (No. 2)|).
@@Not necessarily against V (|Goodfellow| 1986, but cf. |Dolby|, in which it _did_).
+*|Causation|*
@@Is satisfied by a simple lack of direct intervening cause (|Goodfellow|, cf. earlier |Dolby|).
@@No break in the chain of causation if harm _within range of reasonably foreseeable responses_ (|Williams (1991)|). 
@@@ Even when the response was _suicide_ (|Dhaliwal|, obiter in CA).


NAME Gross Negligence Manslaughter
CATEGORY Gross Negligence Manslaughter
SUMMARY AKA _Breach of Duty Manslaughter_. Doing something legal like _driving_, but going about it in a grossly-negligent manner. After |Adomako|, |Wacker| established that the duty of care is owed rather more widely than in tort. In |Willoughby| it was held the question of whether a duty was owed was for the jury. this was established In |Gemma Evans|,  


SUMMARY In |Adomako| (1995), Lord McKay set out a three-part test:
+Duty of Care owed by D to V, established by the ordinary principles of negligence.
@@AR: _'What he meant to say is that all the ordinary principles _don't_ apply.'_
+Serious or significant risk of death
@@Does it go _beyond compensation_ and amounts to _a crime _against the state_ and therefore _deserve punishment_ (the |Bateman| test) 
+Caused by D's conduct.

SUMMARY But on closer inspection, the _ordinary principles_ turned out _not_ to be those of tort, but of criminal law, which the CA helpfully pointed out in |Wacker| (2002) is different from civil law. And that this is for public policy reasons.

SUMMARY *Cases*
@That duty in _tort_ might be precluded by V's (implicit) consent is irrelevant (|Wacker|).
@Existence of duty was for the jury -- unless it was obvious, in which case the judge could direct (|Willoughby|).
@@But this did _not_ make GNM per se a breach of ECHR art 7 (|Misra|).
@@@D's argument -- because the legality of the conduct was in effect decided by the jury, the offence lacked the legal certainty art 7 requires. 
@@@CA held -- jury not being asked to decide whether conduct illegal, only whether grossly negligent.
/AR: _'Remind me how you spell *tautology*?'_
@N.B. establishment of duty established _not_ to be a question for the jury (|Gemma Evans| 2009).

NAME Reckless Manslaughter
SUMMARY AKA _|Cunningham| Manslaughter_ -- taking a subjectively-unjustifiable risk of bringing about _serious_ injury. For this common law crime there have been no prosecutions since
