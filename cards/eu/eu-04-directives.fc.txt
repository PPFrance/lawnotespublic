CATEGORY Directives
SUMMARY ~*Nature*~
/|Art 288 TFEU| provides that directives have an *obligation of result*, but that the member states choose how they go about achieving it.
SUMMARY Usually this means the state must enact *implementing legislation*. This is called *transposition*. Directives are therefore *somewhat elastic*.
SUMMARY They come with a *Date of Entry* and a *Transposition Deadline*, by which the directive must be fully enacted in domestic law. 
SUMMARY ~*Vertical Direct Effect*~
/|Van Duyn| establishes that they can be relied upon *directly*, i.e., that they have *direct effect*, if after the transposition deadline, in whole or in part, they remain unimplemented at national law.
/In the intervening period, states must *disapply national measures liable to compromise the result* - |Adeneler| [2006].
SUMMARY |Marshall| established that the state as *employer* was subject to vertical direct effect, and in |Foster| it was held that, in a gloweringly-Orwellian turn of phrase, any *emanation of the state* would do. Cf. |Horizontal Direct Effect|.
SUMMARY ~*Indirect Effect*~
/Established by |Von Colson|, this is TODO
SUMMARY ~*Incidental Effect~*

SUMMARY |Faccini Dori| demurred from establishing *horizontal effect* (N.B. strongly dissenting opinion of AG Lenz), but ruled that national courts are under a duty to interpret conflicting national law *purposively*, the purpose being that of the directive.
SUMMARY  The argument can be put that in providing a very sizeable proportion of a modern state's workforce (the part employed by the government) with a set of rights not available to the rest, |Marshall| introduced quite a radical inequality. One might even suspect the intention was to set up a status quo that _had to yield_ to the inevitable establishment of |Horizontal Direct Effect| -- but that hasn't happened.

NAME Adeneler
CASENUM C-212/04
CITATION Adeneler [2006] I-6057
CATEGORY Directives; Jurisdictional Expansion; Transposition Period
HELD In the period between entry of a |Directive| but before expiration of its transpose by date, a member state must not only not enact other measures that could compromise the attainment of the result, but also disapply measures that might jeopardise the result.

CITATION Van Duyn v Home Office [1974] ECR 1337
CATEGORY Directives; Vertical Direct Effect of Directives
SUMMARY The Home Office had sought to exclude a Dutch woman on the basis that, being a Scientologist, she was undesirable.
HELD After the transcription deadline, in certain circumstances, a directive (or the bits of it not yet transcribed) can be relied upon directly. Just because |Art 288 TFEU| gives regulations direct applicability, it does not follow that in all circumstances, directives cannot have similar effects.

CITATION Pubblico Ministero v Ratti [1979] ECR 1629
CATEGORY Directives; Vertical Direct Effect of Directives
HELD A state may not rely on its failure to transpose a directive. Freestyling eurojudges even go so far as to draw a parallel with estoppel.
HELD [22] 'Consequently a member-State which has not adopted the implementing measures required by the directive in the prescribed periods may not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the directive entails. 
/[23] It follows that a national court *requested* by a person [...] *not to apply a national provision incompatible with the directive not incorporated* [...] *must uphold that request if the obligation in question is unconditional and sufficiently precise.* {Van Gend criterion} 
/[24] Therefore [...] *after the expiration of the period fixed *for the implementation of a directive *a member-State may not apply its internal law*--even if it is provided with *penal sanctions*--which has not yet been adapted in compliance with the directive, to a person who has complied with the requirements of the directive.'

SUMMARY A woman was _sold an English course whilst waiting for a train_ in Milan. She was swindled--but Italy had not yet implemented the Directive on Doorstep Selling, which in such circumstances required a cooling off period of 28 days. 
HELD Although there is no horizontal direct effect for directives (even if the |Van Gend| criteria are met), national courts must must interpret existing law for the purpose of the directive.
HELD 30. '[...] in the absence of measures transposing the directive within the prescribed time-limit consumers cannot derive from the directive itself a right [...]. However, when applying provisions of national law, whether adopted before or after the directive, the national court must interpret them as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive.'
