CITATION Procureur du Roi v Dassonville [1974] ECR 837
WIKILINK  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procureur_du_Roi_v_Benoît_and_Gustave_Dassonville
CATEGORY Non-Fiscal Restrictions; Quantitative Restrictions; Art 34 TFEU; First Phase
FLAGS BE; FR; SCO
SUMMARY Belgian law allowed Scotch, and various other products, to be sold only with a certificate of origin. Dassonville had bought on the cheap in France, however, where there was no such requirement, and so no such certificates. Resourcefully, he *made some himself* -- and was duly prosecuted for forgery. He challenged the legality of he requirement.
HELD "5. All trading rules enacted by Member States which are *capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially*, intra-Community trade *are* to be considered as *measures having an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions*."

AKA Irish Souvenirs
CASENUM C-113/80
CITATION Commission v Ireland (Irish Souvenirs) [1981] ECR 1625
CATEGORY Non-Fiscal Restrictions; Quantitative Restrictions; Art 34 TFEU; First Phase
FLAGS EU; IE
SUMMARY Irish legislation required a _souvenirs_ produced outside Ireland to be marked with their origin. In the Commission's opinion, this would potentially harm trade. Ireland's view was that the measure protected consumers, who naturally wanted to know where an item they bought was produced. 
HELD Consumer protection is *not* a valid derogation from the prohibition on QRs and MEQRs, of which the complete list (is provided by |Art 36 TFEU|.




NAME Simmenthal v Minister for Finance
CASENUM C-35/76
CITATION Simmenthal v Minister for Finance [1976] ECR 1871:
CATEGORY Non-Fiscal Restrictions; Quantitative Restrictions; Art 34 TFEU; First Phase
FLAGS IT
SUMMARY 
HELD Compulsory systematic or sporadic veterinary inspections carried out on livestock amounted to an measure of equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction. Given the requirement that importers of livestock carry certificates attesting to the health of the animals, such a measure was disproportionate, and had no |Art 36 TFEU| defence.
HELD TODO Giulia's note -- "Italian authority said the measure was necessary to protect public health, and guess what? Public health is in article 36. The reason is that Article 36 is not made to allow national law to derogate from national law, it does not give member state a free hand to do whatever they wish in this area. Article 36 must justify a provision, knowing that the measure must be necessary and proportional in order to protect the non fiscal interest. Who decide if the measure is proportional and necessary? This is a matter of EU law. "

FLAGS EU; IE
SUMMARY In an effort to stimulate its sluggish agricultural sector, Ireland organised and funded a campaign to get the Irish to "Buy Irish".
HELD A publicity campaign orchestrated by a nation state to encourage its citizens to discriminate in favour of domestically produced products is a measure of equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction.

NAME Commission v France (Spanish Strawberries)
AKA Spanish Strawberries
CASENUM C-265/95
CITATION Commission v France [1997] ECR I
CATEGORY Non-Fiscal Restrictions; Quantitative Restrictions; Art 34 TFEU; First Phase
FLAGS FR; ES
SUMMARY French farmers -- the most pampered and subsidised farmers in the world, and also the most truculent and childish -- blockaded péage booths, stopping Spanish lorries full of strawberries from going about their business. "Pas content!" Pygmy-brained wankers. Taken to court by the Commission, France argued *it* had nothing to do with the protest. The court observed that they *did* in that they *could* have stopped it but chose not to. France tacitly threatened the Court with the blame for the civil unrest which, it intimated, may follow a finding against them -- feelings were very strong; security issues, etc. Meanwhile, the strawberries rotted in lay-bys.
HELD A member state is liable for a breach of Art 34 if it does not prevent or stop a blockade targeting specific imports.
