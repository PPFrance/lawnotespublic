TYPE Concept
FLAGS EU
CATEGORY Free Movement of People; Citizens; Citizenship
SUMMARY First appearing at |Maastricht|, this is the idea that rights should be given to the *non-economically active*, as well as workers. |Art 18 TFEU| provides for non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality, without reference to the categories of people to whom it might refer. |Art 20 TFEU| boldly establishes *Citizenship of the Union* as an additional (rather than replacement) nationality. At *2(a)*, it accords them the right to move and freely reside anywhere in the EU -- albeit with limits. 
SUMMARY |Art 21 TFEU| explicitly provides for what happens if the situation envisaged *doesn't* arise naturally -- at *2*, provisions adopted by the Parliament and the Council, according to the |Ordinary Legislative Procedure|, and at *3*, the Council, according to the |Special Legislative Procedure|.
SUMMARY Just as for |Art 45 TFEU|, the enjoyment of these rights is contingent on having *crossed a border*.
SUMMARY Detail is coloured in by the |Citizens Rights Directive - I|, stipulating the different conditions applying to stays of differing lengths, and how the member state must treat you -- |Citizens Rights Directive - II|.
/See also |Citizens Rights Directive - Digested|.
SUMMARY ~*Swarthy, Benefit-Scumming Scroungebags*~
/Although most of the cases turn on technical issues, the exquisitely-sensitive bigger picture is more than worthy of consideration. |Dano| and |Alimanovic| rip to shreds the _Daily Mail_ paranoia about knuckle-dragging benefit tourists from Eastern Europe (or ought to, if that view were susceptible to debate), as does a quick glance at the black-letter treaty and directive provisions. Some will be emboldened, some will be disheartened, to note the recent jurisprudential gathering-up of skirts to the extent that 'EU Citizenship' has apparently dropped out of the Court's vocabulary. Its reluctance in |Zambrano| is clear; its relief not to have to follow it in |McCarthy|, clearer still.

TYPE Concept
FLAGS Fundamental
CATEGORY Free Movement of People; Citizens; Citizenship
SUMMARY *~Intro~*
/Elaborating on |Art 20 TFEU| and |Art 21 TFEU|, this paints in detail about *who* has rights, *what* they are, and what the *exceptions* are.

SUMMARY *~Scope~ (Arts 2-3)*
/*Art 2* defines *citizen* and *family member*, etc. *Civil partners* are included _*if*_ the domestic legislation of the host state treats them as equivalent to spouses.
/*Art 3* provides the necessity to live in *another member state* to have these rights. 
/*Art 3(2)(a)* extends residence rights to miscellaneous other non-Citizen family members where 'serious health grounds strictly require the personal care' of the citizen family member. 
SUMMARY *~Residence~ (Arts 6, 7 and 16)*
SUMMARY *Art 6* 
+*Up to 3 months*, in any member state *without formalities* other than having ID/passport.
@@On condition (Art 14) of not becoming *an _unreasonable_ burden* on the social assurance system of the state -- i.e., no *benefit tourism*. 
@@Without (Art 24(2)) any right to *social assistance*.
+Applies too to non-citizen family members may accompany.
SUMMARY *Art 7* 
+*3 months* to *5 years*, if:
++They're *economically active* in the host state; *or* 
++have *sufficient resources not to become a burden* on the social assistance programme of the host state *and* ...
/... have *comprehensive sickness insurance*. But it would be disproportionate to interpret 'comprehensive' too strictly -- |Baumbast|, and the insurance should cover, but need not necessarily be held by, the citizen -- |Zhu and Chen|.
@@@Thresholds for being a burden are not to be set by member states. Being a burden is a fact for each case.
++Or be a family member accompanying a citizen who fulfils (a), (b) or (c). 
+Or be a *non-Citizen* family-member accompanying a citizen fulfilling 1(a), (b) or (c) -- |Zhu and Chen|.
+You still have the status of *worker* if you're no longer employed because *(a)* you're ill, *(b)* you got sacked after more than a year of work and have registered as a jobseeker. But if  *(c)* your fixed-term contract of less than a year ended, then you're still a 'worker' for six months only.
/*(d)*, you retain the status of worker if you're doing retraining *related to* the previous employment.
SUMMARY @The member state can require registration.
@@Although it cannot rely on a failure to register when a its own national would not have to do so -- |Martinez Sala| 
@It can expel you on *proportionate* and *case-specific* grounds. E.g., |Van Duyn|, which turned on Art 27 and 28.
@The *right to equal treatment* of Art. 7 of the Directive begins *after one year*.
SUMMARY *Art 16*
+*Permanent residence* is from *from five years onwards*, and of course also applies to
+non-Citizen family members.
+The clock is not reset by *temporary absences* amounting to more than six months a year (or longer ones for, e.g., compulsory military service, pregnancy, serious illness, study, 'posting' in another member state)
+But being absent from the host state for two years on the trot lands you on a snake leading back to Art 6. 
SUMMARY *~Equal Treatment~ (Art 24)*
/At (2), this gives three restrictions on free movement: 
@No social assistance during first three months.
@No rights to social assistance for job-seekers.
@No obligation to grant maintenance aids for studies (including for vocational training). 
SUMMARY The directive's preamble asserts that the rights granted are subject to not *unreasonably burdening* the member state. 
SUMMARY In the previous year-and-a-half to two-years, there has been *a distinct change of direction* in the case law. 

NAME Equal Treatment - Social Assistance
TYPE Concept
SUMMARY ~*Evolution*~
/The court originally interpreted |Art 18 TFEU| on equal treatment *broadly*, treating EU Citizenship as unshakable and primordial. By contrast, the recent and unfortunate almost-total boiling away of |Permissive Consensus| is reflected in |Dano|, |Alimanovic|, and |McCarthy| reiterates the need to have crossed a border.
SUMMARY ~*Social Assistance*~
Para 2 of |Art 24 CRD| *excuses* the host state from having to provide *social assistance* --
@For |Art 6 TFEU| residents (< 3 months, or longer where appropriate -- see |Art 14 CRD|).
@Also from having to provide *student maintenance* to other than permanent residents under |Art 16 CRD|...
@@..uUnless they can show *some degree of integration* -- |Bidar|.
SUMMARY However --
@*Child-rearing allowances* may *not* be withheld by the host state for failure to comply with a requirement *not* imposed on a national of the host state -- |Martinez Sala|.
@*Minimum-subsistence allowances*, likewise, may *not* be conditional on nationality -- |Grzelczyk|.
@@Because, although extending such benefits to nationals from other member states would impose a burden, it would not be an *unreasonable* one. In any case, member states should show 'a certain degree of financial solidarity.' (!)
@|Art 24 CRD| restricts *student assistance* to permanent (|Art 16 CRD|) residents
@@But someone with |Art 7 CRD| rights (conceivably even |Art 6 CRD|), but who shows a degree of *integration* into the state, may nevertheless be eligible -- |Bidar|.
SUMMARY *Jobseekers* are excluded from discrimination in social assistance by |Art 24 CRD|, but may be covered by |Freedom of Movement - Workers| under |Art 45 TFEU|.
@|Collins| establishes that *the dole* may be lawfully withheld, in the absence of a *genuine link* to the host state's labour market.
@@But |Ioannidis| found that the genuine link is *not absent* merely because the person completed their secondary education elsewhere. 
@@Note that in |D'Hoop|, concerning the same 'tideover' allowance as |Ioannidis|, the claimant could rely on her EU citizenship rights *against her own country* on the flimsy grounds of having crossed a border in the past.
@@The *genuine link* is a matter for national authorities, and the success of a claim also depends on whether the *purpose* of the benefit is for *social assistance* or improving access to the jobs market.
SUMMARY It *may* be that you don't have to cross a border to benefit, in special circumstances. 
@@|Zambrano|, the judgment establishing this, is a parody of references, citations, conditions and stipulations, and is a world away from the jurisprudential boldness of earlier years -- there was a pragmatic imperative in the facts, though. 
@@Cf. |McCarthy|, in which the rationale for *not* following |Zambrano| was that McCarthy would't have had to leave the EU, unlike the citizens in Zambrano.

CATEGORY Free Movement of People; Citizens; Families; Comprehensive Sickness Insurance
FLAGS GB; DE; Essential
SUMMARY The starting point for discussing the Court's interpretation of right afforded to Citizens under |Directive 2004/38|. A German citizen, married to a Colombian, had two children. They lived in the UK. Baumbast had worked for *three* years, then travelled to Asia to work for German companies. His Colombian wife. The UK authorities *refused* to renew their residence. But they had sufficient funds under Art 7(1)(b) of the Directive, and comprehensive sickness insurance. The UK argued it was *not*, as it didn't cover *emergency care*.
HELD Article 21 TFEU is directly effective, as is the clear intention of its direct and unambiguous wording. It confers rights directly on *every citizen*, not just workers. The comprehensive sickness insurance requirement (of Art 7(1)(b) of Directive 2004/38) must be applied proportionately. It does not fail just because the insurance might not cover emergency care.

SUMMARY A French student living in Belgium applied for the 'minimex,' a minimum subsistence allowance. Belgian law provided that this was for all Belgian *citizens* and for *non-Belgian* *workers*. 
HELD Union citizenship is destined to be the *fundamental status* of nationals of the member states. They can rely on the non-discrimination provision of |Art 18 TFEU| for *all provisions of EU law*. Whilst the provision of the a benefit (e.g., the minimex) to citizens of oher member states might involve a *certain degree* of financial burden, this would not be unreasonable, and that member states should show *a certain degree of financial solidarity*. (!)
HELD Sir David Edward, the rapporteur who drafted the judgment, later explained the Court, in effect, had the choice between treating the citizenship provisions as rhetorical flourishes expressing a statement of will, or as specifically conferring rights on individuals. The choice was not obvious -- but the consideration that it would have been _absurd_ for the treaty to contain such clear and unambiguous provisions had the intention merely been the former, was what ultimately persuaded the Court.

They moved to Wales, as soon as she was born, but the British authorities told them to scram. They protested they were no burden, and that they were family members of an EU citizen.
HELD The requirements of *sufficient resources* and *comprehensive sickness insurance* of article Article 7(1)(2) of Directive 2004/38 will be met when the non-Citizen family member fulfils them: they do not have to be possessed personally by the Citizen, for the requirements to be met.

SUMMARY As in the later case of |Ioannidis|, this concerned the Belgian 'tideover' allowance,  for school-leavers not yet in employment. By contrast, Ms. D'Hoop was herself Belgian -- but she'd done her _bac_ in France. She was refused the allowance. She couldn't rely on |Art 45| rights or those of |Citizenship|, as she was in her home member state. Nevertheless, a reference was made to the ECJ. 
SUMMARY It was argued that merely having *resided* in another member state was not enough to bring the rights of EU citizenship to bear, and that the education she had received in France did not amount to the vocational (job-related) training envisaged by the treaty provisions.
HELD "Community law *precludes a member state from refusing* to grant the tideover allowance *to one of its nationals*, a student seeking her first employment, on the sole ground that that student completed her secondary education in another member state."

SUMMARY An Irishman, maybe or maybe not a toe-rag, arrived in the UK and promptly tried to *sign on*. He was refused on the basis that he was not *habitually resident*.
HELD |Art 24 CRD| para 2 does *not* give equal access to benefits, but a jobseeker is nonetheless an EU citizen, and as such, *has access to social advantages*.  However, the lack of a genuine link between the citizen and the labour market of the host state *may* be a legitimate reason to withhold, e.g., job-seeker's allowances. Evidence of such a link is likely to be demonstrated by genuine efforts to find work. A member state may impose a minimum length of residence in order to qualify, but this must not be *proportionate*. I.e., it cannot be longer than would be necessary to demonstrate a genuine link.

SUMMARY A Columbian citizen and his family, living in Belgium. His wife and eldest child were Columbian, but his two youngest were born in Belgium, hence citizens. He applied for asylum -- but was denied. However, he was not deported, due to the state of war in Colombia. He applied again and was again denied. He was employed, a contributor to the social security system. But then lost his job and applied for benefits. He had never crossed a border -- in effect, EU Citizenship rights were being claimed (by the Belgian children) against the *home* member state, not a *host* member state. 
SUMMARY A situation like this had been referred to hypothetically in |Derici|.
HELD In a notably-succinct judgment, and following |Derici|, the Court found that |Art 20 TFEU| *precludes national measures* having the effect of *depriving* citizens of the union (the children) of the *genuine enjoyment of the substance of their rights as EU citizens*.  {As Prof. Sir Alan Dashwood QC puts it, "the CJEU just can't resist being *Big Daddies* to people!"} The brevity of the judgment is perhaps best understood as a result of not wanting, in effect, to allow the parents of young EU citizens to be, in effect removed; doing so, especially to a war-zone, might be seen as _de facto_ deportation of EU citizens.
HELD "42. |Art 20 TFEU| precludes national measures which have the effect of depriving citizens of the Union of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of their status as citizens of the Union.
HELD 43. A refusal to grant a right of residence to a third country national with dependent minor children in the Member State where those children are nationals and reside, and also a refusal to grant such a person a work permit, has such an effect"
