SUMMARY An enterprising Italian lawyer, opposed to the nationalisation of his country's electricity sector, had refused to pay his bill of 1,925 Lire {just less than €1}. The nationalied electricity company sued him; he argued the nationalisation violated not only provisions against _market distortion_ in the |Treaty of Rome|, but also the Italian constitution. The question was referred first to the Italian Constitutional Court, then the European |Court|.
SUMMARY The Constitutional Court replied that although the Constitution did indeed allow for the transfer of sovereignty in some areas to organisations such as the EEC, this was independent of the commonplace rule of _lex posterior derogat legi priori_, and so as the legislation nationalising the electricity industry had come _after_ the |Treaty of Rome|, it displaced it.
SUMMARY The question then went to the ECJ.
HELD Member states and their nationals are *bound by EU law*, which *takes precedence over national law*. 
HELD Unlike _ordinary_ international treaties, the EEC Treaty/|TFEU| created its own legal system. When it came into force, it *integrated itself into the legal systems of member states*. 
HELD The member states, having created a community with its own legal personality and capacity, and capacity to represent itself on the international stage - and *real powers* stemming from a *transfer* of power to it from member states, they have *limited their sovereign rights*, albeit within limited fields.
COMMENT One may hear the claim that the _treaties_ don't mention anything about such a _limitation_ on _member states' sovereign rights_. This is true, but as a practical matter, how could it possibly have been made to fly, if it said so explicitly.

CATEGORY Supremacy; Sovereignty; National vs EU Law
FLAGS Fundamental; DE
SUMMARY A company seeking to export maize challenged the validity under the *national constitution* of the CAP export license scheme, in which the deposit for an export license would be forfeited if the would-be exporter failed to export. They claimed the measure was disproportionate as it did more than it needed to achieve its aim, and was therefore illegal under *domestic* law.
HELD The validity of Union measures is *not affected by allegations entertained by domestic courts* that by their own lights, they are invalid. *Not even fundamental* items of *national constitutional law have supremacy* over directly applicable provisions of Union law. Challenging measures adopted by the institutions in *domestic law* would ruin the uniformity and efficacity of Union law.
HELD The law from the Treaties is an *indepdendent source of law*.
HELD Anticipating the concern that this violated the sacrosanctity of the most fundamental thing in the constitutions of some countries after the war, Human Rights, the judgment reassured that - '_in fact, *respect for fundamental rights* forms an *integral part of the general principles of law* protected by the Court of Justice. The protection of such rights, whilst *inspired by the constitutional traditions* common to the Member States, must be ensured within the framework of the structure and objectives of the Community._'

SUMMARY Charges were imposed under Italian law on live imports from France for veterinary and public health inspections. The Italian court found these were contrary to |Art 34 TFEU| and ordered the government to repay with interest. The government appealed, claiming the court could not treat Italian statute as invalid and refuse to apply it.
HELD Member states have a *duty to set aside* provisions of *national law* which are *incompatible with Union law*, which is *a direct source of rights* and duties for all those they affect, *whether member states or individuals*.
HELD National courts *must*, therefore, apply Community law *in its entirety* and *protect rights conferred* by it *on individuals*.

SUMMARY A group of a hundred or so Spaniards had set up a company in England under the Merchant Fishing Act 1894, to gain the right under domestic law to fish in UK waters. To attempt to put a stop to this, the UK had passed the Merchant Fishing Act 1988, which imposed restrictions on such companies such as a requirement that boats be 75% British-owned. The company said this was incompatible with EU law. 
SUMMARY In the CA, Donaldson MR and Mann, Bingham LLJ held that *although* courts are obliged to give effect Community law, 'they were *not obliged to override national law* in favour of what is no more than an alleged or putative Community right'. Then the case went to the Lords, who made a reference to the |ECJ|.
HELD National courts must *disapply national law* in conflict with EU law. The will of Parliament in the |1972 Act| was to *limit its sovereignty*. Even though that wasn't explicit in the treaties, it was clear from the jurisprudence of the |ECJ|.  
HELD Lord Bridge - 'If the supremacy within the European Community of Community Law over the national law of member states was not always inherent in the EEC Treaty it was certainly well established in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice long before the United Kingdom joined the Community. Thus, whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary. Under the terms of the 1972 Act it has always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court, when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.'

NAME Accepting Supremacy
TYPE Concept
SUMMARY ~*UK*~
/S2(1) of the |1972 Act| is pretty damn unambiguous that treaty obligaitons to the EU, *and everything flowing from them* are supreme. Note that S18 of the |2011 Act| stipulates EU law is only effective *because of the 1972 act.*

SUMMARY ~*Poland*~
/A judgment of the Polish constitutional court in 2005 (K18/04) says it is *not* to be taken as read that, when Polish law conflicts with EU law, the latter is automatically supreme. 
COMMENT All the recent self-conscious reassertions of national legal supremacy, expressed tepidly or beligerantly, must be seen in the context of the recent drastic ebbing of the |Permissive Concensus| and popular |Distrust of the EU|
COMMENT Notice how, in each of the cases on supremacy, the national court tries to *avoid a scrap*, but waves its handbag in the general direction of Brussels. The |Court| repays the compliment, and is often careful to counterbalance a bold assertion of its supremacy with a *finding against* the person attempting to rely on its supremacy. E.g., |Van Duyn|.

WIKILINK Direct Applicability https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_applicability
WIKILINK Horizontal Effect https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_effect
SUMMARY _Not to be confused with *Direct Applicability*, relating specifically to |Regulations|_.
SUMMARY ~*Origin*~
/*Treaty articles* were established to have direct effect in |Van Gend en Loos| in 1963, but the treaties make no mention of it. The |Van Gend| Criteria for direct effect require the measure in question: is *unambiguously clear*, *prohibitive* (rather than imposing of a positive obligation), *unconditional*, contains *no room for discretion* {applies to treaty articles only} and is *not dependent on implementing national measures* {this _appears_ to disqualify |Directives|}. 
/{Remember this as *CPUDI*. *Clear*, *Prohibitive*, *Unconditional*, no *Discretion*, no *Implementing* measures.}
SUMMARY ~*Vertical vs. Horizontal*~
/*Vertical* directly effective measures are those which can be used *against the state* (to be interpreted broadly - |Marshall|), *Horizontal* directly effective measures can be used *against private parties*. The distinction was established in |Defrenne v SABENA|.

SUMMARY Under national law, trolley dollies were obliged to retire at 40, unlike their male counterparts. {Why the _hell_ would this be in any country's _law_?}.
