NAME Free Movement of Workers - Summary
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Free Movement of People; Workers
SUMMARY The |Effectiveness and Scope of Art 45| is vertical *and horizontal* (|Walrave|, |Angonese|), and requires a border to be crossed (|Boukhalfa|). 
SUMMARY The |Meaning of Worker in Art 45| requires the activity to be *genuine and effective* (|Levin|) not *marginal and ancillary* (|Raulin|). The activity has to be *economic* (|Bettray|) and *remunerated* (|Steymann|, even if very poorly |Kempf|), but can be *training* preparatory to genuine and effective work (|Bernini|). A jobseeker is a worker (|Antonissen|), but is not entitled to equal treatment w.r.t. welfare and tax (|Lebon|).
SUMMARY |Restrictions on Free Movement of Workers| may discriminate *directly* (|Levin|) or *indirectly* (|Groener|, |Angonese|) or may be *indistinctly applicable* barriers to *entry* (|Bosman|) or *exit* (|Kranemann|)
SUMMARY |Justifications for Discrimination under Art 45|(3) include public *policy* (|Bonsignore|, |Van Duyn v Home Office|), which may *not* be abused (|Adoui and Cornuaille|); *security* and *health*. 
@The Art 45(4) exception for public servic* must be *proportionate* to the particulars of the job (|Commission v Belgium I|). 
SUMMARY |Justifications for Indistinctly Applicable Measures under Art 45|, which must of course be proportionate, include *protection of culture* (|Groener|), and height of the  barrier imposed (|Kranemann|).

SUMMARY *Effectiveness* -- vertical |Direct Effect|, of course sure. H*orizontal* as well?
@|Walrave| and |Bosman|? Yes and yes And for the avoidance of doubt, Art 45 is 'not specifically addressed to member states, but is of *general* application,' -- |Angonese|.
@@This covers (at least) rules made by private bodies regulating gainful employment 'in a collective manner.' In |Walrave|, the French cycling association. In |Bosman|, FIFA.
SUMMARY *Scope* -- a border must be crossed for |Art 45| rights to be enjoyed. This can happen by:
@Going to *live and work* in another member state.
@Living in one and *commuting* into another. 
@The border may be the door of one of the other member state's *embassies* in another part of the world altogether -- |Boukhalfa|.

TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Free Movement of People; Workers; Meaning of Worker
SUMMARY ~*Workers*~
/The activity must be *genuine and effective*, as established in |Levin|, which further held it must not be *marginal and ancillary*. Its judgment held -- 
+Definition of 'worker' is *for the Union*, not the member states.
+But must be *broad*, free mov't being fundamental -- besides, *principles* ought to be *broad*, their *exceptions*, *narrow*.
+*Part time* work is *not excluded*, but the activity must be *genuine and effective*, and not *on such a small scale* as to be regarded as *purely marginal and ancillary* 
SUMMARY To be *genuine and effective*, |Lawrie-Blum| gave a _further_ three considerations -- 
@Is the activity of *(i)* economic value, *(ii)* supervised by an employer and *(iii)* remunerated?
SUMMARY The nature of *relationships of employment* was discussed in |Lehtonen|, a tad  _Street-v-Mountford_ishly. 
SUMMARY *Training* before the genuine and effective activity starts, counts as work -- |Bernini|.
SUMMARY *Remuneration below subsistence* (supplemented with welfare) does not preclude Art 45 workerdom (|Kempf|, which reiterated that what counts is genuineness and effectiveness). The remuneration may be *in kind* -- |Steymann|.
SUMMARY Being *married to the boss* is no impediment -- |Meeusen|.
SUMMARY *Irregularity* and *limited duration* of services performed may, when assessing genuineness and effectiveness, indicate instead a *marginal and ancillary* character -- |Raulin|.
SUMMARY The activity must be *economic* -- |Bettray|, although the judgment is morally and logically wonky.

SUMMARY ~*Jobseekers*~ 
/|Antonissen| decided they *are* covered by Art 45, because --
@Free mov't of workers entails nationals of member state A moving freely to member state B *and* staying there, to *seek employment*. Why? Because that *enhances the effectiveness* of Art 45 -- |Antonissen|. 
@@How long can they stay? 'A reasonable time.' In default of specific domestic legislation, this means *six months*.
@@When that period lapses, however, if the person shows evidence of continuing to seek employment for which he's qualified, the MS may not boot him out.
SUMMARY From |Lebon|, however, there is *no obligation* on an MS to treat jobseekers from other MSs equally to their own in *social and tax advantages*.

SUMMARY Belgium pro footie transfers entailed transfer fees -- by contrast, French pro footie did *not*. This rendered Bosman, a Belgian player wishing to transfer to the French club Dunkerque, much less attractive to the club than a French player of equivalent talent, for whom it would have to pay no transfer fee. Although neither obviously directly nor indirectly discriminatory, his *access to the Employment market of another member state was impeded*, he claimed, which violated his Art 45 rights.  
HELD Confirming |Walrave|, a rule set by a body governing the organisation of employment in a sport (FIFA), *having the effect* of discrimination, even if neither direct nor indirect, violates Art 45 if it impedes access to the labour market.  Nevertheless, a |Rule of Reason| approach akin to |Cassis de Dijon| *may* justify such restrictions, if the measures pursued *legitimate aims* with *pressing reasons of public interest.*

She was a chambermaid, but paid _less_ than the Dutch minimum wage -- but she had personal income from property. {What kind of chambermaid is *that*?!}.

NAME Lehtonen
CASENUM C-176/96
CITATION Lehtonen [2000] ECR I
CATEGORY Free Movement of People; Workers; Definition of Worker
FLAGS FI; BE
SUMMARY Paras. 12-14 of judgment --
/->-12. Mr Lehtonen is a basketball player of Finnish nationality. During the 1995/1996 season he played in a team which took part in the Finnish championship, and after that was over he was engaged by Castors Braine, a club affiliated to the FRBSB, to take part in the final stage of the 1995/1996 Belgian championship. To that end the parties on 3 April 1996 concluded a contract of employment for a remunerated sportsman, under which Mr Lehtonen was to receive BEF 50 000 net per month as fixed remuneration and an additional BEF 15 000 for each match won by the club. That engagement had been registered with the FRBSB on 30 March 1996, the player's letter of release having been issued on 29 March 1996 by the federation of origin. On 5 April 1996 the FRBSB informed Castors Braine that if FIBA did not issue the licence the club might be penalised and that if it fielded Mr Lehtonen it would do so at its own risk.
/->-13.Despite that warning Castors Braine fielded Mr Lehtonen in the match of 6 April 1996 against Belgacom Quaregnon. The match was won by Castors Braine. On 11 April 1996, following a complaint by Belgacom Quaregnon, the competition department of the FRBSB penalised Castors Braine by awarding to the other club by 20-0 the match in which Mr Lehtonen had taken part in breach of the FIBA rules on transfers ofplayers within the European zone. In the following match, against Pepinster, Castors Braine included Mr Lehtonen on the team sheet but in the end did not field him. The club was again penalised by the award of the match to the other club. As it ran the risk of being penalised again each time it included Mr Lehtonen on the team sheet, or even of being relegated to the lower division in the event of a third default, Castors Braine dispensed with the services of Mr Lehtonen for the play-off matches.
/->-14. On 16 April 1996 Mr Lehtonen and Castors Braine brought proceedings against the FRBSB in the Tribunal de Première Instance, Brussels, sitting to hear applications for interim relief. They sought essentially for the FRBSB to be ordered to lift the penalty imposed on Castors Braine for the match of 6 April 1996 against Belgacom Quaregnon, and to be prohibited from imposing any penalty whatever on the club preventing it from fielding Mr Lehtonen in the 1995/1996 Belgian championship, on pain of a monetary penalty of BEF 100 000 per day of delay in complying with the order.
HELD Musing on the meaning of employment -- "45. ...The essential feature of an employment relationship is that for a certain period of time a person performs services for and under the direction of another person, in return for which he receives remuneration."

+He shall enjoy *the same social and tax advantages* as national workers.
+He shall also, by virtue of the same right and under the same conditions as national workers, have *access to training* in vocational schools and retraining centres.

+Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, member states *may restrict* the *freedom of movement and residence* of Union citizens and their family members, irrespective of nationality, *on grounds of public policy, public security or public health*. These grounds *shall not* be invoked to *serve economic ends*.
+Measures taken on grounds of *public policy* or *public security* shall comply with the principle of *proportionality* and shall be *based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual* concerned. 
@@*Previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures*.
@@The personal *conduct of the individual* concerned must represent a *genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat* affecting one of the *fundamental interests* of society. Justifications that are *isolated from the particulars* of the case or that rely on considerations of general prevention shall not be accepted.
+In order to ascertain whether the person concerned represents a danger for public policy or public security, when issuing the registration certificate or, in the absence of a registration system, not later than three months from the date of arrival of the person concerned on its territory or from the date of reporting his/her presence within the territory, as provided for in Article 5(5), or when issuing the residence card, the host member state may, should it consider this essential, request the member state of origin and, if need be, other member states to provide information concerning any previous police record the person concerned may have. Such enquiries shall not be made as a matter of routine. The member state consulted shall give its reply within two months.
+The member state which issued the passport or identity card shall allow the holder of the document who has been expelled on grounds of public policy, public security, or public health from another member state to re-enter its territory without any formality even if the document is no longer valid or the nationality of the holder is in dispute.
