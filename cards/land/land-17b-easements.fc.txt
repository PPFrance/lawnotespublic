NAME Regency Villas v Diamond Resorts 
CITATION Regency Villas v Diamond Resorts (2015) EWHC
CATEGORY Easements
SUMMARY Claim to an easement to use a swimming pool and a golf club.
HELD Despite the ample textbook rhetoric about how you can't have an easement for a purely recreational purpose, this recent case may establish that in fact, you _can_.




NAME Canham v Fisk
CATEGORY Easements
HELD An easement is not extinguished by merger of dominant and servient tenements if there's an intention to re-separate the plots in future.

NAME Hill v Tupper
CATEGORY Easements
HELD The servient and dominant tenements of an easement need not be contiguous, but must be proximate. A _canal_ and a particular piece of land are _not_.

NAME Moody v Steggles
CATEGORY Easements
YEAR 1879
HELD An easement to signage may validly confer a business benefit on the dominant tenement. 

NAME Regency Villas v Diamond Resorts
CATEGORY Easements
AKA Regency Villas
CITATION Regency Villas v Diamond Resorts [2015] EWHC 3564
FLAGS Important
HELD The claim of an easement to the use of _leisure_ facilities was upheld, developing the law and going against dicta in |Moncrieff v Jamieson|. Potentially not inconsistent with requirement of _necessity_ for implication of an easement,  in light of evolving modern idea as to what in fact _is_ necessary. 

NAME Tara Hotels v Kensington
CATEGORY Easements
HELD If, as in |Coventry v Lawrence|, there can be an easement to make _noise_ -- which entails sound waves flooding from dominant to servient tenement -- then there can also be an easement for people to flood out from a fire-escape onto the burdened land. See also |Fenn Tigers|.

NAME Bachelor v Marlowe
CATEGORY Easements
CITATION Bachelor v Marlowe [2003] EWHC
HELD The test for whether the burden of a claimed easement is excessive is whether the servient owner _retains reasonable use_ of his land -- that it does not _render the servient owner's use illusory_.

NAME Moncreiff v Jamieson
CITATION Moncreiff v Jamieson [2007] UKHL 
CATEGORY Easements
HELD Per Lord Scott, the test for whether a claimed easement imposes an excessive burden should _not_ be whether the _servient owner retains reasonable use_, but whether he _retains control_ of the servient tenement. Doubted by Lord Neuberger. Obiter -- an easement of use of a swimming pool could _not_ be valid, as would require upkeep. Cf. |Regency Villas|.

NAME Crow v Wood
CATEGORY Easements
HELD Although the burden of an easement may not, in general, be _positive_ (i.e., necessitate that owner of burdened land must _do_ something), the _easement to fencing_ is an established exception.


NAME Cardwell v Walker
CATEGORY Easements
HELD The claim of an easement to the (paid) supply of electricity from a generator, to a caravan park, was upheld.

NAME Wright v Macadam
CATEGORY Easements
HELD The use of the burdened land entailed by a claimed easement must not be excessive. Nevertheless, because the owner of a shed used to store coal for the dominant tenement retained _access_, the claim succeeded. 

NAME R Square v Nissan
CATEGORY Easements
HELD An easement of parking was upheld despite that it was for _many_ cars, as the owner retained reasonable use.

NAME Copeland v Greenhalf
CATEGORY Easements
FLAGS Key
HELD A right claimed as an easement must be for something _specific_; not so general as to amount to _shared general use_ of the burdened land.  The use of an orchard to store vans, having evolved from the use established fifty years previously of mending wagon-wheels, was found to be an excessive burden on the land and did not per se confer a _specific_ benefit on the claimant's land. It amounted, instead, to a claim to shared use, and was therefore, decided per Upjohn J to be 'wholly outside the normal idea of an easement'.


NAME Emcer v Miller
CATEGORY Easements
HELD If the nature of the benefit/burden conferred/imposed necessarily entails _temporary exclusive use_, then it may nevertheless valid as the subject of an easement. Therefore, an easement of use of a lavatory was upheld.  

NAME Kettel v Bloomfold
CATEGORY Easements
HELD As long as the use of a garage is not _exclusive_, it may be capable of being an easement. The right to park a single car in a double garage (a hypothetical case in the |Law Commission Report on Easements|) could be capable, therefore, as long as the owner retains access. _What about a single garage where owner uses to store tools?_


NAME Fenn Tigers Case
AKA Fenn Tigers
CATEGORY Easements
HELD As in |Coventry v Lawrence|, the making of noise is capable of being an easement. 

NAME Phipps v Pears
CATEGORY Easements
FLAGS Denning
HELD Protection from the elements is _not_ capable of being an easement.


--------- IMPLIED CREATION ----------

NAME Walby v Walby
CATEGORY Easements; Implied Creation
HELD The implied creation of easements on grounds of necessity will only succeed if not to do so would render the land in question unusable, to a significant degree. That the implied easement would be _convenient_, by contrast, is not enough.

 

NAME Manjang v Drameh
CATEGORY Easements; Implied Creation
HELD A claim to imply an easement of access will fail to be sufficiently _necessary_, if another means of access is available. Even if that means by boat. 


NAME Stafford v Lee
CATEGORY Easements; Implied Creation
HELD When the parties' common intention in the transfer evinces that the plot will be used for a particular purpose, those easements _necessary for that use_ will be impliedly created. Such as, e.g., an easement to run sewerage pipes to serve a plot sold to build a house.

NAME Wong v Beaumont
CATEGORY Easements; Implied Creation
HELD The common intention of the parties to a transfer for the purpose of a restaurant will give rise to the implied easements necessary for that purpose -- such as ventilation shafts to carry away the smell of MSG and shrimp.


NAME Long v Gowlett
CATEGORY Easements; Implied Creation
HELD For S62(1) LPA to transform precarious personal rights into easements, there was a requirement of prior diversity of ownership or occupation. (No longer applies, since |Wood v Waddington| in 2015). 


NAME Sovmots v Environment Secretary
AKA Sovmots
CITATION Sovmots v Environment Secretary [1977] UKHL 3
CATEGORY Easements; Implied Creation
HELD Confirming the rule in |Long v Gowlett|, prior diversity of occupation or ownership was necessary for S62 creation of implied easements from personal permissions following transfer. (Not good law since |Wood v Waddington| in 2015).

NAME Bormann v Griffiths
CATEGORY Easements; Implied Creation
HELD S62(1) LPA only applies to transfers taking place by deed or registered disposition -- a claim relying on S62's means of implying easements from personal permissions, therefore, failed.

NAME Platt v Crouch
CITATION Platt v Crouch (2003)
CATEGORY Easements; Implied Creation
HELD Transforming personal rights into implied easements, under S62 of the LPA 1925, did _not_ require prior diversity of occupation. Confirmed in 2016 in |Wood v Waddington|.


NAME Wood v Waddington 
CITATION Wood v Waddington [2015] EWCA Civ 538
CATEGORY Easements; Implied Creation
FLAGS Key
HELD Confirming |Platt v Crouch|, implied easements created under S62 LPA 1925 does _not_ require prior diversity of occupation/ownership.


NAME Wheeldon v Burrows
CATEGORY Easements; Implied Creation
HELD Where the transfer fails formality requirements and is therefore only equitable, easements can nevertheless implied by similar means to S62 LPA. Although under S62 the rights must have been _continous and apparent_ immediately prior to transfer, the right in question under this rule is *either* _reasonable and apparent_ *or* _necessary for reasonable enjoyment*.
