NAME Easements
AKA Capable of Being Easement
SUMMARY ~*General*~
@From |Re Ellenborough Park|, an easement must have these four attributes: (i) dominant and servient tenements -- (ii) in separate occupation or ownership -- (iii) servient tenement confers benefit on dominant, and -- (iv) easement itself must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant.


SUMMARY ~*|Re Ellenborough Park| Criteria*~
/_For *capability* of being an easement._

+ *Both dominant and servient tenement*
@@ Can't exist without both. 
+ *Separate ownership ~or occupation~*
@@ Merger of plots via S29 TFV? 
@@@ Easement is *extinguished by merger* if intention to treat plots as one.
@@@ Easement is merely *suspended* if intention to re-separate in future. |Canham v Fisk|.
+ *Accommodation of dominant tenement*
@@ Proximity -- *but not contiguity* -- of plots is necessary. |Hill v Tupper|, a failed attempt to get an easement to run boats along a canal. Not _land_.
@@ |Moody v Steggles|, a pub sign.
@@ *Leisure*
@@@ Maybe possible after |Regency Villas v Diamond Resorts|.
+ *Capable of being subject matter of grant*
@@ Can be reduced to writing. 
@@ Legally-capable grantor and grantee. _N.B. Lunatics, bankrupts, minors, companies w/o capacity of grant in arts. of assoc., etc._
@@ |Tara Hotels v Kensington|, easement to *flood out* of a fire-escape, followed |Coventry v Lawrence| on basis of comparability of sound-waves. See also |Fenn Tigers|.


SUMMARY ~*Capability of a Right to be an Easement*~
+5 *No positive burden* on servient tenement.
@@ |Moncreiff v Jamieson|, obiter -- couldn't have an easement of a swimming pool, as would require upkeep. 
@@ Compatible with ratio of |Regency Villas|?
+0 _Exceptions_
@@ *Established*: easement to fencing. |Crow v Wood|.
@@ *Surprising*: easement to *generate and supply 'leccie*, |Cardwell v Walker|. 
@@@ Not quite so bonkers as that sounds, on its facts.
+6 *Impact not excessive* on burdened land. 
@@ Test in |Bachelor v Marlowe| (2003, EWHC) was whether servient owner's reasonable use is retained, and *not rendered illusory*. 
@@ Test in |Moncrieff v Jamieson| (2007, UKHL) per Lord Scott -- not whether servient owner retains reasonable use, but whether *retains control*. Lord Neuberger unconvinced.
@@ Wouldn't be practical. |Emcer v Miller|, use of lavatory, inherently entails such exclusion. 
@@ *Examples*
@@@ |Wright v Macadam| -- too much coal? Maybe, but use was not exclusive, therefore upheld.
@@@ |R Square v Nissan| -- too many cars? Nevertheless, upheld as owner retained right.
@@ *Must not amount to shared use*
@@@ The claimed right must be *specific*, not a claim to general use of the land. |Copeland v Greenhalf|.

SUMMARY ~*Notes*~
@ *Storage, Parking and Garages, etc*
@@ Double vs. single garage -- |Kettel v Bloomfold|.
@@ Garage with a lock? |Law Commission - Easements|.
@ *Incapable of Being Easements*
@ Protection from the weather -- |Phipps v Pears|, Denning MR, S62 LPA.

NAME Easements - Creation
SUMMARY ~*Intro*~
@*Express Creation*
/Legal if deed sent to LR, equitable otherwise.
@@*Agreement* -- the landowners collaborate, a deed is granted. 
@@*Splitting of land* -- in which easements are *reserved* in the transaction.
@*Implied Creation*
@@X sells part of the land to Y, but they fail:
@@@to mention the easements in the deed, and
@@@to exclude the creation of implied easements by an explicit clause per &g&S62(4) LPA 1925&g&.
@@_MD: "I've only ever seen cases about rights of way"._


SUMMARY *Situations for Implied Creation*
+*Absolute Necessity*
@@Without the claimed easement, the dominant tenement would be, to some significant degree, unusable. 
@@Not merely inconvenient. |Walby v Walby|.
@@An easement to a right of way will fail, when, instead, when you could go by boat (!) |Manjang v Drameh|.
+*Common Intention*
@@The easement is clearly necessary for the purpose for which the land was sold. E.g., splitting up a plot, and selling it to someone so they can build a house.
@@@Sewerage pipes -- |Stafford v Lee|.
@@@Ventilation shaft -- |Wong v Beaumont|. _MD -- a case everyone remembers as it involves a Chinese Restaurant (!)_
@@In principle, for *reservation* of easements. |Chaffe v Kingsley|.
+*S62 LPA* 
/Blackstone's _Property Law 2015-16_ at *p.61*
@@ Has been _read_ as implicitly converting _precarious_ rights, personal permissions, etc, in existence _before_ the transfer, into cast-iron easements. |Long v Gowlett|, the mill on the Cam, and |Sovmots|.
@@ _... but that's not what the words say._
@@ *Conditions*
+++ *Transfer by deed or RDP*, except of course legal leases up to 3 years. Inoperative for transfers by _contract_. |Bormann v Griffiths|.
+++ *No explicit exclusion* in deed, per S62(4).
+++ *|Capable of being easement|* 
+++ *Continuous and apparent* existence of rights immediately before sale. |Long v Gowlett|.

+++ *Prior diversity of occupation* -- needed in |Platt v Crouch| before |Wood v Waddington| confirmed |Platt v Crouch|, *not* now needed.
@@ SG -- _you don't sell an orange with the juice, the pips, the skin, the pith... you just sell the *orange*._
+ *|Wheeldon v Burrows|*
@@ Used to be like S62 without its prior-diversity requirement. 
@@ Now it is identical, except:
+++Transfer can be equitable as well.
+++Instead of the requirement of continuous and apparent existence, under |Wheeldon|, the right in question has to be _reasonable and apparent *and necessary for the reasonable enjoyment* of the land_.
@@ Like going to pick up a second-hand car, and being asked if you want the tyres as well.

SUMMARY *Prior Diversity*
@The ratio of |Wood v Waddington|, that prior diversity is _not_ necessary, introduces a danger for the seller.
@Sell the house and keep the field, and now, everything _you_ could do on the field, _they_ can now do.
