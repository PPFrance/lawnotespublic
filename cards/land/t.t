@From |Re Ellenborough Park|, an easement must have these four attributes: (i) dominant and servient tenements -- (ii) in separate occupation or ownership -- (iii) servient tenement confers benefit on dominant, and -- (iv) easement itself must be capable of forming the subject matter of a grant.
SUMMARY ~*|Re Ellenborough Park| criteria*~
@@@ Easement is merely *suspended* if intention to re-separate in future. |Canham v Fisk|.
@@ Proximity -- *but not contiguity* -- of plots is necessary. |Hill v Tupper|, a failed attempt to get an easement to run boats along a canal. Not _land_.
@@ |Moody v Steggles|, a pub sign.
@@@ Maybe possible after |Regency Villas v Diamond Resorts|.
@@ |Tara Hotels v Kensington|, easement to *flood out* of a fire-escape, followed |Coventry v Lawrence| on basis of comparability of sound-waves.
@@ |Moncreiff v Jamieson|, obiter -- couldn't have an easement of a swimming pool, as would require upkeep. 
@@ Compatible with ratio of |Regency Villas|?
@@ *Established* -- easement to fencing. |Crow v Wood|.
@@ *Surprising* -- easement to *generate and supply 'leccie*, |Cardwell v Walker|. 
@@ |Wright v Macadam| -- too much coal.
@@ |R Square v Nissan| -- too many cars.
@@ |Copeland v Greenhalf| -- too much use of orchard
@@ Test in |Bachelor v Marlowe| (2003, EWHC) was whether servient owner's reasonable use is retained, and *not rendered illusory*. 
@@ Test in |Moncrieff v Jamieson| (2007, UKHL) per Lord Scott: not whether servient owner retains reasonable use, but whether *retains control*. Neuberger unconvinced.
@@ Wouldn't be practical. |Emcer v Miller|, use of lavatory, inherently entails such exclusion. 
@ Double vs. single garage -- |Kettel v Bloomfold|.
@ Garage with a lock? |Law Commission - Easements|.
