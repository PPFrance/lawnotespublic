SUMMARY ~*Summary*~
/Also spelled 'squatting.' Acquisition of title by long use or control. 
SUMMARY Most successful adverse possessors are white, middle-class folk, although not the dreadlocks-and-weed type of white middle-class folk you might imagine. |Pye v Graham|, |Zarb v Parry|.
SUMMARY It may impress or disgust as deeply pretentious to state, in an exam, '&g&nec vi, nec clam, nec precario&g&'. 


SUMMARY The AP's occupation may well be _deliberate_ occupation of land to which they _knew they had no right_.  No matter.  AP works like |proprietary estoppel| gone to the bad -- it stops the paper RP from enforcing their right of possession against the AP. 
@Hence its infrequently-used name 'limitation of {TODO what?!}.' 

SUMMARY The AP gains has a seaworthy property right that they can sell, inherit, register, etc, like any other. Or on which they can gain a possession order _against the registered proprietor_.

SUMMARY The three |conditions for adverse possession| are:
/->- 1. *control* of the land: |Pye v Graham|, |Red House v Catchpole| -- 2. *intention to possess*: |Bucks v Moran| -- 3. *not accepting permission*, if offered. 
SUMMARY The three sets of |circumstances for adverse possession| are: 
/->- 1. *unregistered* land -- 2. registered land with adverse possession of *12 years before 13th Oct 2013* -- 3. idem with 10 years *ending after* that date.
@To which, three exceptions: 
/->-(a) *honest and reasonable boundary disputes* (|Zarb v Parry|) -- (b) *estoppel* and, spuriously -- (c) *"other reasons"*.

SUMMARY A clear policy goal of |LRA 2002| was to make it vanishingly difficult for squatters to gain possession. In this it largely succeeded.
@S15 of the |Limitation Act 1980| (codifying the common law) had the length of use at *12 years*, and there was no notification of the original RP. 
@|Schedule 6|(1)(1) allows registration after *10 years*, but with a subsequent *2 years* for the original RP to object and regain possession


SUMMARY ~*Attributes of AP*~
/It is:
@Rooted in the organic and uncontrived nature of land law.
@An instance of land law having: followed and _formalised how people behave in practice_, rather than how they should, thereby _making best use of a scarce resource_, land, and; arbitrating legal disputes for which not much external or documentary evidence could be produced.
@Historically then, it had a weighty practical justification.
$ It is also:
@Consistent with European HR law according to the Grand Chamber in |Pye v UK|, because:
@@AP is in the public interest, and within the 'margin of appreciation'.
/(Although n.b., the First Tier chamber _had_ found squatting to be a breach.)
$ And furthermore, it's also:
@*Powerful*. The English Common Law version being the _most_ powerful.

SUMMARY ~*Criminal Offence*~
/In certain circumstances, AP of _residential_ property is an offence attracting a £5K fine, or up to 51 weeks in jail.
@Parliament buried this deep within |LAPSO 2012|, after a whole 90 minutes of late-night debate.
@It's retroactive, affecting APs in possession on the day the law came into force. 
SUMMARY Potentially, you could go to jail for this but nevertheless gain the title by AP.
@|Best v Chief Land Registrar|, in which the LR had refused to register, on principle of _ex turpi causa_. 
@Best had _not_ been charged or convicted of anything. 
@The EWCA held the CLR's contention of _ex turpi causa_ inapplicable, and not to have been in the contemplation of parliament.
@Watch this space.

SUMMARY *Blackstone's* Property Law 2015-2016 -- *p. 121-122*
SUMMARY ~*Intro*~
/*Repealed* by the 2002 act, except for references to S75(1) |Schedule 12|(18), applying to claims of adverse possession where the 12 years were *completed before 13th Oct 2013*.
SUMMARY ~*S75 -- Acquisition of title by possession*~
+The Limitation Acts shall apply to registered land in the same manner and to the same extent as those Acts apply to land not registered, except that where, if the land were not registered, the estate of the person registered as proprietor would be extinguished, such estate shall not be extinguished but shall be deemed to be held by the proprietor for the time being in trust for the person who, by virtue of the said Acts, has acquired title against any proprietor, but without prejudice to the estates and interests of any other person interested in the land whose estate or interest is not extinguished by those Acts.
+Any person claiming to have acquired a title under the Limitation Acts to a registered estate in the land may apply to be registered as proprietor thereof.
+The registrar shall, on being satisfied as to the applicant’s title, enter the applicant as proprietor either with absolute, good leasehold, qualified, or possessory title, as the case may require, but without prejudice to any estate or interest protected by any entry on the register which may not have been extinguished under the Limitation Acts, and such registration shall, subject as aforesaid, have the same effect as the registration of a first proprietor; but the proprietor or the applicant or any other person interested may apply to the court for the determination of any question arising under this section.
