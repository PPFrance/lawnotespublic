Preamble: home strait of LR, which consisted of titles, registered charges, OIs and registered protected interests.

NAME Registered Protected Interests
AKA RPIs
TYPE Concept
CATEGORY Registered Protected Interests
SUMMARY *~Intro~*
/|S29 LRA| provides that the transferee for value of a registered disposition takes the land free of every obligation except |Overriding Interests| and *things on the register*. This means *Registered Protected Interests*, RPIs, and was the big innovation of the |LRA 2002|. 
SUMMARY The basic proposition is this -- *(i)* rights should be registered; and *(ii)* by virtue of registration, they are *protected*.

SUMMARY For titles and mortgages, the registration is what *creates* the right. RPIs, on the other hand, are rights *already in existence*. Putting them on the register merely *protects* them.
SUMMARY This is where *third party* rights are to be found -- short term leases, mortgages, etc. They're entered by the right-holder, and not the title-holder.

SUMMARY ~*Scope*~
SUMMARY Every type of property right apart from those which must be registered under |S29 LRA| can be an RPI. They're listed in |S38 LRA|. We're interested in _three_ -- 
+*Interests behind |Trusts of Land|*
@@X is the RP, but holds the land on trust for X and Y, e.g., himself and his wife.
@@They're designed with |Overreaching| in mind. Y's right isn't _meant_ to bite the land, for the sake of maintaining its alienability.
/_N.B., in this example, Y's interest may in fact be an |Overriding Interest|, and so _not_ overreachable._
@@@{Exam advice: don't make the mistake of stating that you can register a share of co-ownership. Don't do this, because you _can’t_, and saying so means you’ve understood, essentially, _fuck all_.}
+*Leases of One Year or Less*
@@Either *legal*, overriding under |Schedule 3|(1), or *equitable*, overriding (if in actual occupation) under |Schedule 3|(2).
+*_Leasehold_ covenants*
@@E.g., an obligation to pay rent; to maintain in a certain state of repair; not use in a certain way; not to alienate by subletting or selling.
/(Cf. |Freehold Covenants|, which _should_ be registered.)
@@These things are agreed as a matter of contract for _short_ leases.
@@But what happens if tenant sells the lease to T2, and the landlord then sells the freehold to L2.
@@@Do the leasehold covenants still bind T2 and L2?  Will they _run with_ the land?
/{This is regulated by the |Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995|. Whilst this is _technically_ on the syllabus, don't be surprised if it's _not_ in the exam, simply because it takes about ten hours to explain to pupils at Falcon, Wilberforce, Serle Court and Landmark, let alone a bunch of sullen GDL students}

SUMMARY ~*Registration of Protected Interests -- Notices*~
/These are either *unilateral* or *agreed*. Both offer the same protection, a unilateral Notice is not _weaker_.
+*Agreed Notices*
@@They *contain the details* of the right.
@@They may be arranged between parties, _or_ may be imposed by court order. 
@@They cannot subsequently be challenged, but can be removed on expiration.
+*Unilateral Notices*~
@@They *merely contain the fact* of the right.
@@Subject a plausible prima facie justification, the Notice is (i) entered on the register; and (ii) the title-holder is informed.
@@In response they may then ask for the Notice to be _vacated_.
@@But between (i) and the response to (ii), if any, the right is legally protected.
+0N.B.: _Commercial situations in which the protection afforded by a Notice is desirable, but the disclosure of details entailed by an Agreed Notice is _not_, there may be contractual terms  stipulating the use of a Unilateral Notice -- or precluding making an entry.
@E.g., Duke of Westminster shopping centre scenario, in which, to avoid the each short-term lessee knowing the terms of each other's terms and rent. So unilateral notices don’t necessarily mean a dispute._

SUMMARY ~*Registration of Protected Interests -- Restrictions*~
/These don't protect a right; they inhibit the RP from something. 
@By consequence this may of course amount to an indirect protection of rights. A Restriction on _sale_ would preclude a right-holder losing out in an S29 priority dispute.
@@E.g., an equitable _option_ is granted (i.e., by _deed_) for five years.
@@This could be registered as an Agreed Notice.
@@But should you want to keep the price confidential, the better bet would be to apply for a Restriction on the title preventing _sale_ without your consent, instead.
@@@|Mortgagees| sometimes (irrelevantly) put these on your land.
SUMMARY By contrast to Notices, anyone can apply for a Restriction on a title, not just those with property rights.
