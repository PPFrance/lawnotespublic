NAME Walker v Burton
CATEGORY Land Registration; Title Guarantee
CATEGORY Mistakes on the Register; Innocent Mistakes; Alteration; Rectification
SUMMARY Burton bought a manor next to a fell. He subsequently discovered, so he thought, that the manor gave him the fell. He asked the LR to register it for him -- they did so. Intent, it seems, on rubbing everyone up the wrong way, he put a fence around the fell, and stopped the villagers from, e.g., parking on it.  Villagers including the claimant challenged this on the grounds that the land was in fact *common land*. They were correct. At some point in the 1400s, the land had been conveyed away. 
HELD The mistaken registration of a disposition to which there is no other claimant will not give rise to rectification.  The claim to correct the mistaken registration of _a large chunk of moorland_ merely because it seemed unjust, failed. Obiter -- it was better to have _someone_ rather than _no one_ taking care of the land.

NAME Gold Harp v MacLeod
AKA Gold Harp
CITATION Gold Harp Properties Ltd v MacLeod [2014] EWCA Civ 1084
LINK Dixon Article 
CATEGORY Mistakes on the Register; Fraud
CATEGORY Land Registration; Title Guarantee
SUMMARY A property developer with a long lease to _roof space_ persuaded the LR to close the titles of some short leaseholders they wished to dislodge from the same space, by dishonestly claiming the titles were validly forfeited. A long lease was granted to a friend, which was assigned through various companies until it ended up with Gold Harp.
SUMMARY At first instance, the judge found the forfeitures invalid in several ways, and ordered rectification -- but that the purportedly forfeit short-term leases be entered against the _freehold_ rather than the long lease. The question on appeal was whether Gold Harp had priority over the short-term lessors.

HELD _from wl:_ "(1) The judge had been entitled to order that J's title numbers should take priority. J's and G's leases fell within the subject matter of Sch.4 para.8. The primary effect of that provision was to confirm that the power to rectify the register was not limited to simply restoring an interest, but extended to changing what would otherwise be its priority."  {TODO *still* to do, ffs.}

NAME Malory v Cheshire
AKA Malory
CITATION Malory Enterprises v Cheshire Homes [2002] EWCA Civ 151
CATEGORY Land Registration; Title Guarantee; Fraud
CATEGORY Mistakes on the Register; Fraud; Right to Apply for Rectification as Property Right
FLAGS Overruled
HELD (i) The right to apply for rectification is a property right. (ii) Registration by fraud did not give a _disposition_ within the meaning of |LRA 1925|; merely the bare legal title. The beneficial interest remained with the defrauded party. (Overruled on the second point by |Swift 1st| for having undermined the plain intention of |S58 LRA 2002|). 


NAME Fitzwilliam v Richall
AKA Fitzwilliam
CITATION Fitzwilliam v Richall [2013] EWHC 86 (Ch)
FLAGS Overruled
CATEGORY Mistakes on the Register; Fraud; Unravelling; Rectification
CATEGORY Land Registration; Title Guarantee
HELD When B fraudulently obtains title by registration of A's land which he then transfers to C, equity will unravel the whole transaction, and rectification will not be necessary to restore the title to A. But as there is no rectification, there will be no indemnity payable to C.  Following |Malory|, fraudulent registration only confers *bare legal title* (overturned in |Swift 1st|).

NAME Swift 1st v Chief Land Registrar
AKA Swift 1st
CITATION Swift 1st v Chief Land Registrar [2015] EWCA Civ 330
CATEGORY Mistakes on the Register; Fraud; Indemnities
CATEGORY Land Registration; Title Guarantee
FLAGS Key
HELD Indemnities are owed for loss as a consequence of rectification of a mistake, even when the mistake occurs through fraud. Such registration confers title definitively -- |S58 LRA 2002|.  |Malory| and |Fitzwilliam| erred in deciding such circumstances only gave rise to the bare legal title and not the equitable interest.




NAME Knights Construction v Roberto Mac
AKA Roberto Mac
CATEGORY Mistakes on the Register; Rectification
FLAGS Key
SUMMARY Knights Construction was the rightful proprietor, but the title had been registered wrongly to Roberto Mac. 
HELD A mistake in the register is to be rectified when the RP to whom the title was wrongly registered is *not in possession*.



NAME Baxter v Mannion
CATEGORY Mistakes on the Register; Rectification
FLAGS Key
HELD When a wrongful RP is in possession, the threshold for rectification of the register on grounds of unfairness under |Schedule 4|(3)(2)(b) is *high*. Merely having lost title to the land is not enough. The unconscionability of a wrongful RP's connivance in the mistake, however, strongly militates in favour of rectification.
HELD The register _was_ rectified, as the defendant had behaved unconscionably.

NAME Cooper v Gick 
COURT LR Tribunal
CATEGORY Mistakes on the Register; Rectification
FLAGS Informative
HELD When a wrongful RP is in possession but *bears no blame for the mistake* in the register, it would be unfair not to rectify.

NAME Williams v Mitchell
CATEGORY Mistakes on the Register; Indemnities
HELD When rectification of the register would prejudicially affect the new RP's title, the usual remedy for the claimant will be indemnities from the Land Registry rather than rectification.

CATEGORY Title Guarantee
HELD When land is fraudulently transferred from A to B, then should the land subsequently be transferred to an innocent party C but A should _fail_ to register a unilateral |Notice| against the title when the mistake comes to his attention, C's title will be good, and A's claim for rectification will fail.
